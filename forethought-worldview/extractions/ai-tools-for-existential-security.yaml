  title: "AI Tools for Existential Security"

premises_taken_as_given:
  - claim: "Rapid AI progress is the greatest driver of existential risk in the world today."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "Stated as the opening line without argument; treated as motivating context for the entire paper."
  - claim: "Existential risk reduction is a valid and important priority for directing resources and talent."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "The paper addresses an 'existential risk community' and recommends large fractions of its members shift focus; the value of existential risk work is never defended."
  - claim: "AI capabilities will continue advancing rapidly, with cognitive automation becoming increasingly comprehensive."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "The paper assumes a world of 'abundant cognition' is coming and that 'AI systems will be responsible for increasing fractions of important work — likely at some point a clear majority.'"
  - claim: "The relative ordering and timing of different AI capabilities matters enormously for outcomes."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "Central framing device: the paper's entire value proposition rests on the idea that flipping the order of risk-generating and risk-reducing capabilities can have outsized impact."
  - claim: "Misaligned power-seeking AI is a serious risk pathway."
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "Mentioned as a scenario that automating alignment research could help avert ('lose control of the world to misaligned power-seeking AI systems'), treated as a recognized concern rather than argued for."
  - claim: "Lock-in of values or power structures is a real risk and coordination tools could contribute to it."
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "Acknowledged as a downside of coordination tools — 'if humanity locks in certain choices before we are really wise enough to choose correctly' — treated as a known concern."
  - claim: "Market forces alone are insufficient to produce safety-relevant AI applications on the needed timeline."
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "The paper argues 'the market has gaps, and needs time to work' and that AI is a growth industry where opportunities exceed current effort."

distinctive_claims:
  - claim: "The existential risk community should make accelerating specific beneficial AI applications a central focus, with ~30% of the field working on it today and eventually more than 50%."
    centrality: "thesis"
    key_argument: "Beneficial AI applications are undervalued in x-risk work; they are tractable to accelerate, can be pursued unilaterally, and their importance will only grow as cognition becomes abundant."
  - claim: "Even small (weeks-to-months) acceleration of specific AI applications can matter enormously, because it can flip the ordering of risk-generating and risk-reducing capabilities."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "During rapid capability progress, small timing differences represent large capability differences, and achieving risk-reducing capabilities before corresponding risk-generating ones could be decisive."
  - claim: "Accelerating beneficial applications is more tractable than slowing dangerous capabilities, because acceleration can be done unilaterally while delay requires consensus."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "Explicit contrast drawn: pursuing acceleration doesn't require coordinating with competitors or adversaries, unlike restraint."
  - claim: "Three clusters of AI applications — epistemic, coordination-enabling, and risk-targeted — map onto the three crucial steps of navigating existential risks (identifying challenges, coordinating on strategies, implementing strategies)."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "The taxonomy is presented as covering the key intervention points; other applications are acknowledged but deprioritized."
  - claim: "Practical strategies for acceleration include curating datasets, building scaffolding, shaping compute allocation, and removing non-AI barriers to adoption."
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "These target different bottlenecks in the AI application pipeline and are actionable now, before the underlying capabilities fully mature."
  - claim: "People working on existential risk should plan for a world of abundant cognition, identifying currently-impractical strategies that will become viable and recognizing that some current work will be obsoleted."
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "Cognitive automation will change what's feasible; preparing now avoids being caught flat-footed."
  - claim: "Automated negotiation tools could help overcome racing dynamics in AI development by finding mutually desirable alternatives."
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "Negotiation failures — from bandwidth constraints, many parties, or information asymmetries — are a key barrier to coordination; AI could address these."

positions_rejected:
  - position: "The primary strategy for x-risk reduction should be slowing down dangerous AI capabilities."
    why_rejected: "Slowing dangerous capabilities requires consensus and coordination among competitors, making it harder to pursue; acceleration of beneficial applications can be done unilaterally and is more tractable."
  - position: "Market forces will ensure beneficial AI applications emerge on a sufficient timeline without targeted intervention."
    why_rejected: "The market has gaps, needs time to work, and AI is a growth industry with more opportunities than are being captured; some critical applications are not obviously commercially valuable."
  - position: "It's too early or impractical to work on accelerating specific AI applications for existential security."
    why_rejected: "Five years ago this might have been a stretch, but today it's 'realistic and viable'; waiting means missing compounding benefits and critical windows."
  - position: "Direct technical work on x-risk is generally higher leverage than working on differential AI development."
    why_rejected: "Differential AI development allows directing much larger quantities of cognitive labor and is under-explored relative to its importance."
  - position: "Indirect applications (e.g. crop production improving food security) should be prioritized equally with the three core clusters."
    why_rejected: "Acknowledged as potentially helpful but deprioritized; the three clusters map directly onto the crucial steps for navigating existential risks."

methodological_commitments:
  - "Categorization-based reasoning: organizing applications into taxonomies (epistemic, coordination-enabling, risk-targeted) mapped to functional needs."
  - "Strategic/consequentialist reasoning about counterfactual impact and timing, rather than formal modeling."
  - "Emphasis on tractability and unilateral action as key criteria for recommending interventions."
  - "Pipeline analysis: decomposing AI application development into stages (data, training, post-training, compute, non-AI barriers) to identify intervention points."
  - "Community-level strategic advice: reasoning about optimal allocation of talent and resources across the existential risk field."
  - "Qualitative scenario reasoning with visual diagrams illustrating timing dynamics, rather than quantitative probability estimates."
