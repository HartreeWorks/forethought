  title: "Intelsat as a Model for International AGI Governance"

premises_taken_as_given:
  - claim: "AGI (AI performing as well as the most capable humans at essentially all economically relevant cognitive tasks) is a coherent category that may be developed in the relatively near future."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "The paper defines AGI precisely and builds its entire governance proposal around it without arguing for its feasibility or timeline, treating it as a planning assumption."
  - claim: "AGI is a fundamentally general-purpose, primarily commercial technology with enormous strategic and military significance."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "Stated in the abstract as the motivating premise for why Intelsat is a better analogy than Manhattan Project or CERN; the commercial framing is asserted without defense."
  - claim: "The US currently leads in AGI development and will likely seek to preserve a dominant position in any multilateral arrangement."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "Treated as background fact throughout; the entire governance model is designed around US primacy as a constraint."
  - claim: "Any feasible model for international AGI governance must be desirable from a US perspective."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "Stated explicitly multiple times as a design constraint, not argued for—taken as a political reality."
  - claim: "Some degree of centralization or coordination in AGI development is likely desirable or perhaps inevitable."
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "The paper explicitly notes it doesn't argue for whether centralization is desirable, but the entire framing presupposes that centralized multilateral projects are worth designing; it says 'to the extent that centralizing AGI development is desirable or inevitable.'"
  - claim: "AGI could trigger explosive economic growth and produce unprecedented returns on capital."
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "Cited as a possibility (referencing Erdil and Besiroglu 2024) that shapes the benefit-sharing and agreement feasibility analysis, but acknowledged as uncertain."
  - claim: "Historical analogies are useful for reasoning about AGI governance institutions."
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "The entire methodology depends on this; the paper treats institutional precedent as providing genuine evidence about feasibility and design."
  - claim: "Speed of establishing governance arrangements for AGI matters greatly, potentially within a 5-year window."
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "Explicitly stated as a consideration—'if AGI is developed within the next 5 years, there will be limited time'—but hedged with 'whether or not AGI is near.'"

distinctive_claims:
  - claim: "Intelsat is a more appropriate historical model for international AGI governance than the Manhattan Project or CERN, because AGI is fundamentally a commercial general-purpose technology."
    centrality: "thesis"
    key_argument: "Manhattan Project and CERN are military/scientific analogues; AGI's primarily commercial nature makes the commercial-strategic hybrid model of Intelsat a better fit."
  - claim: "Strategic importance of a technology can be a reason FOR multilateral development rather than against it—the US chose multilateralism for satellites precisely because of their strategic value."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "Historical evidence shows the US unilaterally committed to multilateral satellite development to win soft power advantages it couldn't achieve alone; this inverts the intuition that strategic importance demands unilateral control."
  - claim: "Weighted voting with supermajorities for important decisions is a politically feasible governance mechanism that balances US dominance with meaningful allied influence."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "Intelsat's interim agreements demonstrate this worked in practice, with the US holding 60.1% but requiring European support for key decisions."
  - claim: "Interim agreements with a small number of founding allies, with renegotiation commitments, can enable rapid establishment of multilateral projects."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "Intelsat went from no international discussions to signed agreements in 2 years, and global satellite coverage in 5 years after that, by starting small and deferring disagreements."
  - claim: "The formation of a multilateral project creates an opportunity to steer technological trajectories in desirable directions (differential technological development)."
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "Without Intelsat, AT&T would have built medium-altitude satellites serving only developed nations; the multilateral project enabled the US to push for geosynchronous satellites with global coverage."
  - claim: "Key disanalogies between satellites and AGI (larger benefits, greater military significance, lower government involvement, greater US dependence on allies) don't undermine the Intelsat model and in some cases strengthen it."
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "Larger benefits make agreement easier via diminishing returns; greater US dependence on allies increases mutual desirability of cooperation; military concerns are manageable with limited membership (e.g. Five Eyes)."
  - claim: "Broad benefit-sharing (including to non-members and within member states) becomes particularly important when benefits are potentially enormous, to reduce inequality and preserve stability."
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "If AGI benefits are vast, concentration of those benefits could destabilize international relations and domestic politics; benefit-sharing is framed as a stability mechanism."

positions_rejected:
  - position: "The Manhattan Project is the best historical analogy for an international AGI project."
    why_rejected: "AGI is primarily commercial and general-purpose, unlike nuclear weapons; the Manhattan Project model implies military secrecy and unilateral development, which misses AGI's commercial character."
  - position: "CERN is the best historical analogy for an international AGI project."
    why_rejected: "CERN is a scientific research organization; AGI development is commercially driven with enormous economic stakes, making a commercial-strategic model more apt."
  - position: "The US should develop AGI unilaterally given its technological lead."
    why_rejected: "Even with a dominant position in satellite technology, the US chose multilateralism because it served US interests better (soft power, preventing monopoly, ensuring global coverage); similar logic applies to AGI, especially given greater US dependence on allies for supply chains and talent."
  - position: "International AGI governance should involve all nations from the start (e.g. through the UN)."
    why_rejected: "Intelsat's history shows that starting with a small group of allies enables speed and avoids obstruction by adversaries; broader membership can come later through tiered arrangements."
  - position: "Decentralized or non-centralized AGI development is clearly preferable."
    why_rejected: "Not strongly rejected but explicitly set aside—the paper acknowledges this is possible but notes the Intelsat model is relevant 'to the extent that centralizing AGI development is desirable or inevitable.'"

methodological_commitments:
  - "Historical analogy as primary evidence: uses a single detailed case study (Intelsat) to derive governance design principles for AGI."
  - "Policy-oriented feasibility analysis: consistently evaluates proposals against political constraints, especially US willingness to participate."
  - "Explicit acknowledgment of disanalogies: systematically identifies and assesses differences between the historical case and the target domain, rather than only emphasizing similarities."
  - "Realist/interest-based international relations framing: analyzes state behavior in terms of national interest, bargaining power, and strategic advantage rather than normative ideals."
  - "Modular and incremental institutional design: favors interim agreements, tiered membership, and iterative renegotiation over comprehensive grand bargains."
  - "Qualitative reasoning over formal models: no quantitative modeling or expected value calculations; relies on narrative historical evidence and structured argumentation."
