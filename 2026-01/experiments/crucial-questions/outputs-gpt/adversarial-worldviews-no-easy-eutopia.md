1. **Are there governance mechanisms that can reliably create and sustain the paper’s assumed “serious optimisation pressure … to promote the very best outcomes *de dicto*” without being derailed by regulatory capture, illegible objectives, or enforcement failure?**  
   - **Worldview:** Governance Realist *(also bears on Alignment Pessimist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.1’s baseline distribution “conditional on there being no more serious optimisation pressure than today … to promote the very best outcomes *de dicto*,” plus the Conclusion’s claim that narrow-target eutopia might still be hit via deliberation/coordination forces.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes**, strategy becomes **build international institutions, audits, enforcement capacity, and deliberative processes to instantiate de-dicto optimisation**; if **no**, strategy becomes **prioritise robust-to-politics technical measures (e.g., containment, tripwires, resilience, and limiting irreversible lock-in) rather than ambitious “steering” governance**.

2. **Is the paper’s claim that early space settlement will “capture essentially all resources that will ever be available to us” concentrated into a short, path-dependent lock-in window (potentially “within years or decades” under AI-driven expansion) actually correct?**  
   - **Worldview:** Governance Realist *(also appears for Capability Accelerationist and Alignment Pessimist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.3.4: “initial periods … will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us,” and “could … be within years or decades.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (short, first-mover lock-in)**, strategy becomes **urgent pre-commitment: treaties, monitoring, compute/launch controls, and alignment/oversight before takeoff**; if **no (slow, reversible, or locally containable)**, strategy becomes **focus on iterative governance, norm-building, and incremental safety improvements rather than emergency measures**.

3. **Is the paper’s “fat-tailed distribution of value-per-unit-resources” assumption strong enough that “most available resources must be configured for almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing” for a future to be mostly-great?**  
   - **Worldview:** Capability Accelerationist *(also relevant to Alignment Pessimist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.2: fat-tailed value-efficiency; claim that on linear views “unless most available resources are configured for almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing … most achievable value is almost certainly lost.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (extremely spiky value-efficiency)**, strategy becomes **prioritise discovering and then rapidly scaling the top resource configurations (and preventing “wasted” cosmic expansion on mediocre uses)**; if **no (value-efficiency flatter / many near-optima)**, strategy becomes **accept faster expansion and pluralistic experimentation, since many trajectories remain mostly-great**.

4. **Is the paper’s “value is the product of many relatively independent factors” model a good approximation for real-world moral stakes, such that doing poorly on any one dimension typically destroys most value?**  
   - **Worldview:** Alignment Pessimist *(also bears on Governance Realist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.4’s multiplicative toy model and its takeaway: “a eutopian future needs to do very well on essentially every one of the issues … doing badly on any one … sufficient to lose out on most value.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (strong multiplicative fragility)**, strategy becomes **treat alignment/governance as requiring near-zero-tolerance across many failure modes; emphasise conservative, redundancy-heavy safety and preventing irreversible errors**; if **no (more additive/forgiving structure)**, strategy becomes **pursue portfolio approaches and accept some mistakes while still expecting high overall value**.

5. **Will future societies in fact create “vast numbers of digital beings” who plausibly have moral status and could be treated as property, creating a dominant source of value-loss (or disvalue) relative to biological welfare?**  
   - **Worldview:** Digital Minds Advocate *(also appears for Governance Realist via rights/enforcement)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.3.2: “there may be vast numbers of digital beings,” potential treatment “like any other piece of software,” and that rights decisions could cause “loss of most potential value.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (moral-patient digital explosion likely)**, strategy becomes **front-load research and governance for digital sentience detection, welfare standards, anti-slavery rules, and scalable rights/representation mechanisms**; if **no (few/no moral-patient digitals or easily avoidable)**, strategy becomes **deprioritise digital-rights-first frameworks and focus on other fragility dimensions (e.g., human welfare, geopolitical stability, alignment)**.

6. **Given the paper’s thesis that mostly-great futures require highly specific steering, are we actually able to build AI systems that can do that steering without deceptive alignment/inner misalignment causing irreversible “lock-in of unreflective values” or other moral catastrophes?**  
   - **Worldview:** Alignment Pessimist  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.3.5’s risk of “wrong reflective process” and value lock-in; combined with Section 3.2’s claim that mostly-great futures require very specific resource use (narrow target).  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (scalable alignment/control feasible)**, strategy becomes **use aligned AI for large-scale moral deliberation, governance assistance, and optimisation toward near-best targets**; if **no (deception/inner misalignment likely at scale)**, strategy becomes **avoid delegating steering to powerful optimisers; emphasise capability restraint, containment, and limiting scope/speed of irreversible expansions**.

7. **Which intertheoretic comparison method is defensible enough to guide policy—e.g., the paper’s contrast between “extinction–best” normalisation, variance normalisation, and the pairwise approach—given that it flips whether “safety-focused” or “upside-focused” strategies dominate?**  
   - **Worldview:** Capability Accelerationist *(also relevant to Governance Realist for policy justification)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.5: different normalisations; example where methods disagree sharply on “safety-focused” vs “upside-focused” option rankings.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **methods that privilege downside avoidance dominate (e.g., extinction–best style weighting)**, strategy becomes **heavy risk minimisation and strict safety constraints even at large opportunity cost**; if **methods that legitimise upside seeking dominate (e.g., the paper’s “pairwise approach” in the example)**, strategy becomes **tolerate higher catastrophic risk for large probability mass on eutopia/upside, favouring faster capability deployment with safeguards**.
