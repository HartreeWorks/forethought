**Is the paper’s “fat-tailed distribution of value-per-unit-resources” assumption strong enough that “most available resources must be configured for almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing” for a future to be mostly-great?**  
   - **Worldview:** Capability Accelerationist *(also relevant to Alignment Pessimist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.2: fat-tailed value-efficiency; claim that on linear views “unless most available resources are configured for almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing … most achievable value is almost certainly lost.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (extremely spiky value-efficiency)**, strategy becomes **prioritise discovering and then rapidly scaling the top resource configurations (and preventing “wasted” cosmic expansion on mediocre uses)**; if **no (value-efficiency flatter / many near-optima)**, strategy becomes **accept faster expansion and pluralistic experimentation, since many trajectories remain mostly-great**.
