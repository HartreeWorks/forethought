**Is the morally relevant “disvalue of bads” effectively unbounded or so asymmetric that even a \(\sim 10^{-22}\) fraction of resources used toward bads prevents a mostly-great future (making suffering-minimisation lexically dominant)?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** On separate-aggregation bounded views: “we don’t reach a mostly-great future if as little as *one resource in \(10^{22}\)* is used toward bads rather than goods” (Sec. 3.1.1 / 3.3), and “if … disvalue … is much greater … then an even smaller quantity of bads would be sufficient to outweigh any utopian future” (Sec. 3.3).  
   - **The flip:** If bads are unbounded below or asymmetry is so extreme that \(\text{(tolerable bad fraction)} \ll 10^{-22}\), then **prioritise preventing any large-scale suffering/“bads” channels (s-risk style strategy), even at the cost of slowing expansion/optimisation**; if bads are bounded/symmetric enough that \(\text{(tolerable bad fraction)} \gg 10^{-22}\), then **prioritise scaling goods and broad flourishing (including expansion) with reasonable safeguards**.  
   - **What would answer it:** A targeted moral-uncertainty analysis that (i) elicits where reflective-equilibrium judgments place upper/lower bounds and asymmetry, and (ii) stress-tests those judgments against the paper’s “scale” thought experiments (galaxy-scale mixtures of goods/bads) to infer the implied asymmetry/“tolerable bad fraction.”
