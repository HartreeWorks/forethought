**What is the effective number of near-independent “value-critical” dimensions \(N\) (and their dependence structure) such that overall future value behaves roughly like a product of factors?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “we can capture … eutopian fragility by seeing the value of the future as the *product of many factors* … mostly-great futures are rare” and the toy model where increasing \(N\) makes expected value collapse (Sec. 2.4).  
   - **The flip:** If effective \(N \le 2\) or factors are strongly correlated (so one kind of progress reliably fixes many dimensions), then **broad capability/prosperity growth and generic good governance** likely suffice; if effective \(N \ge 5\) with weak correlations, then **targeted work to avoid many distinct moral failure modes (multi-domain governance, moral circle/rights design, value reflection, etc.)** dominates.  
   - **What would answer it:** A decomposition study that maps candidate “moral catastrophe” axes in Sec. 2.3 into a minimal factor model (e.g., Bayesian factor analysis over a large set of moral views + future-world descriptions) and estimates independence/correlation between axes.
