**How does uncertainty about cosmology (e.g., finite vs effectively infinite universe, prevalence of alien civilisations, and what we can causally affect) quantitatively change whether bounded views become “approximately linear in practice” and therefore fussy?** — A key step claims that if the universe is vast and already value-filled, humanity’s marginal impact is small, making concave-bounded views locally linear and thus fussy. If the accessible/affectable region is smaller than assumed, or if cosmic value outside our influence is irrelevant on many views, bounded views might remain non-linear in practice, reopening space for genuinely easygoing ethics.
