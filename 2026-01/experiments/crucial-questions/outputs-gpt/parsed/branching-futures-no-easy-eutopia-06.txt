**Do influential longtermist decision-makers converge on moral-uncertainty aggregation methods that overweight upside (e.g., variance/pairwise-style normalization) or overweight downside (range-to-worst / safety-dominant), and is that convergence stable across institutions?**
   - **The branch point:** *“Upside-weighted moral uncertainty → aggressive flourishing optimization”* vs *“Downside-weighted moral uncertainty → primarily survival/safety focus”.*
   - **Paper anchor:** Section **3.5** (intertheoretic comparisons can flip recommended choices; unbounded views may loom larger under plausible methods).
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe **explicit adoption** of variance/pairwise-like frameworks in major grantmakers/labs/governance proposals and increased tolerance for controlled risk to access eutopian upside; if Branch B, we’d observe **institutionalized maximin/robust-safety rules**, “no-dystopia” constraints, and systematic deprioritization of upside-chasing projects.
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 12 months**, because funding/strategy portfolios are being set now and create path dependence in research and governance capacity.
