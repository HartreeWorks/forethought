**How accurate is the multiplicative “value as the product of many factors” model, including its independence assumptions, when tested against structured moral theories and realistic correlations among dimensions (e.g., freedom, welfare, moral reflection, institutional quality)?** — The argument for eutopian fragility leans heavily on multiplicativity and quasi-independence to make high-value outcomes rare. If key dimensions are positively correlated (or if value aggregates more additively/saturatingly), then “single-flaw ruins most value” may be much less common, making mostly-great futures less fragile than claimed.
