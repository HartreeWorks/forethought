**Are there governance mechanisms that can reliably create and sustain the paper’s assumed “serious optimisation pressure … to promote the very best outcomes *de dicto*” without being derailed by regulatory capture, illegible objectives, or enforcement failure?**  
   - **Worldview:** Governance Realist *(also bears on Alignment Pessimist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.1’s baseline distribution “conditional on there being no more serious optimisation pressure than today … to promote the very best outcomes *de dicto*,” plus the Conclusion’s claim that narrow-target eutopia might still be hit via deliberation/coordination forces.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes**, strategy becomes **build international institutions, audits, enforcement capacity, and deliberative processes to instantiate de-dicto optimisation**; if **no**, strategy becomes **prioritise robust-to-politics technical measures (e.g., containment, tripwires, resilience, and limiting irreversible lock-in) rather than ambitious “steering” governance**.
