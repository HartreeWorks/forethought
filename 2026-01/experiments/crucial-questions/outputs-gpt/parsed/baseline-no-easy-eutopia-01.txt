**Is the paper’s implied “default” distribution over post-survival futures (with no serious de dicto optimisation) empirically grounded, and what does it predict about the probability mass on mostly-great outcomes?** — The central claim that mostly-great futures are a “narrow target” depends on what futures are realistically likely absent coordinated steering, but the paper does not operationalize or estimate this distribution. If real-world dynamics (institutional evolution, markets, cultural selection, AI deployment patterns) systematically push toward high-value regions, the no-easy-eutopia conclusion could weaken substantially.
