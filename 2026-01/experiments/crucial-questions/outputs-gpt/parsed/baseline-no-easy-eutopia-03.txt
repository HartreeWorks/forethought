**Do plausible moral views actually imply a fat-tailed distribution of value-efficiency over resource uses at advanced capability levels, and how sensitive are the conclusions to alternative tail shapes (lognormal, bounded, multimodal, etc.)?** — The paper’s claim that most resource configurations waste most value on linear views relies on extreme concentration of value in rare “best uses.” If value-efficiency is not fat-tailed (or if there are many near-optimal basins), then the target may be much larger, changing whether linear/unbounded views are necessarily “fussy” in practice.
