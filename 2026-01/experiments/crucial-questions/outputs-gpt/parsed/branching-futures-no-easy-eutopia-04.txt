**Does public and elite moral opinion become more scope-sensitive about future scale (population size, expansion, long-run resource capture), or does it remain “common-sense utopia” scale-insensitive even after exposure to scale arguments?**
   - **The branch point:** *“Scale-sensitive ethics → expansion/astronomical governance prioritized”* vs *“Scale-insensitive ethics → small-but-happy futures accepted; large value left on the table under linear views”.*
   - **Paper anchor:** Section **2.3.1** (scale-insensitivity; population ethics drives huge value differences) and Section **3.2** (linear views require using most resources).
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe **measurable shifts** in surveys of policymakers/philanthropy leaders after deliberative prompts: increased willingness to fund expansion-enabling governance (space, long-term institutions) and to trade off small present gains for large future-population gains; if Branch B, we’d observe **stable preferences** that treat “solar-system utopia” as near-best and reject expansion-oriented tradeoffs even after structured reflection.
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 18–24 months**, to steer near-term agenda-setting (space policy, AI-driven growth plans, long-run institution design).
