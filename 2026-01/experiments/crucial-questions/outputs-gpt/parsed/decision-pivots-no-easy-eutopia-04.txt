**How soon, and how irreversibly, will early space settlement “capture essentially all resources that will ever be available to us,” creating lock-in of initial allocation norms?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “The initial periods of settlement and resource appropriation … will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us” (Sec. 2.3.4) and “If AI drives explosive industrial expansion, this … could … be within years or decades” (Sec. 2.3.4).  
   - **The flip:** If decisive resource capture is likely within \(\lesssim 50\) years and early allocations are hard to revise, then **prioritise near-term space/AI governance and constitutional “resource rights” design before expansion**; if capture is \(\gtrsim 200\) years away or allocations are readily renegotiable, then **prioritise slower moral reflection, institution building, and broad cooperation capacity** over urgent space-race governance.  
   - **What would answer it:** Integrated assessment combining (i) engineering/physics constraints on replication/industrial growth off-Earth, (ii) AI automation timelines for self-replicating industry, and (iii) political economy of path dependence (how often large property regimes get renegotiated once established).
