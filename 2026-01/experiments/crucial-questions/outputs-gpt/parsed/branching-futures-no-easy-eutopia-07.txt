**Is the paper’s “multiplicative fragility” model empirically a good approximation for reflective human moral judgments (many near-independent necessary dimensions), or do judgments compress to a small set of robustly dominant dimensions that make mostly-great futures comparatively common?**
   - **The branch point:** *“High-dimensional product-of-factors → eutopia extremely rare without deliberate steering”* vs *“Low-dimensional/value-compressible → ‘easy eutopia’ closer to true”.*
   - **Paper anchor:** Section **2.4** (value as product of factors) and the overall “no easy eutopia” conclusion that single flaws can erase most value.
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe in structured deliberation studies that adding new morally salient considerations (digital welfare, population ethics, diversity, suffering aversion, rights/ownership) **repeatedly and multiplicatively reduces** participants’ ratings of “how close a future is to best,” with weak substitutability; if Branch B, we’d observe **strong substitutability/override** (e.g., “happiness + freedom” dominates and absorbs most other concerns) and high stability of “mostly-great” classifications across varied prompts.
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 18–24 months**, to decide whether to build broad “moral error avoidance” capacity across many axes or to focus on a narrow set of core levers.
