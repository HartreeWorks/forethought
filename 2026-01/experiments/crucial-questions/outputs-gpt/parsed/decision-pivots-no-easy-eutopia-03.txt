**How fat-tailed is the distribution of “value per unit resource” over feasible uses of cosmic-scale resources (i.e., does a tiny fraction of configurations capture most value)?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “the distribution of value/cost … is probably sufficiently *fat-tailed* … [so] a mostly-great future is a narrow target” (Sec. 3.2), and “unless *most* available resources are configured for the *almost exactly most valuable* kind(s) of thing … most achievable value is almost certainly lost” (Sec. 3.2).  
   - **The flip:** If the top \(\le 0.1\%\) of resource uses plausibly deliver \(\ge 50\%\) of attainable value (extreme fat tail), then **precision alignment/targeting the “right” kind of value-creation** is pivotal; if instead value-efficiency is comparatively smooth (e.g., top 10% uses deliver <2× median value), then **scale/building/expansion and general welfare improvements** are robustly good.  
   - **What would answer it:** Cross-domain modeling of maximum experiential intensity and other intrinsic goods under advanced design (Sec. 3.2’s experience arguments), combined with compute-based search/upper bounds on achievable welfare per joule/bit and empirical priors from existing fat-tail measurements (interventions, consumer surplus, etc.) translated into future resource-use space.
