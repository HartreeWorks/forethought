**Is the paper’s “value is the product of many relatively independent factors” model a good approximation for real-world moral stakes, such that doing poorly on any one dimension typically destroys most value?**  
   - **Worldview:** Alignment Pessimist *(also bears on Governance Realist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.4’s multiplicative toy model and its takeaway: “a eutopian future needs to do very well on essentially every one of the issues … doing badly on any one … sufficient to lose out on most value.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (strong multiplicative fragility)**, strategy becomes **treat alignment/governance as requiring near-zero-tolerance across many failure modes; emphasise conservative, redundancy-heavy safety and preventing irreversible errors**; if **no (more additive/forgiving structure)**, strategy becomes **pursue portfolio approaches and accept some mistakes while still expecting high overall value**.
