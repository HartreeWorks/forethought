**Which intertheoretic comparison method is defensible enough to guide policy—e.g., the paper’s contrast between “extinction–best” normalisation, variance normalisation, and the pairwise approach—given that it flips whether “safety-focused” or “upside-focused” strategies dominate?**  
   - **Worldview:** Capability Accelerationist *(also relevant to Governance Realist for policy justification)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.5: different normalisations; example where methods disagree sharply on “safety-focused” vs “upside-focused” option rankings.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **methods that privilege downside avoidance dominate (e.g., extinction–best style weighting)**, strategy becomes **heavy risk minimisation and strict safety constraints even at large opportunity cost**; if **methods that legitimise upside seeking dominate (e.g., the paper’s “pairwise approach” in the example)**, strategy becomes **tolerate higher catastrophic risk for large probability mass on eutopia/upside, favouring faster capability deployment with safeguards**.
