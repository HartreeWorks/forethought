**Which intertheoretic comparison/normalisation rule is correct enough to act on—given the paper’s demonstration that it can reverse whether “upside-focused” risk-taking beats “safety-focused” downside avoidance?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “the approach to uncertainty critically matters for which option is best” and different normalisations make “upside-focused” vs “safety-focused” swap (Sec. 3.5; the comparison table/figure).  
   - **The flip:** If the correct intertheoretic comparisons give substantial effective weight to unbounded/high-upside theories (e.g., via variance normalisation or the paper’s pairwise-stake reasoning), then **prioritise upside-seeking strategies that increase chances of eutopia even with some dystopia risk**; if instead comparisons effectively normalise stakes so downside dominates (e.g., extinction–best normalisation), then **prioritise safety-focused strategies that minimise catastrophe probabilities even if they cap upside**.  
   - **What would answer it:** A formal decision-theory audit that tests candidate comparison rules against desiderata the paper highlights (e.g., avoiding dependence on “contingent fact about how big the affectable universe is,” Sec. 3.5) plus pre-registered surveys of stable moral judgments across cosmology/scale updates to see which normalisation best matches people’s cross-scale invariances.
