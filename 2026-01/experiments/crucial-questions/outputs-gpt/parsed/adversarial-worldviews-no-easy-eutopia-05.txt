**Will future societies in fact create “vast numbers of digital beings” who plausibly have moral status and could be treated as property, creating a dominant source of value-loss (or disvalue) relative to biological welfare?**  
   - **Worldview:** Digital Minds Advocate *(also appears for Governance Realist via rights/enforcement)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.3.2: “there may be vast numbers of digital beings,” potential treatment “like any other piece of software,” and that rights decisions could cause “loss of most potential value.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **yes (moral-patient digital explosion likely)**, strategy becomes **front-load research and governance for digital sentience detection, welfare standards, anti-slavery rules, and scalable rights/representation mechanisms**; if **no (few/no moral-patient digitals or easily avoidable)**, strategy becomes **deprioritise digital-rights-first frameworks and focus on other fragility dimensions (e.g., human welfare, geopolitical stability, alignment)**.
