**Which method of intertheoretic comparison under moral uncertainty is defensible enough to guide action, and how often do candidate methods flip the paper’s implied priority between “survival-focused” versus “upside/steering-focused” strategies?** — The paper shows that different normalisations (range, variance, pairwise) can reverse which prospects dominate, but it does not resolve the dispute or quantify robustness across realistic option sets. If a defensible aggregation method systematically amplifies either upside-seeking or downside-avoidance, it could substantially change the practical implication of “no easy eutopia” for what we should do now.
