**What is the probability that a “mostly-great” future occurs by default (conditional on survival and “no serious, coordinated efforts … to promote the overall best outcomes de dicto”)?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “consider a reasonable probability distribution … conditional on *Survival*, but also … *no more serious optimisation pressure than today* … To the extent that … mostly-great futures [are] very unlikely … (say, <1%), then that moral view is fussy” (Sec. 3.1).  
   - **The flip:** If \(P(\text{mostly-great} \mid \text{survival, no de dicto optimisation}) \gtrsim 10\%\), then **prioritise survival/extinction-risk reduction**; if \( \lesssim 1\%\), then **prioritise deliberate “better futures” steering (moral/gov/institutional optimisation toward near-best outcomes)**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Explicit scenario distributions from structured expert elicitation + forecasting tournaments that condition on “survival” and hold “optimisation pressure” fixed, plus calibration against historical rates of “moral catastrophe” reversal vs persistence (Sec. 2.1) under rising abundance.
