**What is the realistic likelihood that future societies create vast numbers of morally considerable digital beings, and what tractable indicators could determine their moral status and welfare range (including the prevalence of extreme suffering or “AI death”)?** — Several of the paper’s strongest “single-flaw” scenarios hinge on digital minds being both numerous and morally significant, yet this is an empirical/technical uncertainty about AI architectures and deployment incentives. If digital beings are unlikely to be conscious, or if welfare can be reliably bounded/monitored, the expected fragility from this domain could drop sharply.
