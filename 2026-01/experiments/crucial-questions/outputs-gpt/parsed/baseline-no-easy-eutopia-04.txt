**How robust is the “fussiness” result to relaxing the von Neumann–Morgenstern completeness/continuity/independence framework (e.g., incomparability, lexical priorities, deontic constraints, or non-expected-value decision rules)?** — The paper’s quantitative thresholds (eutopia ≥0.9, mostly-great ≥0.5) and many comparisons depend on representing moral views with a single cardinal vNM utility function. If many reasonable views resist such representation, the notion of “narrowness of target” may not be well-defined or may behave very differently, undermining the generality of the conclusion.
