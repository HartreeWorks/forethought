**Do major governance venues (courts, legislatures, standards bodies, major labs) move toward treating at least some advanced AI systems as having welfare-relevant constraints (auditing for suffering, limits on deletion/forced labor), or do they entrench full ownership/control norms?**
   - **The branch point:** *“Early AI-welfare governance (rights/constraints) emerges”* vs *“Property paradigm hardens; moral catastrophe risk rises”.*
   - **Paper anchor:** Section **2.3.2** (ownership, death, inequality, voting power for digital beings) and the idea that even “approved-by-everyone” worlds can hide catastrophic moral error.
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe **formal standards** (e.g., welfare audits for training/deployment, restrictions on punishment/reward shaping, retention/termination policies) and **test-case litigation/regulation** referencing AI welfare; if Branch B, we’d observe **IP/contract law moves** explicitly affirming unrestricted modification/termination and **industry norms** optimizing purely for productivity with no welfare constraints.
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 12–24 months**, because once compliance baselines and liability norms set, reversing them becomes costly.
