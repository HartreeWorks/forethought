**To what extent do agents with diverse starting values actually converge in their *endorsed* “idealized reflection” outputs when given superintelligent assistance under controlled conditions (varying meta-ethical assumptions, reflection procedures, and time/compute budgets)?** — The paper’s pessimism about WAM-convergence under antirealism and only-weak optimism under realism hinges on a largely untested empirical claim about how reflection behaves at superhuman capability. Direct evidence about convergence/divergence patterns would substantially shift the paper’s bottom-line probabilities for “mostly-great” futures via convergence rather than bargaining.
