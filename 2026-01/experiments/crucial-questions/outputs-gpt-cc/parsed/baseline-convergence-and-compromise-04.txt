**In realistic post-AGI bargaining environments, how large are the achievable gains from moral trade once strategic behavior, contract design limits, coordination costs, information asymmetries, and heterogeneous risk beliefs are modeled explicitly rather than assumed away?** — The paper relies on an intuition that superintelligence enables “iron-clad contracts” and near-frictionless positive-sum bargaining, but it does not quantify how robust this is. If frictions remain large, then partial AM-convergence may not translate into mostly-great outcomes, weakening the paper’s main optimistic pathway.
