**Which collective decision procedures are actually being implemented for AI-mediated societal choices: “reason-tracking deliberation” mechanisms or “preference/identity aggregation” mechanisms that can suppress minority-valued goods?**  
   - **The branch point:** *“Pluralist compromise with reason-sensitive institutions”* vs *“Majoritarian/identity signaling politics that bans or squeezes minority utopias”*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.5 (majority rule can ban minority-valued activities; decision procedures vary in reason-tracking vs signaling).  
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe uptake of deliberative polling/citizen assemblies with expert-AI support, adjudicative bodies using explicit justificatory standards, and stable minority-protection/legal pluralism; if Branch B, we’d observe accelerating regulation by culture-war salience, winner-take-all restrictions on novel lifestyles/minds, and “values enforcement” justified primarily by coalition signaling rather than evaluated reasons.  
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 12–18 months**, because institutional defaults set early can determine whether later moral trade is possible or whether key options are legally/memetically sealed off.
