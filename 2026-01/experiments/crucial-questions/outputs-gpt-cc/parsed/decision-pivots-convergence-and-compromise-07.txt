**How soon do “most-important decisions” become effectively locked in, relative to the timescale on which asymmetric growth (“long views win”) could shift resources toward patient/altruistic values?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “non-discounting values might not have time to win out… If the major decisions are made soon, and then persist, then there just won’t be time for this selection effect to win out.” (Section 2.3.3) and “early lock-in… when the most-important decisions are being made…” (Section 2.5).  
   - **The flip:** If lock-in time \(T_{\text{lock}}\) < ~10–30 years after transformative AI, then **strategy: prioritise urgent near-term shaping (AI governance, institutional design, pre-lock-in threat suppression) over slow cultural/selection-based approaches**; if \(T_{\text{lock}}\) > ~100–1,000 years, then **strategy: prioritise mechanisms that let patient/altruistic values compound (growth advantages, durable institutions, pluralism) rather than racing immediate lock-in fights**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Scenario analyses identifying which decisions are “reversible” under advanced tech (e.g., constitutions, expansion patterns, AI autonomy, irreversible cosmological engineering), plus technical work on the feasibility of later “constitutional resets” or value pluralism once expansion begins.
