**Are AI systems (assistants, recommender models, ideological “coaches”) measurably increasing the rate of durable, hard-to-reverse belief lock-in via highly persuasive or self-sealing memes?**  
   - **The branch point:** *“Reflection capacity increases without memetic blockers”* vs *“Epistemic black holes become a dominant blocker/lock-in channel”*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.5 (memetically potent false views; epistemic black holes) and 2.3.1 (advisor choice and constrained reflection).  
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe that exposure to AI-persuasion tools does not increase long-run polarization/irreversibility (e.g., beliefs remain revisable under counter-evidence), and platforms can robustly dampen self-sealing content; if Branch B, we’d observe rising “irreversible conversion” signatures (sharp, persistent belief shifts resistant to counterargument), growth of self-insulating communities driven by AI content, and measurable increases in susceptibility to specific meme clusters after brief exposure.  
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 6–18 months**, because memetic lock-in can compound quickly and may preempt later attempts at convergence, trade, or governance reform.
