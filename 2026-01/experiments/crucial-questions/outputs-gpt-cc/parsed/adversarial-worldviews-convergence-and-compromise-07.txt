**Are digital minds likely to be created at massive scale in ways that make “bads cheap” (including via threatened or executed suffering), such that the paper’s trade-based optimism is swamped by digital welfare catastrophe risk?**  
   - **Worldview:** Digital Minds Advocate *(also salient to Alignment Pessimist and Governance Realist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** §3.2 uses digital welfare as a central example of gains from moral trade; §3.3–§3.4 emphasize that if bads weigh heavily or are cheap to create, even small executed threats can erase most value; §2.2.2 flags we may “design new kinds of beings… [who] never complain” yet may be treated badly.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **digital bads are cheap/likely at scale**, strategy becomes **treat digital welfare safeguards and anti-threat commitments as top-tier (potentially overriding) priorities**; if **digital minds are rare or easy to keep well-off**, strategy becomes **lean more on moral trade/compromise to allocate resources across value blocs rather than making digital-rights enforcement the central axis**.
