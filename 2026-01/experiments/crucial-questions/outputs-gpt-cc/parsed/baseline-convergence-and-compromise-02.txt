**How often would powerful actors choose *not* to learn, believe, or internalize conclusions from moral reflection/advice when those conclusions predictably conflict with their interests or identities (i.e., “motivational avoidance” of moral truth)?** — A central step in the paper’s argument is that even if correct moral beliefs are available (especially on realism), they may fail to motivate or may be strategically avoided. If avoidance is rare (or preventable), WAM-convergence becomes much more plausible; if it is common, many optimistic governance-by-advice stories collapse.
