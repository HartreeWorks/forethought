**How concentrated will post‑AGI power be (effective number of decisive actors), and does it fall below the level where partial AM‑convergence plus trade is realistically available?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “concentration of power… becomes less likely that the correct moral views are represented… and therefore less likely that we get to a mostly-great future via trade and compromise.” (Section 3.5)  
   - **The flip:** If effective decisive-actor count \(N_{\text{eff}}\) < ~10–100, then **strategy: prioritise interventions aimed at a small set of pivotal actors (elite governance, targeted alignment/control, preventing dictatorship capture)**; if \(N_{\text{eff}}\) > ~1,000+, then **strategy: prioritise scalable institutions for bargaining, representation, and anti-threat norms (since many views will have real bargaining weight)**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Forecasts from industrial-organisation/political-economy models of compute and AI deployment concentration; empirical tracking of frontier model ownership, inference chokepoints, and military/policy capture pathways under plausible AGI timelines.
