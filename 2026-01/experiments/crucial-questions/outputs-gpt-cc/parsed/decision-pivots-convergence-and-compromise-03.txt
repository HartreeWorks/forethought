**How close to “frictionless” will moral trade actually be—i.e., can superintelligence deliver enforceable, low-transaction-cost agreements robust enough to realise most available gains from trade?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts… transaction costs would generally be extremely small relative to the gains.” (Section 3.1) and “The extent to which the hypothetical gains from frictionless trade are actually realised.” (Section 3.2)  
   - **The flip:** If enforceability/low-cost reliability \(r\) > ~0.9 across major actor types, then **strategy: invest in formal ‘moral trade’ infrastructure (contracting, constitutional mechanisms, dispute resolution) rather than trying to enforce one value set**; if \(r\) < ~0.5, then **strategy: shift toward centralised governance/alignment of the dominant decision system, because bargaining won’t scale safely**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Adversarial audits of “AI-enabled contracting” (formal verification + cryptographic commitment + automated enforcement) under realistic multi-agent threat models; historical-analogy modelling of enforcement failure rates under extreme capability asymmetries.
