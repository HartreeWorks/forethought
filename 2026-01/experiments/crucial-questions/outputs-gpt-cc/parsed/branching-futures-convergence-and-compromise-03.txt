**Will “iron-clad” contracting and verification for high-stakes AI-to-AI and polity-to-polity agreements become practically deployable at the margin where cosmic-scale bargaining would matter?**  
   - **The branch point:** *“Low-friction moral trade feasible (contracts + low transaction costs)”* vs *“Trade mostly theoretical (commitment/verification too weak or too costly)”*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 3.1–3.2 (trade needs trust/low transaction costs; superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts).  
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe rapid adoption of formally verified agent protocols, escrow/commitment primitives, and auditable “constitution compliance” in real financial/cyber settings with minimal dispute rates; if Branch B, we’d observe repeated failures of agent commitments under distribution shift, frequent renegotiation/defection, and regulators/firms avoiding fully autonomous contracting due to irreducible exploitability.  
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 18–24 months**, because the feasibility of robust bargaining institutions determines whether to invest primarily in “trade-enabling infrastructure” versus alternative governance/constraint strategies.
