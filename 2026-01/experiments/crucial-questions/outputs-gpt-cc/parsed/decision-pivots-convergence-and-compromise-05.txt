**Which side of the paper’s axiological danger zone are we in: are bads “separately aggregated” and/or effectively unbounded/overweight relative to goods such that small threat rates make futures net-negative (or “worse than extinction”)?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “On many views, bads weigh more heavily than goods… even if only a small fraction of resources are devoted to executed threats, most of the value of the future could be lost… [trade scenarios] could… even render them worse than extinction.” (Sections 3.3, 6) and the case split in 3.4.  
   - **The flip:** If the correct/decision-relevant axiology implies (separate aggregation or unbounded downside or heavy bad-weighting) such that the “critical threat rate” \(t^\*\) < ~0.1%, then **strategy: treat s-risk/threat suppression as the top priority even if it slows flourishing/expansion**; if \(t^\*\) > ~5–10%, then **strategy: focus on flourishing-maximisation via institutions for compromise and broad value satisfaction**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Explicit moral-uncertainty modelling with sensitivity to boundedness and aggregation rules, paired with empirical “moral parliament” elicitation of where reflective stakeholders place weight on separate aggregation/lexical bads; decision analyses computing \(t^\*\) under candidate axiologies.
