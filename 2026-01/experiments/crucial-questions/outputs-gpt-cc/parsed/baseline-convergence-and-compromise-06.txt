**What mechanisms determine whether “early lock-in” happens before reflection and bargaining mature, and what empirical indicators can forecast the timing of irreversible commitments relative to moral deliberation capacity?** — Many arguments assume “reasonably good conditions” without specifying how often conditions allow later correction rather than path dependence. If lock-in typically precedes broad reflection/trade, then both WAM-convergence and compromise routes become far less relevant, shifting recommended action toward early governance and constraint-setting.
