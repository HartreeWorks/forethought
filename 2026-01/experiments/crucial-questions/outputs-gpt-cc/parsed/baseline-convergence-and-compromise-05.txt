**How common and how resource-intensive are “value-destroying threats” at equilibrium in multi-agent settings with commitment capabilities, and what institutional designs (if any) are stable against them without creating worse forms of lock-in or coercion?** — The paper flags threats as potentially dominating expected value but acknowledges limited analysis and literature. If threats are rare or containable, trade-based optimism strengthens; if they are hard to prevent or are equilibrium behavior, then even small threat probabilities could drive the paper’s forecast toward net-negative futures.
