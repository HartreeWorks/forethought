**What is the expected share of future resources that end up devoted to *executed* value-destroying threats in multi-party bargaining, and how does that vary with multipolarity and enforcement norms?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “even small risks of executed threats can easily eat into the expected value…” and “If… only a small fraction of resources are devoted to executed threats, most of the value of the future could be lost.” (Section 3.3)  
   - **The flip:** If executed-threat resource share \(t\) > ~0.1–1% (or even lower on some axiologies), then **strategy: prioritise threat prevention above ‘more trade’ (including reducing multipolar rivalry, building strong anti-extortion norms/commitments, and designing institutions to make threats non-credible)**; if \(t\) < ~0.01%, then **strategy: prioritise expanding compromise/trade capacity because it dominates expected value**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Game-theoretic + agent-based simulations calibrated on real-world extortion/blackmail dynamics; “red-team” experiments with AI agents negotiating under different commitment/enforcement regimes to measure emergent extortion equilibria.
