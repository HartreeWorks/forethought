**What is the real distribution (not just possibility) of future preference types regarding diminishing returns—specifically, how prevalent are approximately linear-in-resources objectives (altruistic or not) among the agents likely to control most resources in post-AGI worlds?** — The trade/compromise story’s promise and limits depend heavily on whether the future is dominated by easily-satiable agents versus linear maximizers. If linear objectives are widespread, gains from compromise may be small and conflict/threat incentives larger; if rare, small “moral minorities” could buy near-best outcomes cheaply.
