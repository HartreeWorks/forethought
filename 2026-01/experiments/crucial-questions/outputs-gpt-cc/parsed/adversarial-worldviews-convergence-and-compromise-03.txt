**Can value-destroying “executed threats” be prevented by a legal/institutional regime that is both (i) effective and (ii) “mutually agreeable and stable” among competing value blocs?**  
   - **Worldview:** Governance Realist *(also salient to Digital Minds Advocate and Alignment Pessimist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** §3.3–§3.4: even small fractions of resources spent on executed threats can wipe out expected value; paper says it’s “not obvious” that a reliable anti-threat legal system would be agreeable/stable.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **preventable**, strategy becomes **invest heavily in enforceable anti-extortion norms/law, credible monitoring, and threat-deterrence institutions**; if **not preventable**, strategy becomes **minimize interaction surfaces for extortion (segmentation, robust deterrence, or reducing stake size/commitment capacity), possibly shifting priority back toward preventing AGI arrival or preventing value pluralism from becoming strategically interactable**.
