**Will post-AGI abundance primarily amplify altruistic spending (as a diminishing-returns effect) or instead amplify non-altruistic “linear-in-resources” preferences (collector/positional/shrine-building), thereby shrinking the feasible gains from compromise?**  
   - **Worldview:** Capability Accelerationist *(also salient to Governance Realist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** §2.3.2 argues abundance shifts marginal resources toward preferences with slow diminishing returns, but explicitly notes these may be non-altruistic and cites weak billionaire philanthropy as evidence; §3.2 warns linear views may be hard to trade/compromise with.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If **abundance increases altruistic share**, strategy becomes **accelerate capability/wealth creation while building trade institutions**; if **abundance mostly empowers non-altruistic linear preferences**, strategy becomes **prioritize early governance/value-shaping/constraint-setting before actors become effectively insatiable and uncompromising**.
