**Will AI-augmented moral reflection cause substantial convergence in *end-state* values across people with very different starting ethical intuitions?**  
   - **The branch point:** *“WAM-convergence plausible”* vs *“Reflection increases divergence (antirealist-style free-parameter drift)”*  
   - **Paper anchor:** Section 2.2.1 (random-walk divergence with more reflection) and 2.3.1–2.4 (superintelligence helps reasoning but may not yield convergence; realism vs antirealism implications).  
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we’d observe multi-lab replication where diverse participants using strong AI deliberation tools (with transparency/critique) converge on similar population-ethics/valuation tradeoffs and keep those views over months; if Branch B, we’d observe widened dispersion (or clustering by initial ideology/tool choice) after deliberation, with low cross-cluster agreement on “fussy” choices (digital minds, population size, extreme welfare tradeoffs).  
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 12–18 months**, to decide whether to prioritize “better reflection pipelines” vs “robust pluralist bargaining/governance” as the main route to good futures.
