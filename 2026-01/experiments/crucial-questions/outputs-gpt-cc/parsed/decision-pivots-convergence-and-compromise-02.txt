**At the key bargaining/lock‑in moment, what fraction of resources/power will be controlled by agents who partially AM‑converge to the correct moral view and are willing to spend “most of the resources they control” on it?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “some meaningful fraction… would converge on the correct moral view and would be motivated to use most of the resources they control towards promoting the good… not less than (say) one in a million people.” (Section 3)  
   - **The flip:** If the “correct-view” coalition’s initial resource share \(s\) > ~1–5%, then **strategy: build institutions for moral trade/compromise to amplify that share into near-best outcomes**; if \(s\) < ~0.1–1%, then **strategy: prioritise preventing power concentration + targeted influence over pivotal power-holders (or technical control leverage), because trade from a tiny base won’t reach ‘mostly-great’**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Forecasting models of post‑AGI power distribution (compute/capital/military/AI ownership) combined with empirical estimates of “scope-sensitive altruistic” prevalence after strong AI-mediated reflection experiments.
