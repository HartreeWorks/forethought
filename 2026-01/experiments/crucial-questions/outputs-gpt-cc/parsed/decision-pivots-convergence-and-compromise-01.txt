**What is the probability that, under “reasonably good conditions,” post‑AGI society achieves widespread, accurate, *motivational* convergence on promoting the good *de dicto* (WAM‑convergence)?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “We’ll here assume that, given WAM-convergence, we will reach a mostly-great future… [but] we give our main argument against expecting WAM-convergence even under reasonably good conditions.” (Sections 2, 2.4)  
   - **The flip:** If \(P(\text{WAM} \mid \text{good conditions})\) > ~0.5, then **prioritise ensuring ‘good conditions’ (survival + avoid lock‑in/blockers) and letting reflection do the rest**; if < ~0.5, then **prioritise pluralistic governance/compromise mechanisms (trade, institutions, threat prevention) because convergence won’t rescue us**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Large-scale empirical “reflection divergence” studies using heterogeneous populations + AI-assisted deliberation (varying starting points and idealisation rules), plus formal models predicting convergence rates under different meta-ethical assumptions.
