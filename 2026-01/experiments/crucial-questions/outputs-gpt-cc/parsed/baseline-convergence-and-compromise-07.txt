**How sensitive are the paper’s conclusions to the implicit “narrow target” premise—i.e., what is the best-supported estimate of the measure/robustness of high-value futures under plausible models of value, feasibility constraints, and optimization errors?** — The entire framing (no easy eutopia, need for convergence or compromise) depends on high-value futures being both rare and fragile. If the target is wider—because many different value realizations are “good enough,” or because mistakes are corrigible—then the expected value of the future and the urgency of the paper’s proposed mechanisms change substantially.
