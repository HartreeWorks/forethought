**What fraction of frontier-relevant progress over the last ~2–3 years has come from “compute-light” routes (conceptual/theoretical insights, scaffolding, data/elicitation improvements, evaluation innovations) versus compute-heavy empirical search, and is that fraction increasing with better automation?**
   - **The branch point:** *“Strongest-link route exists (some paths not compute-bottlenecked) → SIE can route around compute”* vs *“All major routes are compute-bound → CES-style bottleneck dominates.”*
   - **Paper anchor:** Tests the paper’s “multiple routes/strongest-link” argument that compute bottlenecks only block SIE if **all** routes are compute-bottlenecked.
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, postmortems/ablations of major gains increasingly attribute progress to non-scaling experiments (or to improvements transferable without large new runs). If Branch B, progress attribution concentrates on large-run empirical iteration, with compute-light ideas rarely surviving contact with scaling.
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Within 12–24 months**, because this affects whether strategy should emphasize compute governance vs. monitoring/steering non-compute progress channels (data, scaffolds, evals).
