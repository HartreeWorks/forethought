**If compute bottlenecks “don’t slow an SIE until its late stages,” do compute-centric governance tools (chip export controls, datacenter licensing, training-run reporting) meaningfully reduce SIE risk, or do they mainly push acceleration into software-only, harder-to-monitor channels and worsen coordination failures?**  
   - **Worldview:** Governance Realist *(also overlaps Capability Accelerationist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** The paper’s core conclusion that compute bottlenecks probably won’t bind early, plus its framing that an SIE could proceed “without needing more hardware.”  
   - **Strategic implications:** If answered “compute governance still meaningfully reduces risk,” strategy becomes “double down on international compute monitoring/enforcement and capacity-building”; if answered “it mostly displaces effort into software secrecy,” strategy becomes “shift emphasis toward algorithmic progress surveillance, lab auditing, information-security governance, and coordination mechanisms beyond compute controls.”
