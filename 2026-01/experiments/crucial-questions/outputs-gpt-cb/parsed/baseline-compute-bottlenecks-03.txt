**To what extent does algorithmic progress actually increase the number of informative experiments per unit of fixed hardware when the goal is improving near-frontier capability rather than running more small experiments?** — The paper argues that “compute” is not fixed because efficiency gains let you run more experiments, and that near-frontier experiments may not be necessary, but this is an empirical claim about how progress is generated. If near-frontier scaling experiments are disproportionately required for major capability gains, then fixed hardware could impose a much tighter constraint than the paper suggests.
