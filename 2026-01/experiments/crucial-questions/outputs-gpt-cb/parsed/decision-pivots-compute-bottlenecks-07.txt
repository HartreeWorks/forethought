**Is there at least one “compute-light” route to major capability gains (the paper’s “strongest link” framing) whose effective ρ is near 0 and whose returns are sufficient to reach superintelligence without near-frontier scaling?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “*alternative frame… multiple possible routes… you just need one of them to work… The compute bottleneck objection only works if all of these routes are bottlenecked by compute.*”  
   - **The flip:** If **≥1 route** (e.g., scaffolding/tool-use, data flywheels, distillation/compression, mechanistic insights) has **effective ρ ≥ ~−0.1** *and* demonstrated strong returns, then **strategy A: assume compute bottlenecks won’t reliably prevent an SIE and prioritize alignment + broad governance**; if **all routes** empirically show **ρ ≤ ~−0.3** or weak returns, then **strategy B: focus on compute as the primary choke point (hardware/export controls, scheduling, monitoring)**.  
   - **What would answer it:** A route-by-route empirical portfolio evaluation: define candidate “compute-light” pathways, run constrained-compute research programs for each, and estimate their marginal capability gains per unit cognitive labor at constant compute—then take the max (strongest-link) rather than an average.
