**What is the real-world scaling relationship between experiment count/quality and marginal algorithmic progress (i.e., do “ideas get harder” in a way that makes progress sublinear even with massive cognitive labor)?** — The compute-bottleneck objection relies on increasing difficulty and diminishing returns as low-hanging fruit is exhausted, while the paper implies abundant cognition can keep idea generation productive. Measuring how returns to additional experiments and researcher-hours change with proximity to the frontier would determine whether acceleration persists or predictably stalls.
