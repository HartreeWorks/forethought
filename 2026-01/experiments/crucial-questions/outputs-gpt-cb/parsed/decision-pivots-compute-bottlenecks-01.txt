**What is the effective CES complementarity parameter ρ for AI R&D once cognitive labor is scaled up by ≥1–3 OOM (i.e., “millions of AGIs”) while compute is held fixed?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “*my views… leave me thinking that, most likely, −0.2<ρ<0*” and “*if today you poured an unlimited supply… the pace… would increase by a factor of ∼30* (for ρ=−0.2).”  
   - **The flip:** If **ρ < −0.2** (early ceiling ≲30×), then **strategy A: treat compute as the binding constraint and prioritize compute governance / hardware-access controls**; if **ρ ≥ −0.2** (ceiling high enough not to bind early), then **strategy B: treat rapid software-only acceleration as plausible and prioritize fast alignment + crisis governance for short timelines**.  
   - **What would answer it:** A controlled “fixed-compute R&D scaling” study where many autonomous research agents (human+AI, then AI-only) pursue algorithmic improvements under a constant compute budget, estimating how progress speed scales with added cognitive labor (and fitting ρ, allowing non-CES alternatives).
