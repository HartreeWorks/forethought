**Given the paper’s SIE definition (“\(\ge 5\) OOM increase in effective training compute in <1 year without more hardware”) and its claim that “society wouldn’t have time to prepare,” can alignment/control techniques realistically improve and be deployed on comparable timescales, or will deceptive/inner-misaligned systems dominate by default?**  
   - **Worldview:** Alignment Pessimist *(overlaps Governance Realist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** The paper’s explicit fast-timeline framing (“few months or years,” “<1 year” for \(\ge 5\) OOM) and conclusion that compute bottlenecks likely “don’t bite” until later stages.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If answered “alignment can keep pace,” strategy becomes “lean into fast capability progress with tight evaluation and controlled deployment”; if answered “alignment cannot keep pace,” strategy becomes “prioritise aggressive slowing/containment, hard access controls, and governance actions that reduce the probability of entering a fast SIE regime at all.”
