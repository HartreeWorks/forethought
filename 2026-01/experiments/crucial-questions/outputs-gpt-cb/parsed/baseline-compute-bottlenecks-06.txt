**What are the binding non-compute constraints during automated AI R&D (data access/rights, evaluation and feedback latency, engineering throughput, memory/IO bottlenecks, coordination and verification costs), and do they effectively reintroduce a “fixed factor” analogous to compute?** — The paper focuses on compute versus cognition, but an SIE could be limited by other scarce inputs that do not scale with more automated researchers. If these constraints dominate, then increasing cognitive labor may not translate into proportionally faster progress even when GPU compute is ample or more substitutable than assumed.
