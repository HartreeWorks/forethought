**How large is the multiplicative speedup from “smarter and faster” AI researchers (not just more copies) on algorithmic progress, once bottlenecked experiments are accounted for?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “*economic estimates don’t include labourers becoming smarter or thinking faster… moving… to top employee… increase… by a factor of 6 (median)… don’t speak to… thinking speed increasing*.”  
   - **The flip:** If **per-generation researcher-quality+thinking-speed gains produce ≥~10× R&D progress speedup** even under fixed experiment throughput, then **strategy A: treat takeoff as potentially extremely fast and prioritize emergency alignment and hard-stop governance options**; if **≤~2–3×**, then **strategy B: expect compute/experiment cadence to dominate and prioritize compute governance + slower-burn alignment**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Head-to-head trials where matched teams (or agent ensembles) with different capability levels/clock speeds are given the same fixed experiment budget and identical tool access, measuring realized algorithmic progress and isolating the contribution of pure cognition (planning, theory, debugging, architecture search) vs experiments.
