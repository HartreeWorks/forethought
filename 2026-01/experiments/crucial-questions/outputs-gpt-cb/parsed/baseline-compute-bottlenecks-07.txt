**Does the CES production-function mapping (Y as “pace of software progress,” K as compute, L as cognitive labor) accurately represent the dynamics of AI R&D, or do alternative process models (e.g., search over discrete algorithmic breakthroughs, parallel portfolio effects, winner-take-most selection) yield qualitatively different predictions about bottlenecks and takeoff speed?** — The paper critiques parameter choices but largely accepts the CES framing as a reference point, despite acknowledging heroic extrapolation and mismatched domains. If CES is the wrong functional form for R&D, then conclusions derived from “max speed” ceilings and substitutability parameters may be misleading, changing how we should forecast and respond to potential SIE scenarios.
