**How quickly does AI R&D “reconfigure” so that short-run complementarity (low ρ) rises toward long-run ρ≈0 when cognitive labor suddenly becomes abundant?**  
   - **Paper anchor:** “*in the longer run we invent new production processes… and so ρ is higher… that reconfiguration could be very quick with fast-thinking AGIs… days or weeks*.”  
   - **The flip:** If **reconfiguration time τ ≤ ~1–2 months**, then **strategy A: assume bottlenecks won’t buy meaningful time and prioritize immediate, takeoff-speed alignment/governance**; if **τ ≥ ~1–2 years**, then **strategy B: expect a prolonged compute-bottleneck plateau and prioritize medium-term institution-building / monitoring over emergency measures**.  
   - **What would answer it:** Time-to-adaptation evidence from “shock” deployments (sudden large increases in agentic R&D labor) measuring how fast labs change workflows to exploit parallelism (e.g., automated experiment design, eval pipelines, codebase refactors) and how the marginal returns to added agents evolve week by week.
