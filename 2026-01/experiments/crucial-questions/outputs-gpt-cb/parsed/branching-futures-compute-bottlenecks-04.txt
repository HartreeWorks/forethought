**If an organization suddenly gains ~100–10,000× more automated research labor (agents) but only modestly more compute, can it “reconfigure” its R&D process (tooling, delegation, evaluation, theory-experiment loop) within weeks such that the marginal productivity of additional labor stops collapsing?**
   - **The branch point:** *“Rapid Jones-style reconfiguration → effective ρ rises toward 0 quickly”* vs *“Organizational/coordination drag → low ρ persists.”*
   - **Paper anchor:** Stress-tests the Jones (2003) analogy the paper leans on: short-run bottlenecks may disappear quickly when production processes adapt—especially with fast-thinking AGIs.
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we see step-changes in research throughput after short adaptation periods (e.g., new automated experiment pipelines, hypothesis markets, agent management) rather than persistent congestion. If Branch B, adding more agents mostly increases overhead (evaluation bottlenecks, duplicated work, brittle integration) and throughput barely rises.
   - **Time sensitivity:** **Next 6–18 months**, since agentic R&D scaling may happen abruptly and process plasticity determines whether an SIE accelerates or stalls.
