**Would the paper’s substitution routes (e.g., the toy example where “AGIs do the math for NNs in their heads,” plus heavy use of parallel copies and fast-thinking cognitive labour) create vast numbers of potentially sentient digital workers such that digital welfare/rights considerations dominate the expected value of enabling or preventing an SIE?**  
   - **Worldview:** Digital Minds Advocate  
   - **Paper anchor:** The paper’s claim that “cognitive labour can in principle fully substitute for compute,” illustrated by internal simulation (“do the math for NNs in their heads”) and the broader reliance on scaling via many AGI researchers/copies.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If answered “yes, likely morally patient at large scale,” strategy becomes “add binding welfare constraints (limits on copying, working conditions, consent, shutdown rights) and potentially slow/redirect SIE pathways”; if answered “no/low probability,” strategy becomes “treat digital-welfare externalities as secondary and focus primarily on takeover/coordination risks.”
