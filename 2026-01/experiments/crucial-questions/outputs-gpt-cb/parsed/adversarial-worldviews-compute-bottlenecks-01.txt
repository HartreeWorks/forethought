**What is the effective CES substitutability parameter \( \rho \) between compute \(K\) and AI cognitive labour \(L\) specifically for AI R&D *after OAI* across 1–5 orders of magnitude increases in \(L\), given the paper’s claim that “most likely, \(-0.2<\rho<0\)” and that \(\rho\) might be near Cobb–Douglas (\(\rho=0\))?**  
   - **Worldview:** Governance Realist *(also overlaps Alignment Pessimist & Capability Accelerationist)*  
   - **Paper anchor:** “This all leaves me thinking that, most likely, \( -0.2<\rho<0\)” and the “max speed” table/graphs translating \(\rho\) into ceilings on progress speed with fixed compute.  
   - **Strategic implications:** If answered \(\rho \le -0.3\) (hard/early bottleneck), strategy becomes “prioritise compute governance and hardware choke-points, accept slower takeoff”; if answered \(\rho \approx 0\) (weak bottleneck), strategy becomes “treat rapid SIE as plausible, prioritise pre-deployment controls, monitoring, and fast alignment/containment planning.”
