**How does ρ change endogenously as AI R&D processes are reorganized by fast, abundant automated researchers (i.e., is there rapid “Jones-style” adaptation that pushes ρ toward 0 on short timescales)?** — A central counterargument is that complementarities observed in the short run may dissolve as methods and pipelines reconfigure, potentially within days or weeks under AI automation. If reconfiguration is slow or limited, then short-run bottlenecks could dominate exactly during the period when the paper expects early-stage acceleration.
