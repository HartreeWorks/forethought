**What is the empirically correct elasticity of substitution (ρ) between “cognitive labor” and compute specifically within frontier AI R&D, across large changes in L/K rather than the ~2× variation seen in most economic estimates?** — The paper’s core claim is that economy-wide ρ estimates are a weak guide and that AI R&D likely has higher substitutability (ρ closer to 0), but it provides no direct measurement in the relevant domain. If AI-R&D-specific ρ is actually strongly negative, the “max speed” ceiling could be low enough to substantially blunt or prevent an SIE.
