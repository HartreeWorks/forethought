  "reasoning": "This targets a key hinge in the paper\u2019s Section 3.2 argument: whether fat-tailed value-efficiency implies an extremely narrow near-optimal set such that missing it forfeits most attainable value on linear views. If resolved either way, it would substantially change recommended posture toward rapid expansion vs. careful search/steering, so cruciality is high and the decision hook is explicit. It is strongly paper-specific because it interrogates a particular inferential step (fat tails \u2192 \u2018most resources must be almost exactly optimal\u2019). Tractability is moderate-low: we can make analytic progress via formal models (tail-index sensitivity, near-optimal set measure, robustness across plausible distributions and value functions) and comparisons to known fat-tailed domains, but decisive empirical confirmation about far-future value-efficiency is unlikely. Clarity is decent but not perfect because thresholds like \u201cstrong enough,\u201d \u201cmost,\u201d and \u201calmost exactly\u201d need operationalisation (e.g., defining what fraction of optimum counts as \u2018near\u2019, and what value share constitutes \u2018mostly-great\u2019 under uncertainty). Minimal dead weight.",
