  "reasoning": "The question targets a central load-bearing move in the paper (Section 2.4\u2019s multiplicative/fragility model) and, if resolved, would materially affect whether one should pursue near-zero-tolerance, redundancy-heavy \u201cget everything right\u201d strategies versus more portfolio/additive approaches\u2014so cruciality and decision_hook are high. It is strongly paper-specific because it directly interrogates the paper\u2019s toy model and its key takeaway about narrow eutopian targets. However, tractability is only moderate: \u2018real-world moral stakes\u2019 and \u2018relatively independent factors\u2019 are hard to operationalise, and evidence would likely be indirect (conceptual analysis of plausible moral theories, sensitivity analyses, historical case studies of moral catastrophes, modeling correlations/aggregation forms), making definitive resolution unlikely in 1\u20135 years. Clarity is decent but not perfect because it\u2019s ambiguous what counts as a \u201cgood approximation\u201d and what distribution over futures/moral views is assumed. Little dead weight: the context, anchor, and implications mostly sharpen the research aim rather than distract.",
