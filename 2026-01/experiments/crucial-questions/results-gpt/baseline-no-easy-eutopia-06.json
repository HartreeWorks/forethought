  "reasoning": "This targets a load-bearing step in the paper\u2019s argument: that many bounded views become effectively linear (hence fussy) because humanity\u2019s marginal contribution is tiny relative to an enormous, already value-filled cosmos. If that step fails under plausible cosmological uncertainty (smaller affectable region, fewer/value-irrelevant aliens, different causal horizons), it could materially weaken the paper\u2019s \u2018most plausible views are fussy\u2019 conclusion and reopen \u2018easygoing\u2019 space\u2014though other routes to fussiness (multiplicative fragility, resource-use exactingness, bads sensitivity) would still apply, so it\u2019s not a total strategic flip. It is highly paper-specific and reasonably clear, but it bundles several cosmological variables and requires specifying priors plus a concrete model of concavity/local-linearity. It\u2019s moderately tractable via formal sensitivity analysis and scenario modeling (less so via near-term empirical resolution of cosmology/alien prevalence). The question explicitly gestures at the decision relevance (whether bounded views stay non-linear/easygoing vs become fussy), though it doesn\u2019t fully spell out downstream strategy changes beyond the ethics-metatheory implication.",
