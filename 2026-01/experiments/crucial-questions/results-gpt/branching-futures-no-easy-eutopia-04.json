  "reasoning": "The question targets a real strategic fork for the paper\u2019s worldview: if elites remain scale-insensitive even after deliberation, then advocacy for expansion/astronomical-governance as a route to \u2018mostly-great\u2019 futures (especially under linear views) looks much less promising, pushing effort toward other steering/compromise mechanisms; if they become scope-sensitive, expansion-enabling governance and long-run institution building gain priority. It is reasonably paper-specific (directly probing the paper\u2019s scale-insensitivity and linear-view implications), though versions of it also arise in broader longtermism/population-ethics debates. It\u2019s fairly tractable via deliberative survey experiments and elite/policymaker studies with pre/post measures and behavioral proxies (funding/prioritization choices), though translating prompt-induced shifts into durable real-world policy behavior is harder. Clarity is good but not perfect because \u2018scope-sensitive\u2019 and \u2018exposure to scale arguments\u2019 need sharper operational definitions and success criteria. The decision hook is explicit with branch points and observable indicators. Minimal dead weight: most of the text tightens scope and specifies measurements and timelines.",
