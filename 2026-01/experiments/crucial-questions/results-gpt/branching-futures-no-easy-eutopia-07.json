  "reasoning": "Cruciality is high because the answer plausibly flips the paper\u2019s key strategic implication (broad, many-axis \u201cmoral error avoidance/steering\u201d vs focusing on a few core levers), though it wouldn\u2019t fully settle \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 because other arguments (fat tails, boundedness/aggregation issues, moral uncertainty) could still generate fussiness. Paper-specificity is high: it directly targets Section 2.4\u2019s product-of-factors fragility model and the paper\u2019s central \u2018eutopia is rare without steering\u2019 conclusion. Tractability is moderate: deliberation/elicitation studies, conjoint designs, and robustness checks across prompts could generate evidence, but mapping \u2018reflective moral judgment\u2019 and \u2018near-independence/multiplicativity\u2019 to clean measurable constructs is hard and results may be sensitive to framing, population, and deliberation quality. Clarity is decent but not airtight: key terms (reflective, multiplicative, substitutability, \u201cmostly-great\u201d) need operational definitions and a quantitative criterion for \u201cproduct-like\u201d vs \u201ccompressed\u201d aggregation. Decision hook is very strong and explicitly bifurcated. Dead weight is low: the bullets mostly add operational indicators and link to the paper rather than fluff. Overall is strong given importance and specificity, discounted mainly for operational/measurement ambiguity and medium empirical difficulty.",
