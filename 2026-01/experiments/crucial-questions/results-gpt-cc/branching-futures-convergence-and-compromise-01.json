  "reasoning": "This targets a central fork in the paper: whether improved (AI-assisted) reflection tends to produce WAM-convergence versus increased divergence, which would substantially shift emphasis between \u201creflection pipelines\u201d and \u201cpluralist bargaining/governance\u201d (high cruciality, strong decision hook). It is closely anchored to the paper\u2019s specific arguments (random-walk divergence; superintelligence; realism vs antirealism), though a similar question could be asked in adjacent moral-psychology / AI-deliberation contexts (paper-specificity not maximal). It is moderately tractable: multi-lab longitudinal deliberation studies with AI tools can measure convergence/dispersion, stability over time, and dependence on tool choice; however, external validity to post-AGI \u201cend-state values,\u201d sensitivity to prompt/tool design, and defining the relevant outcome space (\u201cfussy\u201d axiological parameters) limit how definitive results can be in 12\u201318 months. The question is mostly clear, but \u201csubstantial,\u201d \u201cend-state values,\u201d and what counts as \u2018the same\u2019 value theory/tradeoff profile remain non-trivial ambiguities. Little dead weight: the branch structure and indicators mostly sharpen operationalization rather than padding.",
