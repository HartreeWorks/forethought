  "reasoning": "Crucial because the paper\u2019s optimism about reaching mostly-great futures via partial AM-convergence + moral trade depends heavily on whether high-trust, low-transaction-cost bargaining is feasible; a definitive \u201cno\u201d would shift emphasis toward coercion-resistant governance, power-distribution, and conflict-limitation rather than institution-building for trade. Highly paper-specific: it directly targets the \u00a73.1 \u2018superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts\u2019 premise rather than generic AI governance. Moderately tractable: parts can be operationalised via research on verifiable commitment, mechanism design, auditing/verification tech, cryptographic/fault-tolerant enforcement, and historical analogues of contract enforceability under extreme capability, but the \u2018post-AGI\u2019 setting makes direct empirical resolution hard and pushes this toward scenario analysis. Clarity is decent but key terms (\u2018iron-clad\u2019, \u2018post-AGI societies\u2019, \u2018large-scale\u2019, \u2018power-holders\u2019, and what counts as \u2018enable moral trade\u2019) leave nontrivial ambiguity about success criteria and threat models. Decision hook is explicit with a clear strategy flip. Low dead weight: the added context is mostly functional (worldview, anchor, implications) rather than fluff.",
