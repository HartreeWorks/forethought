You are identifying crucial open questions by treating this paper as describing a trajectory through possibility space. Many crucial considerations emerge at branch points—places where small differences in conditions lead to qualitatively different futures.

## Your task

Read the paper. Then:
1. Map the trajectory it describes or implies
2. Identify the branch points where futures diverge
3. Generate questions about what determines which branch we end up on

## Process

### Step 1: Extract the trajectory
Summarise the paper's causal story:
- What actors, mechanisms, and dynamics does it describe?
- What future does it (implicitly or explicitly) predict or aim for?
- What interventions or strategies does it recommend?

### Step 2: Generate adversarial branches
Create 4-6 alternative futures that:
- Keep 70-80% of the paper's premises intact
- Flip one structural feature (e.g., takeoff speed, coordination success, alignment difficulty, compute concentration, enforcement capacity)
- Lead to a qualitatively different outcome requiring different strategy

Label each branch concretely, e.g.:
- "Slow takeoff + successful coordination"
- "Fast takeoff + governance failure"
- "Alignment windfall + capability overhang"
- "Distributed compute + unenforceable controls"

### Step 3: Identify discriminating questions
For each pair of branches that diverge significantly, ask:
- What determines which branch we end up on?
- What observation or research result would discriminate between them within 12-24 months?
- What early indicators should we monitor?

### Step 4: Assess cruciality
For each question, evaluate:
- **Divergence magnitude**: How different are the strategies implied by each branch?
- **Current uncertainty**: How confident can we be about which branch is more likely?
- **Tractability**: Could this question be partially answered in the relevant timeframe?

## Output format

Output EXACTLY {{num_questions}} questions as a numbered list. For each question, provide:

1. **[The question]** (one precise sentence)
   - **The branch point:** [which futures does this discriminate between?]
   - **Paper anchor:** [which of the paper's assumptions or predictions does this stress-test?]
   - **Indicators:** If Branch A is more likely, we'd observe [X]. If Branch B, we'd observe [Y].
   - **Time sensitivity:** [when would we need to know this to act on it?]

## Constraints

- Branches must be traceable to the paper's claims—no pure speculation
- Each branch must imply genuinely different optimal strategies
- Questions must be operationalisable (what data, measurement, or proxy would answer them?)
- No science fiction—branches should be consistent with many local facts, just different on key structural features
- Reject branches that are merely "things go well" vs "things go badly"—both branches should represent coherent scenarios with their own logic
