  "reasoning": "Cruciality is high because the adjustment/reconfiguration timescale is a key pivot in the paper\u2019s rebuttal to compute-bottleneck arguments: \u201cdays/weeks\u201d vs \u201cyears/decades\u201d materially changes expectations about early SIE acceleration and the feasibility of governance catching up. Paper-specificity is high because it directly targets the paper\u2019s Jones-style claim that short-run complementarity could rapidly dissolve under abundant fast-thinking AGIs. Tractability is moderate-low: we can study organizational/process reconfiguration in R&D (e.g., lab throughput changes, automation adoption, parallelization limits, software-engineering scaling laws, historical cases of rapid workflow retooling under extreme incentives), but extrapolating to \u2018millions of AGIs\u2019 is highly uncertain and proxy-dependent. Clarity is fairly strong but still ambiguous about what counts as \u201creconfigure\u201d and what metric defines \u201cgood use\u201d (e.g., experiments/day, algorithmic progress rate, effective elasticity \u03c1 shift). Decision hook is excellent because it explicitly links answer regimes to distinct governance strategies. Dead weight is low: most text sets scope, anchors to the paper, and states implications without excess.",
