  "reasoning": "The question targets a key load-bearing step in the paper\u2019s rebuttal to compute bottlenecks: the claim that algorithmic efficiency gains effectively increase the number of usable experiments (and thus relax the bottleneck) rather than merely reducing cost at fixed frontier. If the answer is strongly \u201cno,\u201d the paper\u2019s optimism about early-stage SIE resilience to compute constraints is materially weakened, affecting both forecasting and governance/capability strategy (high cruciality). It is tightly anchored to a specific argument and quote from this paper (high paper-specificity). It is partially answerable via historical analyses of algorithmic efficiency vs. marginal research signal (e.g., how efficiency gains changed iteration speed, ablation breadth, small-model extrapolation success, and frontier-relevant discovery rates), though \u201cduring an SIE\u201d and \u201cmore informative\u201d introduce hard-to-operationalize counterfactual elements (moderate tractability, some clarity loss). Strategic implications are explicitly spelled out (very high decision hook). Minimal fluff beyond helpful context (low dead weight).",
