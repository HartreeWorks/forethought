  "reasoning": "This targets a central crux in the paper\u2019s rebuttal to compute bottlenecks: whether software efficiency gains effectively relax a fixed-compute ceiling by enabling more (or better) experimentation per unit compute. A clear answer would materially shift views on SIE plausibility and where to focus forecasting and governance (high cruciality), and it is anchored to the paper\u2019s specific \u2018#experiments vs compute\u2019 move (good paper-specificity, though similar questions appear in broader scaling/efficiency discussions). It is fairly tractable via empirical trend analysis (tokens/FLOP, loss/FLOP, benchmark performance vs training compute, distillation/early-stopping prevalence), but the \u201cuseful experiments per day\u201d notion is harder to operationalize and may require proxy choices (hence not near-1). The question is mostly clear but bundles multiple candidate metrics and leaves ambiguity about the reference task distribution and what counts as \u2018proportionally more effective experimentation\u2019. The branch-point framing provides an explicit decision-relevant hook. Minimal dead weight: the added bullets mostly sharpen stakes and measurement rather than restating the paper.",
