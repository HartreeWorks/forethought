  "reasoning": "This targets a central load-bearing move in the paper: whether a Jones-style rapid process reconfiguration can quickly raise effective substitutability (\u03c1) toward 0 despite fixed compute, which would materially change SIE plausibility and thus strategic posture (high cruciality). It is tightly anchored to the paper\u2019s specific analogy/assumption about short-run vs long-run bottlenecks and the effective \u03c1 framing (high paper-specificity). It\u2019s partially answerable via empirical studies of agentic R&D orgs (e.g., throughput vs agent-count under fixed compute, measurement of coordination/eval bottlenecks, interventions like automated experiment pipelines), but the extreme scaling regime (100\u201310,000\u00d7) and \u201cwithin weeks\u201d claim make clean identification difficult (moderate tractability). The core question is understandable, but terms like \u201creconfigure\u201d and \u201cmarginal productivity stops collapsing\u201d need more operational definition/metrics (good but not perfect clarity). The branch-point framing and implied update to whether compute bottlenecks bind early vs late gives a clear decision-relevant hook. Some bullet-point scaffolding is helpful, but a bit is non-essential context (low-to-moderate dead weight).",
