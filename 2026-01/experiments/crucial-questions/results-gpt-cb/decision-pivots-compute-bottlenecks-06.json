  "reasoning": "The question targets a key uncertainty in the paper\u2019s rebuttal to compute-bottleneck skepticism: whether increasing researcher quality/clock speed (not just more parallel labor) meaningfully escapes experiment/compute constraints. A solid answer would shift expectations about takeoff speed and therefore governance/alignment posture (explicitly stated), so cruciality and decision hook are high. It is reasonably paper-specific (directly anchored to the paper\u2019s critique that econ CES estimates omit \u2018smarter/faster workers\u2019), though variants of the question could be asked in other takeoff/automation discussions, so not maximal. Tractability is moderate: controlled \u201cfixed experiment budget\u201d studies with agents/teams are conceivable, but external validity to frontier algorithmic progress is hard, and isolating \u2018pure cognition\u2019 vs experimentation effects will require careful task design and may only yield partial/proxy answers. Clarity is good but not perfect: terms like \u2018algorithmic progress\u2019, \u2018bottlenecked experiments\u2019, and the exact outcome metric (SOTA gains? sample-efficiency improvements? idea discovery rate?) need tighter operationalization. Dead weight is low; most context supports the flip and proposed method.",
