  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s use of extinction as a normalization/anchor (v(extinction)=0, v(best)=1) and the resulting \u201cmostly-great\u201d (0.5) and gamble rhetoric, plus how this interacts with intertheoretic normalization in \u00a73.5. This is moderately central because those quantitative thresholds and comparisons are used to motivate and formalize the \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 framing, but much of the paper\u2019s core case (many independent ways to lose value; most plausible views being fussy via scale, bads-sensitivity, etc.) could likely be restated with different anchors or purely ordinally, so the position wouldn\u2019t fully collapse. Strength is limited: the critique mostly raises sensitivity/robustness worries and potential misimpression, rather than showing that the main conclusions change materially under plausible alternative anchoring schemes; it flags a real methodological vulnerability but doesn\u2019t demonstrate a decisive failure. Correctness is high: it\u2019s true that fixing extinction/best as endpoints can be non-innocuous under moral uncertainty and that VNM representability is a substantive restriction (even if acknowledged in \u00a73.1), and that endpoint choices can affect intertheoretic comparisons. Clarity is strong and the argument is cohesive; dead weight is low. It largely stays on a single connected issue (anchoring/normalization and its downstream effects).",

  "revised_text": "### Concession to the defence\nThe counter-response is right that \u00a73.1 explicitly restricts attention to moral views with a VNM-representable betterness ordering over prospects. My earlier critique overstated the extent to which the paper claims neutrality across *all* non-consequentialist theories; many constraint-based views will indeed be excluded.\n\n### What still leaks through\nHowever, two problems remain even within the paper\u2019s stated target class.\n\nFirst, the paper\u2019s presentation invites a broader audience to treat extinction anchoring as methodologically innocuous (\u201cincluding non-consequentialist views\u201d), without foregrounding how strong the restriction is. The issue is not just permissibility-of-acts (which the defence addresses), but whether extinction is a **stable scale anchor** across the remaining theories once we turn to moral uncertainty and normalization.\n\nSecond, even among VNM-friendly views, extinction can be a theoretically special outcome: it often changes what goods/bads exist, whose welfare counts, and what successor scenarios are admissible. That can make comparisons that use \u201cextinction vs best-feasible\u201d as endpoints unusually sensitive to background assumptions (e.g., about replacement successors, cosmic beneficiaries, or whether extinction is lexically bad relative to any survival).\n\n### Where the paper\u2019s apparatus becomes fragile\nThe paper uses extinction not only as a zero point but as a motivator (the \u201c60\u201340 gamble\u201d) and as an intertheoretic normalization reference in \u00a73.5. That risks smuggling substantive stakes into what is portrayed as mere measurement.\n\nThe remaining concern can be stated precisely:\n\n- If different VNM-representable views disagree sharply about how bad extinction is relative to merely \u201cmediocre survival,\u201d then fixing v(extinction)=0 and v(best)=1 forces a controversial alignment of scales.\n- The 0.5 \u201cmostly-great\u201d threshold inherits that controversy, because it is defined by distance from extinction.\n\n### What would address it (without demanding a new theory of everything)\nThe paper could make itself harder to dismiss by:\n\n- clearly delimiting the target class (\u201cVNM-complete theories of betterness over prospects\u201d) at the *introductory* level\n- re-running key claims with an alternative anchor (e.g., a minimally decent survival baseline) and showing **robustness** of \u201cnarrow target\u201d conclusions\n- separating (i) outcome betterness ordering from (ii) act permissibility more explicitly, especially when using motivating gamble rhetoric\n\nAs written, the extinction anchor still looks like a substantive ethical choice that shapes the paper\u2019s quantitative takeaways, not just a convenient normalization.",
