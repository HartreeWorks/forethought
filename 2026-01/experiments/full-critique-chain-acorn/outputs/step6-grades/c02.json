  "reasoning": "The critique targets a meaningful part of the paper\u2019s overall case: the \u00a72.2 \u201ccommon-sense utopia\u201d concession and the subsequent inference in \u00a72.3 that major moral catastrophe risk plausibly remains even given abundance and broad satisfaction. If the critique landed fully, it would weaken the illustrative/intuition-building argument for \u2018eutopian fragility\u2019 and \u2018mostly-great is rare\u2019 under apparently excellent conditions. However, it does not directly engage the paper\u2019s more central and independent support in \u00a73 (the systematic claim that most plausible value functions are fussy/near-linear-in-practice, plus boundedness/aggregation arguments). So centrality is moderate rather than high.\n\nOn strength: the conditionalization point is real\u2014\u00a72.2 includes ingredients (e.g., minimal animal/non-biological suffering, stable cooperation, \u201ctech progress without endangering the world\u201d) that plausibly correlate with the epistemic/moral/governance capacities needed to avoid several downstream failure modes. This undercuts the paper\u2019s ability to treat \u00a72.2 as a \u2018no-steering\u2019 baseline. Still, the critique doesn\u2019t show the residual probability of severe moral error must be small; it mainly claims the paper hasn\u2019t justified that it remains large enough. Since the paper can also appeal to other failure modes less obviously reduced by competence (e.g., value drift/lock-in dynamics, population ethics disagreements, preference engineering), the critique weakens rather than refutes.\n\nCorrectness is high: the identified tension is genuine, and the proposed fixes (anti-correlation cases, historical analogues of competent societies with blind spots, sensitivity analysis) are appropriate. Some claims are somewhat speculative (e.g., that \u00a72.2 achievements entail robust transparency/auditing), but they are framed as plausibility points, not hard assertions.\n\nClarity is strong and the critique is focused on essentially one structural issue. There is little dead weight: most content either makes the conditional-capacity objection or specifies what evidence would close the gap.",

  "revised_text": "### What the defence gets right\nThe counter-response correctly notes that \u00a72.2 is a dialectical concession: \u201cgrant abundance, peace, satisfaction\u2014are we done?\u201d And it is also right that **competence and moral correctness can diverge**; high state capacity does not guarantee correct population ethics or digital rights.\n\nMy earlier critique overstated the idea that upstream competence would *nearly screen off* downstream moral risk. The paper only needs a non-trivial residual probability of high-impact error.\n\n### What still looks structurally awkward\nEven after granting the dialectical intent, \u00a72.2 loads the scenario with achievements that are not mere background niceties but plausibly *constitutive of* the mechanisms that would reduce the very moral risks emphasized in \u00a72.3. In particular, \u201ctechnological progress without endangering the world,\u201d stable cooperation, and \u201cminimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings\u201d look like outputs of unusually strong epistemic norms, governance capacity, and moral inclusion.\n\nThat matters because many of the paper\u2019s failure modes depend on the absence of those same capacities:\n\n- motivated cognition and biased AI advisors are less stable under robust transparency and adversarial auditing\n- rights failures for digital beings are less likely if society already achieved **cross-category moral expansion** (animals, non-biological beings)\n- catastrophic lock-in is less likely if the world already sustains pluralism and institutions that prevent domination\n\nSo the remaining worry is not \u201cthe probability is unchanged,\u201d but that the paper does not justify why *conditional on* a world strong enough to secure \u00a72.2, the residual error probability remains large enough to make \u201cmostly-great is rare\u201d credible.\n\n### What would make the argument harder to shrug off\nTo bridge this gap, the paper needs a clearer claim about where competence stops helping. For example:\n\n- identify which downstream issues are **anti-correlated** with upstream competence (e.g., preference engineering makes satisfaction unreliable precisely in high-tech worlds)\n- offer concrete analogues where high-capacity, broadly liberal orders preserved deep blind spots for long periods (not merely \u201chistory had blind spots,\u201d but \u201chigh competence coexisted with them\u201d)\n- give a sensitivity sketch: how small can the conditional probability of each downstream mistake be while still making \\(P(V>0.5\\mid \\text{Common-sense utopia-ish})\\) low?\n\nAbsent that, \u00a72.2 functions less as a generous concession and more as a stipulation that quietly imports the very steering resources that would undermine the subsequent pessimistic inference.",
