  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real load-bearing move in the paper’s treatment of bounded “difference-making” views: the decision tree and the ‘easygoing bounded views are a narrow slice’ conclusion lean heavily on a two-way partition between separate vs joint aggregation of goods/bads. If that partition is not close to exhaustive, the paper’s bounded-view argument is weakened (moderate centrality), though the overall “no easy eutopia” thesis also rests on other independent pillars (multiplicative fragility; linear/unbounded arguments), so it wouldn’t fully collapse. The objection has moderate strength: it plausibly shows the taxonomy is underspecified, but it doesn’t actually construct or defend a specific structured bounded view that is both (i) philosophically plausible and (ii) genuinely easygoing while (iii) avoiding analogous fussiness elsewhere; it mainly asserts this is possible. Most of the critique is correct (many moral views use lexical thresholds, capped harms, non-additive constraints), but claims like ‘can block both horns without being ad hoc’ are under-argued and somewhat speculative. It is clear, focused, and has little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Goods/Bads Aggregation Fork Is a False Dilemma\" — The paper argues that for difference-making bounded views, separate aggregation makes you obsessively eliminate even tiny bads, while joint aggregation creates “scale tipping,” so only a narrow slice is easygoing and it’s implausible. But the space between these horns is large: many plausible moral views have *structured* aggregation that is neither simple separate-add-then-transform nor simple net-sum-then-transform (e.g., lexical thresholds for severe suffering, capped disutility for minor harms, contextual weighting, or person-affecting constraints). Those structures can block both the “one star system of bad ruins everything” result and the “tiny balance flip turns hell into eutopia” scale-tipping dynamic without being ad hoc. The paper’s inference from the two toy aggregation schemes to “bounded views are fussy except a narrow slice” therefore depends on an unargued claim that realistic bounded views must look like these two forms. This is a load-bearing classification move: it underwrites the decision-tree summary that easygoingness is rare. If the objection holds, the paper must expand its taxonomy to include realistic non-additive, non-linear harm constraints and show that *those* still yield fussiness, rather than treating the fork as exhaustive."
