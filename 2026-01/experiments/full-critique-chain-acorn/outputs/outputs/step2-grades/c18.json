  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper’s moral-uncertainty/intertheoretic-comparison discussion, arguing that letting unbounded views “loom large” yields Pascalian tail-dominance and practical action-guidance failure unless an anti-Pascalian constraint is added. This is a meaningful pressure on one route by which the paper motivates ‘fussiness in practice’ and how moral uncertainty might amplify the no-easy-eutopia takeaway, but it is not the core of the overall position (which also relies heavily on the independent ‘eutopia is fragile / multiplicative factors’ case). Hence moderate centrality. The objection has some bite: unbounded/dominance worries are a known pathology and the paper’s own list of weird possibilities makes the vulnerability salient. However, it somewhat overstates what the paper is committed to (the paper flags intertheoretic comparisons as thorny and does not straightforwardly recommend deferring to the weirdest tail), and the position can likely be patched by adopting a permissibility/robustness stance or a principled bounded-utility/lexicality constraint without obviously collapsing the main ‘targets are narrow’ thesis. So strength is modest rather than high. The critique is mostly accurate in identifying a risk, but its ‘perpetual deference/paralysis’ framing is stronger than what strictly follows from the text, lowering correctness slightly. It is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Moral-Uncertainty Aggregation Backfire\" — The paper argues that under plausible intertheoretic comparison methods (variance normalization, pairwise), unbounded views often loom large, making decision-making “fussy in practice.” But that conclusion threatens to collapse into a decision-theoretic pathology: if unbounded views dominate under uncertainty, then almost any policy becomes hostage to speculative tails (infinite value, acausal trade, simulation bargaining), which the paper itself lists as possible “strange” issues—precisely the ones that make the space unmanageable. In effect, the paper’s attempt to be systematic about fussiness produces an action-guidance failure where the recommended stance is perpetual deference to the weirdest-seeming live possibility. That’s not merely counterintuitive; it undermines the paper’s implied practical moral: that we should take “better futures” work seriously in a grounded way, rather than spiraling into Pascalian paralysis. If the objection holds, the paper must add a principled anti-Pascalian constraint (beyond “thorny”), and then re-check whether the “no easy eutopia” conclusion survives once tail-dominance is curtailed."
