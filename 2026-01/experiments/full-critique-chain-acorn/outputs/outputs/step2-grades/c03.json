  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key move in the paper’s intuitive case for “no easy eutopia”: that even conditioning on something like the paper’s “common-sense utopia” (high stability, competence, low suffering), there remain many largely-independent ways to miss most value, so mostly-great futures are rare. If downstream moral-error risk is strongly reduced by conditioning on those upstream achievements, then the paper’s inference from “many ways to be wrong” to “rarely mostly-great, even given abundance” is weakened, so the attacked point is fairly central (though not fully, since the later technical ‘fussy value function’ argument can still support narrow-target conclusions). The argument is moderately strong: it correctly highlights an implicit (or at least under-argued) independence/robustness assumption, and presses for a mechanism rather than historical analogy. However it doesn’t show the assumption is false, only that it needs support; the paper could reply that the upstream properties don’t guarantee moral reflection/rights recognition, or that certain blind spots are structurally persistent, so the critique is more of a challenge than a refutation. It is mostly correct, clear, focused, and contains little filler.",

  "text": "\"Upstream-Competence Dominance\" — The paper argues that “common-sense utopia” can still be morally catastrophic, because specific downstream choices (digital being rights, population ethics, etc.) can go badly without making inhabitants discontented. But the same scenario description builds in unusually high upstream competence: “scientific understanding and technological progress move ahead, without endangering the world,” “collaboration and bargaining replace war,” and “minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings.” Those are not mere background conditions; they are exactly the sort of epistemic and institutional achievements that, if real, would also make catastrophic downstream moral blind spots less likely than the paper treats them. The paper’s inference from “here are many ways to be wrong” to “mostly-great is rare even under abundance” depends on treating downstream moral error probability as roughly stable even as you condition on extreme upstream success. If this holds, the paper must argue that there are robust mechanisms by which advanced, stable, low-suffering societies systematically preserve deep moral errors (not just “it happened historically”), or else the “no easy eutopia” conclusion becomes a non sequitur from a conditional you’ve already strengthened beyond recognition."
