  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper’s normalization/benchmarking move (defining “best feasible” via a high percentile and then setting it to 1, with “mostly-great” at >0.5), which is moderately central because many headline claims are comparative (“most futures fall far short of the best feasible”). However, much of the paper’s case for “no easy eutopia” is not purely an artifact of that anchor: it also argues (i) qualitatively for many independent axes of moral failure, (ii) via a multiplicative/fragility model, and (iii) that many plausible value functions are intrinsically ‘fussy’ (e.g., linear/unbounded + fat-tailed value-efficiency) in ways that don’t disappear just by changing the percentile used to approximate the near-max. The critique is partly correct that percentile-based anchoring is distribution-relative and can make “wonderful” futures look small compared to speculative tails, so some comparisons (e.g., common-sense utopia vs “best feasible”) depend on how extreme the benchmark is. But it overstates by implying the conclusion is largely “built in”: the benchmark is intended to represent near-max feasible value on a given moral view, and evaluating closeness-to-max is exactly the point of the argument. Clear and focused, with little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Percentile Anchor Trap\" — The paper argues that the intuitive oddity of preferring a 60–40 eutopia/extinction gamble over many “wonderful” futures supports “no easy eutopia,” because it normalizes value by stipulating v(best feasible future)=1 at the 99.99th percentile and v(extinction)=0. But that percentile anchor silently builds the conclusion into the scale: if the 99.99th percentile is defined relative to a distribution that already includes extreme, theory-driven “best uses” (e.g., maximally efficient bliss or galaxy tiling), then almost any humane, stable future is forced to look like “<0.5.” This makes “fussiness” partly an artifact of where you place the 1, not a discovery about what futures are intrinsically near-best. The objection bites because many of the later “linear views are fussy” results depend on comparing “common-sense utopia” to a benchmark whose extremity is distribution-relative rather than normatively justified. If this holds, the paper would need a non–percentile-based grounding for the 1-point (e.g., a principled ceiling independent of a speculative tail), or else the central comparative claims about “mostly-great is rare” lose their force."
