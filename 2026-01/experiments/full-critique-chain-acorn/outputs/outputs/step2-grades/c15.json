  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper’s quantitative “measurement backbone” (extinction=0, best-feasible=1, and ‘mostly-great’>0.5 via 50–50 extinction/eutopia comparisons), which is used repeatedly in the essay’s framing and especially in the moral-uncertainty/normalization discussion. So the attacked point is fairly central, though not fully load-bearing for every strand (the multiplicative-fragility and ‘many ways to go wrong’ case can be made more qualitatively). However, the critique only partly undermines the paper as written, because the paper explicitly restricts attention to moral views that satisfy VNM-style axioms over prospects (including an independence condition), which already bakes in comparability over lotteries; within that framework, using extinction as an anchor is more a representational/convenience choice than an endorsement of “permissible gambling with extinction.” Relatedly, even if some deontological/rights-based views reject extinction-wagers as permissible, the paper can plausibly reply that the comparison is a counterfactual tool for cardinalization, or it can re-anchor the scale without changing the underlying ‘fussiness’ claims. Still, the objection correctly highlights that many non-consequentialist views won’t accept the required axioms/lottery-based calibration, and that anchoring/normalization choices matter a lot—so it’s a real (but not decisive) pressure on the universality and interpretation of the 0.5/0.9 thresholds.",

  "text": "\"The Eutopia/Extinction Commensuration Leak\" — The paper argues that many moral views (including non-consequentialist ones) can be represented with a cardinal value function via VNM axioms, enabling claims like “eutopia is twice as good as X if a 50–50 eutopia/extinction gamble is better than X.” But for many non-consequentialist or rights-based views, extinction is not a mere low-value outcome; it changes which obligations exist and can collapse constraints, so “gambling with extinction” may not be a permissible comparator even if outcomes are rankable in some abstract sense. If extinction can’t serve as the universal zero-point tradeoff partner, then the paper’s operationalization of “mostly-great = above 0.5” becomes ethically unstable: you’re measuring closeness to utopia by a forbidden wager. This is not a definitional nit; it strikes at the paper’s measurement backbone, which it uses repeatedly (e.g., the “60–40 gamble” intuition, the normalization across moral uncertainty). If the objection holds, the paper must rebuild its quantitative comparisons without relying on extinction as a neutral calibrator—likely changing what “fussy” even means in practice."
