  "reasoning": "The critique targets one specific and nontrivial step in the paper’s taxonomy: the claim that many “universe-as-a-whole” bounded views become approximately linear in practice because (given a huge/infinite universe with many other value-bearing regions) humanity’s marginal impact is tiny, making concavity locally linear. This matters to the paper’s attempt to show boundedness doesn’t generally yield easygoingness, but it is only one route to fussiness among several (e.g., unbounded linear views, separate-aggregation bounded difference-making views, and the earlier multiplicative/fragility considerations), so centrality is moderate rather than high.\n\nOn strength, the objection plausibly weakens that linearization move by highlighting (i) dependence on speculative cosmology (aliens/infinite universe), and (ii) potential measure/normalization pathologies in infinite settings that can undermine “well-defined and action-guiding” marginal comparisons. However, it doesn’t fully refute the paper’s point: even in a finite but vast universe, the “tiny marginal change implies near-linearity” argument can still go through; and the paper already gestures at pathologies elsewhere, so some of the critique is more a demand for robustness/insulation than a decisive disproof.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it’s true that the argument’s force depends on assumptions about the size/value-content of the broader universe and that infinite-universe axiologies face measure issues. But the critique arguably overstates the ‘flip’/hostage framing—boundedness looking near-linear may remain plausible under many non-Tegmark, merely-large-universe assumptions.\n\nClarity is high, dead weight is low, and it stays focused on essentially one objection (with subpoints supporting it). Overall, it poses a localized but real challenge rather than a major threat to the full “no easy eutopia” conclusion.",

  "text": "\"The Cosmic Baseline Blackmail\" — The paper argues that bounded “universe-as-a-whole” views become approximately linear because the universe is probably huge (possibly infinite) and our marginal impact is tiny, so boundedness doesn’t rescue easygoingness. But that inference makes your practical ethics hostage to speculative cosmology in a way that undermines the whole project: if moral shape (linear vs bounded-in-practice) flips on whether there are many alien civilizations outside the observable universe, then “no easy eutopia” is not a claim about moral fussy-ness but about your credence in Tegmark-style vastness. Moreover, if the universe is infinite, comparing “difference we make” risks measure/normalization pathologies that the paper itself flags elsewhere, which means the “approximately linear” move is not robust. This is hard to route around because the paper uses cosmic vastness to collapse a large class of bounded views back into linear fussiness. If the objection holds, the paper must either (a) insulate the argument from cosmic-size contingencies by adopting a principled local axiological domain, or (b) confront the measure problem head-on and show that the linearization remains well-defined and action-guiding."
