  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central step in the paper’s case for “fussiness” on unbounded/linear views: the move from (linear in resources) to (narrow target) via a fat-tailed value-per-resource landscape. If that bridge failed, the paper would lose one of its major technical supports for fussiness in the unbounded case, though large parts of the overall thesis would remain (e.g., the many-independent-flaws fragility case; bounded-view arguments; scale-necessity arguments). Strength is moderate: it plausibly presses a real gap—fat-tail dominance is asserted with analogies and separability talk, but the paper does not explicitly show that dominance survives multi-objective/plural-value aggregation rather than being “clipped” by other value dimensions or producing a broad Pareto frontier. However, it does not decisively refute the paper’s claim, because the paper’s ‘fat-tail’ claim is (at least charitably) about the already-aggregated scalar value function v, not a single dimension; and pluralism does not generally imply anti-fat-tail behavior (many aggregators, including multiplicative/Cobb–Douglas-style ones, can preserve or even amplify tail dominance). Correctness is fairly high: the point that multi-dimensional value can change tail behavior and needs explicit modeling is right, but the critique overstates with “tend to anti-fat-tail” and frames it as an inconsistency rather than (more defensibly) an unproven assumption. The critique is clear, focused on one issue, and has little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"Fat-Tail Double Counting\" — The paper argues that because value-per-resource is probably fat-tailed, the best uses dwarf typical uses, so “unless most resources are configured for almost exactly the most valuable kinds of thing” most value is lost. But the paper also argues elsewhere that many moral views value multiple heterogeneous goods (autonomy, diversity, etc.), and that mistakes in any one can crater value; those plural goods tend to *anti*-fat-tail the landscape by creating many tradeoff-frontier solutions rather than a single runaway winner. Put bluntly: you can’t simultaneously claim (i) the value landscape is dominated by extreme outliers in one dimension and (ii) value is fragile across many dimensions, without showing that the same action is an outlier across all dimensions or that cross-dimensional complementarity sharpens rather than flattens the frontier. Otherwise, “fat tails” in one metric become irrelevant once you aggregate plural values; the tail gets clipped by constraints from other goods. This isn’t a surface-level empirical quibble; it attacks the paper’s central technical bridge from linear unboundedness to narrow targeting. If this holds, the paper needs an explicit model of multi-objective fat tails under plausible aggregators (showing that extremal dominance survives pluralism) rather than relying on analogies to wealth and citations."
