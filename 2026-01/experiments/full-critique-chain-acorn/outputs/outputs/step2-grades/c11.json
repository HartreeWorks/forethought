  "reasoning": "The critique targets one illustrative “moral catastrophe” mechanism in §2.3.2 (digital beings get full rights → become voting majority → human values lose). That example is a flagship illustration, but the paper’s overall “no easy eutopia” conclusion is supported by many other independent examples plus the later technical argument about bounded/unbounded value functions; so even fully defusing this scenario would only modestly weaken the overall case (moderate-low centrality).\n\nOn the attacked sub-claim, the critique has fair force: the paper’s ‘catastrophe via outvoting’ story does lean on (i) divergence between digital-majority choices and ‘human-values’ views and (ii) an institutional setup where numerical majority readily implies broad control. Pointing out that competent societies can adopt constitutional/federal/rights-protecting institutions that prevent “fast-growing constituency ⇒ total control” substantially undercuts the scenario as a default/predictable failure mode, unless the paper adds structural reasons enfranchisement tends to produce value drift. However, the paper only needs the possibility/plausibility of large moral error, not strict inevitability, and it already lists multiple routes to “getting it wrong” (motivated cognition, wrong moral beliefs, political capture). So the critique weakens the example but doesn’t fully refute the paper’s broader claim that digital-being governance is a high-stakes, non-obvious axis where moral error is easy.\n\nMost statements in the critique are plausible/true as conditional claims about institutional design, though the ‘background competence’ allegation is somewhat contestable (one can stably grant rights yet still mishandle representation/power transitions). The critique is clear, focused, and contains little filler.",

  "text": "\"The Digital Majority Scarecrow\" — The paper argues that even giving digital beings full rights can be catastrophic because they could outvote humans, and on views that prize “human values,” that loses almost everything worthwhile. But that inference tacitly assumes (i) digital beings’ preferences will systematically diverge from humane values, and (ii) democratic aggregation is the governance baseline, rather than constitutional, federal, or rights-protecting structures that decouple population share from value lock-in. In a world competent enough to stably grant rights to radically new moral patients, the institutional response to “fast-growing constituency” is precisely to design representation and rights so that “numerical majority” does not equal “total control,” so the scenario’s catastrophe mechanism conflicts with the background competence the paper keeps presupposing. This matters because “digital beings” is one of the paper’s flagship examples of non-obvious moral catastrophe within common-sense utopia. If the objection holds, the paper must show that there are *structural* reasons why digital enfranchisement predictably causes value drift (not merely that it’s imaginable), or else this example stops supporting the claim that the eutopian target is narrow by default."
