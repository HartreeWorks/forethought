  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real sub-argument in the position: the move from (i) preference engineering + adaptive satisfaction to (ii) “approval doesn’t track value,” supporting the claim that even subjectively wonderful futures can be morally mediocre. However, this is only one supporting wedge among many (multiplicative fragility, population ethics, digital minds, bounded/unbounded ‘fussy’ value functions), so centrality is moderate-low. The objection has some bite: if preferences can be shaped, the paper should address why we wouldn’t (or couldn’t) also shape robust moral concern, which would reduce some moral-catastrophe risks and partially undermine the “unnoticed mediocrity” story. Still, it doesn’t seriously touch the more structural arguments that eutopia is narrow because of moral-theoretic fussiness or combinatorial fragility across many dimensions; preference engineering could itself be one more dimension and may be captured by their ‘navigation/steering’ factors. The critique is mostly correct but makes a somewhat speculative leap that this would “broaden the target substantially” without showing it overcomes the paper’s broader reasons for fussiness. It is clear, focused on a single issue, and has little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Preference-Engineering Inversion\" — The paper argues that future beings could engineer preferences to be satisfied with “tragically mediocre circumstances,” so inhabitants won’t detect lost value; hence moral catastrophe can coexist with universal approval. But this cuts both ways: if preference engineering is available, then *so is* engineering robust moral concern, empathy, and aversion to cruelty, potentially making certain catastrophic errors (e.g., factory-farming analogs for digital minds) far less likely than today. The paper uses malleability of preferences as a threat vector, yet doesn’t integrate the symmetric possibility that value-aligned preference shaping is an unusually powerful steering force toward mostly-great futures. That’s not a superficial optimism; it attacks the “approval doesn’t track value” wedge the paper drives between subjective satisfaction and objective goodness. If the objection holds, the paper must argue that preference engineering is systematically more likely to entrench selfish or parochial equilibria than to amplify moral regard—or else admit that the same technology broadens the eutopian target substantially."
