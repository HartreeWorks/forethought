  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key step in the paper’s Section 3 case that many plausible moral views (especially unbounded linear ones) make mostly-great futures a narrow target: the move from linear/separable value to the claim that resources must be used in “very specific” ways. If that step failed, the paper’s systematic sweep would be materially weakened, though not fully overturned because the broader “no easy eutopia” thesis also relies on earlier multiplicative-fragility/moral-catastrophe considerations. The critique has moderate strength: it plausibly shows that linearity/separability alone does not force a needle-like optimum; it is compatible with many near-maximizing “tiles” (a plateau) that could broaden the target. However, the paper does not rely on linearity alone; it explicitly adds a fat-tailed value-efficiency premise and argues there is (at some granularity) a best arrangement to replicate. The critique under-engages these added premises, and somewhat overstates the paper as requiring a single maximizer rather than a small/highly selective set. Still, it correctly flags an under-justified inference: the paper needs more defense that high-efficiency configurations are rare rather than abundant/robust. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Linear-Separability Equivocation\" — The paper argues that unbounded linear views are separable across resource parcels, therefore require using “most accessible resources” and using them in “very specific” ways, making mostly-great futures a narrow target. But the step from linearity to “very specific use” relies on treating the value-efficiency landscape as dominated by a single maximizer (or a tiny set), whereas linear separability more naturally supports a large space of near-maximizers repeated across parcels (many locally optimal “tiles”), especially if value arises from diverse flourishing rather than a single engineered experience. In that case, linearity doesn’t imply specificity; it implies replicability, and replicability can make the target broad if there’s a wide plateau of high-efficiency tiles. This matters because the paper’s “linear views are fussy” claim does enormous work in Section 3’s systematic sweep. If the objection holds, the paper must justify why the high-value region is needle-like rather than plateau-like (and why diversity/robustness considerations don’t create many near-maximal tiles), or else linearity ceases to entail fussiness."
