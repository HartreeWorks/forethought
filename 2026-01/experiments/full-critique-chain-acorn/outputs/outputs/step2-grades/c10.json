  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific (and rhetorically salient) step in Section 3.3: the ‘1 in 10^22 bad resources’ example used to argue that separately-aggregating bounded views are still extremely fussy because tiny fractions of bad scale to large absolute bad. That supports the paper’s broader claim that many bounded views are fussy, but it is only one pillar among several (e.g., linear/unbounded arguments, multiplicative fragility, other paths to fussiness), so centrality is moderate rather than high. The objection has real force: the paper’s inference from “fraction of resources” to “moral magnitude” does rely on an extensiveness/commensurability assumption, and many of the paper’s own candidate ‘bads’ (rights/ownership/injustice/death) plausibly behave more like relational/threshold wrongs than continuously extensive quantities. Still, the paper can likely reply by restricting the 10^22 argument to extensive bads (notably suffering) or by arguing that relational wrongs replicated across many sites still generate extensive disvalue, so the critique weakens the example and some generality, but doesn’t fully overturn the bounded-views-fussiness claim. The critique is mostly correct, clear, focused, and has little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The One-in-10^22 Rhetoric Mistakes Extensiveness for Intensity\" — The paper argues that on separately aggregating bounded views, using “one resource in 10^22” for bads prevents a mostly-great future, because in a cosmic expansion that still amounts to a star system’s worth of bad. But that conclusion depends on assuming “badness” scales extensively with resources in a morally homogeneous way, while many of the paper’s own motivating examples (e.g., rights violations, ownership, death, injustice) are not extensive in that sense: the moral gravity is often about *relations*, *institutions*, or *types of wrongdoing*, not the volume of matter processed. A star system of mild unfairness is not obviously commensurate with a star system of severe torture, and the model’s conversion of “fraction of resources” into “moral magnitude” collapses crucial structure. The point matters because the “tiny fraction of bad blocks mostly-great” result is a central pillar in Section 3’s claim that bounded views are fussy too. If the objection holds, the paper must justify the extensiveness assumption for bads (and goods) across cosmic scale, or else re-derive fussiness under a relational/threshold conception of wrongs—where the 10^22 argument may fail."
