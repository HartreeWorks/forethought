  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central methodological move: the paper’s operationalization of “fussiness” via a probability distribution over futures conditional on survival and on there being no *additional* serious de dicto optimization pressure. If that conditional were illegitimate (i.e., it carved away the mechanisms that would normally steer toward good outcomes), then the paper’s inference from ‘low mostly-great probability under that distribution’ to ‘narrow target’ would be weakened.\n\nHowever, the critique overstates what is being excluded. The paper does not exclude all de dicto value-driven institutions “by default”; it conditions on there being no *more serious* coordinated optimization for the very best outcomes than exists today. Since current societies already contain de dicto moral/institutional steering, the critique partly attacks a straw interpretation (“morally indifferent civilization that nonetheless achieves stunning competence”). Also, the essay’s broader case for fragility (many independent ways to go wrong; multiplicative-factor model; moral-view taxonomy) does not hinge entirely on that specific conditional, so refuting it wouldn’t collapse the whole ‘no easy eutopia’ thesis.\n\nNet: the critique is clear, focused, and raises a real modeling/conditioning worry, but it only moderately undermines the argument because it likely misreads the conditional and doesn’t show that realistic endogenous moral optimization would make mostly-great futures common rather than still rare.",

  "text": "\"The De Dicto Smuggling Problem\" — The paper argues that, conditional on “no serious optimisation pressure … to promote the very best outcomes de dicto,” mostly-great futures are unlikely on fussy views, so the target is narrow. But “de dicto” exclusion quietly removes the main real-world channel by which good futures arise: agents optimize for what they take to be good under descriptions they endorse, which is exactly “de dicto,” and even “by default” institutions (science, rights, markets, democratic accountability) are de dicto in structure. Once you exclude de dicto optimization, you are no longer modeling “default” social evolution; you are modeling a bizarrely morally indifferent civilization that nonetheless achieves stunning competence. The paper’s inference from that model to “no easy eutopia” is therefore hostage to an implausible conditional that strips away the very steering mechanisms that would broaden the target. If this holds, the paper must either defend that the de dicto exclusion approximates reality (despite moralized institutions), or rerun the argument under realistic endogenous moral optimization—where the narrow-target claim is much harder to sustain."
