  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific inferential step in the paper’s case that unbounded linear views are fussy: the move from separability/linearity to there being (effectively) a single “value-efficient arrangement” that must be replicated at scale, making the target narrow. If this step were undermined, it would weaken one important pillar of the ‘fussy’ conclusion for linear views, but it would not collapse the overall “no easy eutopia” thesis, which is also supported by (i) the earlier ‘fragility/multiplicative factors’ argument and (ii) the extended discussion of bounded views and goods/bads aggregation. Hence moderate centrality.\n\nOn strength: the critique correctly notes that linearity/separability alone does not entail a unique best ‘tile’ or a monoculture; linear theories can allow many distinct arrangements to tie for best, or a best arrangement that itself encodes internal diversity, or a wide plateau of near-optimal options. However, the paper’s narrow-target claim also leans on a fat-tailed distribution of value-efficiency, not just uniqueness, and the critique largely doesn’t engage that (e.g., why a pluralistic portfolio would avoid steep value drops under fat tails). So it weakens the attacked step but doesn’t strongly refute the paper’s full linear-view fussiness argument.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it’s broadly true that the ‘one tile’ inference is not forced and that diversity can be valued even under separability. Some phrasing overreaches (e.g., implying the paper is committed to rejecting any highly concentrated optimum just because it lists similarity/diversity as one possible risk), since the paper presents that as one among many moral-catastrophe possibilities rather than a decisive objection. Clarity is high, dead weight low, and it stays on one issue.",

  "text": "\"The Best-Use Monoculture Problem\" — The paper argues that on linear views, because there exists some “value-efficient arrangement” of resources, mostly-great futures require recreating that arrangement across most matter, making the target narrow. But that presumes that moral truth, if linear, selects a single dominant pattern rather than endorsing a pluralistic portfolio (many kinds of flourishing, many cultures, many forms of mind informing one another), and it’s exactly in futuristic contexts that diversity is often treated as an intrinsic good or a hedge against moral uncertainty. Ironically, the paper elsewhere treats “wrong similarity/diversity tradeoff” as a catastrophe risk, which implies that any theory that crowns one arrangement as overwhelmingly best is itself suspect by the paper’s own lights. So the move from linearity to “one tile to rule them all” appears in tension with the paper’s broader pluralism about value dimensions. If the objection holds, the paper must either defend why moral value is likely to be maximized by near-monoculture (and why that’s not itself a giant moral risk), or concede that linearity can coexist with broad near-optimal pluralism, weakening fussiness."
