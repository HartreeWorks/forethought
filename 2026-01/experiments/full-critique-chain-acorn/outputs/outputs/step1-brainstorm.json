    "text": "\"The Percentile Anchor Trap\" — The paper argues that the intuitive oddity of preferring a 60–40 eutopia/extinction gamble over many “wonderful” futures supports “no easy eutopia,” because it normalizes value by stipulating v(best feasible future)=1 at the 99.99th percentile and v(extinction)=0. But that percentile anchor silently builds the conclusion into the scale: if the 99.99th percentile is defined relative to a distribution that already includes extreme, theory-driven “best uses” (e.g., maximally efficient bliss or galaxy tiling), then almost any humane, stable future is forced to look like “<0.5.” This makes “fussiness” partly an artifact of where you place the 1, not a discovery about what futures are intrinsically near-best. The objection bites because many of the later “linear views are fussy” results depend on comparing “common-sense utopia” to a benchmark whose extremity is distribution-relative rather than normatively justified. If this holds, the paper would need a non–percentile-based grounding for the 1-point (e.g., a principled ceiling independent of a speculative tail), or else the central comparative claims about “mostly-great is rare” lose their force."

    "text": "\"The Factorization Fallacy\" — The paper argues that single moral flaws can erase most value, because overall value is plausibly the product of many “relatively independent” factors (Section 2.4), yielding a distribution where mostly-great futures are rare. The trouble is that the paper’s own catalog of “flaws” (digital rights, population ethics, allocation of space resources, etc.) is not independent in the relevant sense: the same institutional competence, epistemic norms, and moral deliberation that fixes one typically fixes many, creating positive correlation that destroys the “tiny orange target” geometry. Once correlations are strong, the product-of-uniforms toy model stops being an intuition pump for fragility and becomes a misleading picture: you can get “clusters” where doing well on one dimension predicts doing well across the board, making mostly-great futures common conditional on a few upstream governance variables. This isn’t a fixable “add a paragraph” issue because the multiplicative model is load-bearing for the essay’s main intuitive turn: that utopia recedes like a mirage because many independent pitfalls multiply. If the objection holds, the paper must replace the factor model with an explicit causal structure (e.g., a small number of upstream latent variables) and show that the resulting distribution still makes mostly-great futures rare."

    "text": "\"Upstream-Competence Dominance\" — The paper argues that “common-sense utopia” can still be morally catastrophic, because specific downstream choices (digital being rights, population ethics, etc.) can go badly without making inhabitants discontented. But the same scenario description builds in unusually high upstream competence: “scientific understanding and technological progress move ahead, without endangering the world,” “collaboration and bargaining replace war,” and “minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings.” Those are not mere background conditions; they are exactly the sort of epistemic and institutional achievements that, if real, would also make catastrophic downstream moral blind spots less likely than the paper treats them. The paper’s inference from “here are many ways to be wrong” to “mostly-great is rare even under abundance” depends on treating downstream moral error probability as roughly stable even as you condition on extreme upstream success. If this holds, the paper must argue that there are robust mechanisms by which advanced, stable, low-suffering societies systematically preserve deep moral errors (not just “it happened historically”), or else the “no easy eutopia” conclusion becomes a non sequitur from a conditional you’ve already strengthened beyond recognition."

    "text": "\"The Moral-Catastrophe Gish Gallop\" — The paper argues that eutopia is a narrow target because across many moral perspectives (religious, conservative, pro-life, socialist, environmentalist, animal welfare), the present is judged deeply flawed, suggesting “non-obvious but severe flaws are the norm.” The hidden crux is that this treats “many incompatible moral perspectives can label something catastrophic” as evidence that the thing is likely far from the moral optimum, but that inference reverses under a plausible meta-epistemic view: widespread disagreement is evidence that “catastrophe” judgments are cheaply generated by value-laden framings, not that reality is near-maximally flawed. In other words, the paper uses pluralism to argue for fragility, but pluralism also supports the opposite: that “catastrophe” is not a stable signal and therefore should not update you strongly toward narrow-target pessimism. This is hard to route around because Sections 2.1–2.3 use the cross-view “catastrophe” rhetoric to set the emotional and epistemic baseline for fussiness. If the objection holds, the paper needs a discrimination principle that filters which moral frameworks are “live” in a way that doesn’t smuggle in the conclusion (and then show that, among those, catastrophic moral error remains likely)."

    "text": "\"The De Dicto Smuggling Problem\" — The paper argues that, conditional on “no serious optimisation pressure … to promote the very best outcomes de dicto,” mostly-great futures are unlikely on fussy views, so the target is narrow. But “de dicto” exclusion quietly removes the main real-world channel by which good futures arise: agents optimize for what they take to be good under descriptions they endorse, which is exactly “de dicto,” and even “by default” institutions (science, rights, markets, democratic accountability) are de dicto in structure. Once you exclude de dicto optimization, you are no longer modeling “default” social evolution; you are modeling a bizarrely morally indifferent civilization that nonetheless achieves stunning competence. The paper’s inference from that model to “no easy eutopia” is therefore hostage to an implausible conditional that strips away the very steering mechanisms that would broaden the target. If this holds, the paper must either defend that the de dicto exclusion approximates reality (despite moralized institutions), or rerun the argument under realistic endogenous moral optimization—where the narrow-target claim is much harder to sustain."

    "text": "\"The Linear-Separability Equivocation\" — The paper argues that unbounded linear views are separable across resource parcels, therefore require using “most accessible resources” and using them in “very specific” ways, making mostly-great futures a narrow target. But the step from linearity to “very specific use” relies on treating the value-efficiency landscape as dominated by a single maximizer (or a tiny set), whereas linear separability more naturally supports a large space of near-maximizers repeated across parcels (many locally optimal “tiles”), especially if value arises from diverse flourishing rather than a single engineered experience. In that case, linearity doesn’t imply specificity; it implies replicability, and replicability can make the target broad if there’s a wide plateau of high-efficiency tiles. This matters because the paper’s “linear views are fussy” claim does enormous work in Section 3’s systematic sweep. If the objection holds, the paper must justify why the high-value region is needle-like rather than plateau-like (and why diversity/robustness considerations don’t create many near-maximal tiles), or else linearity ceases to entail fussiness."

    "text": "\"Fat-Tail Double Counting\" — The paper argues that because value-per-resource is probably fat-tailed, the best uses dwarf typical uses, so “unless most resources are configured for almost exactly the most valuable kinds of thing” most value is lost. But the paper also argues elsewhere that many moral views value multiple heterogeneous goods (autonomy, diversity, etc.), and that mistakes in any one can crater value; those plural goods tend to *anti*-fat-tail the landscape by creating many tradeoff-frontier solutions rather than a single runaway winner. Put bluntly: you can’t simultaneously claim (i) the value landscape is dominated by extreme outliers in one dimension and (ii) value is fragile across many dimensions, without showing that the same action is an outlier across all dimensions or that cross-dimensional complementarity sharpens rather than flattens the frontier. Otherwise, “fat tails” in one metric become irrelevant once you aggregate plural values; the tail gets clipped by constraints from other goods. This isn’t a surface-level empirical quibble; it attacks the paper’s central technical bridge from linear unboundedness to narrow targeting. If this holds, the paper needs an explicit model of multi-objective fat tails under plausible aggregators (showing that extremal dominance survives pluralism) rather than relying on analogies to wealth and citations."

    "text": "\"The Cosmic Baseline Blackmail\" — The paper argues that bounded “universe-as-a-whole” views become approximately linear because the universe is probably huge (possibly infinite) and our marginal impact is tiny, so boundedness doesn’t rescue easygoingness. But that inference makes your practical ethics hostage to speculative cosmology in a way that undermines the whole project: if moral shape (linear vs bounded-in-practice) flips on whether there are many alien civilizations outside the observable universe, then “no easy eutopia” is not a claim about moral fussy-ness but about your credence in Tegmark-style vastness. Moreover, if the universe is infinite, comparing “difference we make” risks measure/normalization pathologies that the paper itself flags elsewhere, which means the “approximately linear” move is not robust. This is hard to route around because the paper uses cosmic vastness to collapse a large class of bounded views back into linear fussiness. If the objection holds, the paper must either (a) insulate the argument from cosmic-size contingencies by adopting a principled local axiological domain, or (b) confront the measure problem head-on and show that the linearization remains well-defined and action-guiding."

    "text": "\"The Goods/Bads Aggregation Fork Is a False Dilemma\" — The paper argues that for difference-making bounded views, separate aggregation makes you obsessively eliminate even tiny bads, while joint aggregation creates “scale tipping,” so only a narrow slice is easygoing and it’s implausible. But the space between these horns is large: many plausible moral views have *structured* aggregation that is neither simple separate-add-then-transform nor simple net-sum-then-transform (e.g., lexical thresholds for severe suffering, capped disutility for minor harms, contextual weighting, or person-affecting constraints). Those structures can block both the “one star system of bad ruins everything” result and the “tiny balance flip turns hell into eutopia” scale-tipping dynamic without being ad hoc. The paper’s inference from the two toy aggregation schemes to “bounded views are fussy except a narrow slice” therefore depends on an unargued claim that realistic bounded views must look like these two forms. This is a load-bearing classification move: it underwrites the decision-tree summary that easygoingness is rare. If the objection holds, the paper must expand its taxonomy to include realistic non-additive, non-linear harm constraints and show that *those* still yield fussiness, rather than treating the fork as exhaustive."

    "text": "\"The One-in-10^22 Rhetoric Mistakes Extensiveness for Intensity\" — The paper argues that on separately aggregating bounded views, using “one resource in 10^22” for bads prevents a mostly-great future, because in a cosmic expansion that still amounts to a star system’s worth of bad. But that conclusion depends on assuming “badness” scales extensively with resources in a morally homogeneous way, while many of the paper’s own motivating examples (e.g., rights violations, ownership, death, injustice) are not extensive in that sense: the moral gravity is often about *relations*, *institutions*, or *types of wrongdoing*, not the volume of matter processed. A star system of mild unfairness is not obviously commensurate with a star system of severe torture, and the model’s conversion of “fraction of resources” into “moral magnitude” collapses crucial structure. The point matters because the “tiny fraction of bad blocks mostly-great” result is a central pillar in Section 3’s claim that bounded views are fussy too. If the objection holds, the paper must justify the extensiveness assumption for bads (and goods) across cosmic scale, or else re-derive fussiness under a relational/threshold conception of wrongs—where the 10^22 argument may fail."

    "text": "\"The Digital Majority Scarecrow\" — The paper argues that even giving digital beings full rights can be catastrophic because they could outvote humans, and on views that prize “human values,” that loses almost everything worthwhile. But that inference tacitly assumes (i) digital beings’ preferences will systematically diverge from humane values, and (ii) democratic aggregation is the governance baseline, rather than constitutional, federal, or rights-protecting structures that decouple population share from value lock-in. In a world competent enough to stably grant rights to radically new moral patients, the institutional response to “fast-growing constituency” is precisely to design representation and rights so that “numerical majority” does not equal “total control,” so the scenario’s catastrophe mechanism conflicts with the background competence the paper keeps presupposing. This matters because “digital beings” is one of the paper’s flagship examples of non-obvious moral catastrophe within common-sense utopia. If the objection holds, the paper must show that there are *structural* reasons why digital enfranchisement predictably causes value drift (not merely that it’s imaginable), or else this example stops supporting the claim that the eutopian target is narrow by default."

    "text": "\"The Preference-Engineering Inversion\" — The paper argues that future beings could engineer preferences to be satisfied with “tragically mediocre circumstances,” so inhabitants won’t detect lost value; hence moral catastrophe can coexist with universal approval. But this cuts both ways: if preference engineering is available, then *so is* engineering robust moral concern, empathy, and aversion to cruelty, potentially making certain catastrophic errors (e.g., factory-farming analogs for digital minds) far less likely than today. The paper uses malleability of preferences as a threat vector, yet doesn’t integrate the symmetric possibility that value-aligned preference shaping is an unusually powerful steering force toward mostly-great futures. That’s not a superficial optimism; it attacks the “approval doesn’t track value” wedge the paper drives between subjective satisfaction and objective goodness. If the objection holds, the paper must argue that preference engineering is systematically more likely to entrench selfish or parochial equilibria than to amplify moral regard—or else admit that the same technology broadens the eutopian target substantially."

    "text": "\"The Mirage Argument Proves Too Much\" — The paper argues that hedonic-treadmill-like psychology makes eutopia “recede” as we approach it, supporting the idea that mostly-great futures are harder than they seem. But if the mirage dynamic is epistemic rather than axiological—i.e., it’s about our shifting standards and limited imagination—then it undercuts the paper’s own confidence that futures “fall dramatically short” in objective value, since the very mechanism says we are unreliable judges of how close we are to the ceiling. The argument is self-undermining: the more you emphasize unconstrained bias in future-evaluation, the less license you have to assert that the target is narrow rather than our evaluative lens being unstable. This is hard to route around because the mirage/treadmill discussion is doing real rhetorical work bridging common intuition to the “no easy eutopia” conclusion. If this holds, the paper must separate (a) psychological shifting of standards from (b) genuine moral fragility with independent theoretical support; otherwise the mirage story dissolves the evidential base it’s meant to strengthen."

    "text": "\"The Best-Use Monoculture Problem\" — The paper argues that on linear views, because there exists some “value-efficient arrangement” of resources, mostly-great futures require recreating that arrangement across most matter, making the target narrow. But that presumes that moral truth, if linear, selects a single dominant pattern rather than endorsing a pluralistic portfolio (many kinds of flourishing, many cultures, many forms of mind informing one another), and it’s exactly in futuristic contexts that diversity is often treated as an intrinsic good or a hedge against moral uncertainty. Ironically, the paper elsewhere treats “wrong similarity/diversity tradeoff” as a catastrophe risk, which implies that any theory that crowns one arrangement as overwhelmingly best is itself suspect by the paper’s own lights. So the move from linearity to “one tile to rule them all” appears in tension with the paper’s broader pluralism about value dimensions. If the objection holds, the paper must either defend why moral value is likely to be maximized by near-monoculture (and why that’s not itself a giant moral risk), or concede that linearity can coexist with broad near-optimal pluralism, weakening fussiness."

    "text": "\"The Eutopia/Extinction Commensuration Leak\" — The paper argues that many moral views (including non-consequentialist ones) can be represented with a cardinal value function via VNM axioms, enabling claims like “eutopia is twice as good as X if a 50–50 eutopia/extinction gamble is better than X.” But for many non-consequentialist or rights-based views, extinction is not a mere low-value outcome; it changes which obligations exist and can collapse constraints, so “gambling with extinction” may not be a permissible comparator even if outcomes are rankable in some abstract sense. If extinction can’t serve as the universal zero-point tradeoff partner, then the paper’s operationalization of “mostly-great = above 0.5” becomes ethically unstable: you’re measuring closeness to utopia by a forbidden wager. This is not a definitional nit; it strikes at the paper’s measurement backbone, which it uses repeatedly (e.g., the “60–40 gamble” intuition, the normalization across moral uncertainty). If the objection holds, the paper must rebuild its quantitative comparisons without relying on extinction as a neutral calibrator—likely changing what “fussy” even means in practice."

    "text": "\"The Survival/Flourishing Separation Breaks Under Value Lock-In\" — The paper argues that we can evaluate “Flourishing” conditional on “Surviving,” and then ask whether eutopia is easy given survival. But many of the paper’s own catastrophe mechanisms (value lock-in by early generations, initial space resource capture, digital polity formation) are *coupled* to survival pathways: the actions that reduce extinction risk (centralized control, powerful aligned AI, rapid expansion) may simultaneously increase the risk of moral lock-in or monoculture, meaning “survival” and “flourishing” aren’t separable axes. If the coupling is strong, then “conditional on survival” is not a stable reference class; different survival strategies select different flourishing distributions, and “no easy eutopia” becomes partly a claim about which survival policies we pursue. This matters because the introduction frames the practical upshot as shifting attention between existential risk reduction and improving futures conditional on survival. If the objection holds, the paper must model the joint distribution and show that “eutopia is hard” is not just an artifact of survivorship pathways that already embed moral tradeoffs."

    "text": "\"The Adversarial Eutopia Exploit\" — The paper argues that because many subtle moral errors can erase most value, we should treat the eutopian target as narrow and hard to hit without deliberate optimization. But that very narrative is a gift to bad actors: any faction can weaponize “moral catastrophe risk” to justify seizing control (“we must lock in values now to avoid losing 90% of cosmic value”), since the paper’s framework treats lock-in risk and moral error risk as symmetric but then emotionally weights the loss-of-value side. The result is a normative boomerang: the more you publicize “one flaw can ruin everything,” the more you incentivize authoritarian preemption, which is itself one of the paper’s listed meta-level perils (“hyper-vigilant,” “overbearing,” “paranoid”). This is hard to patch because it’s not about miscommunication; it’s about the strategic landscape created by the central thesis. If the objection holds, the paper must incorporate adversarial equilibrium effects—showing how a “no easy eutopia” worldview can be propagated without predictably increasing the very moral catastrophe risks it worries about."

    "text": "\"The Moral-Uncertainty Aggregation Backfire\" — The paper argues that under plausible intertheoretic comparison methods (variance normalization, pairwise), unbounded views often loom large, making decision-making “fussy in practice.” But that conclusion threatens to collapse into a decision-theoretic pathology: if unbounded views dominate under uncertainty, then almost any policy becomes hostage to speculative tails (infinite value, acausal trade, simulation bargaining), which the paper itself lists as possible “strange” issues—precisely the ones that make the space unmanageable. In effect, the paper’s attempt to be systematic about fussiness produces an action-guidance failure where the recommended stance is perpetual deference to the weirdest-seeming live possibility. That’s not merely counterintuitive; it undermines the paper’s implied practical moral: that we should take “better futures” work seriously in a grounded way, rather than spiraling into Pascalian paralysis. If the objection holds, the paper must add a principled anti-Pascalian constraint (beyond “thorny”), and then re-check whether the “no easy eutopia” conclusion survives once tail-dominance is curtailed."

    "text": "\"The Reversal from Historical Moral Progress\" — The paper argues that because historical societies confidently endorsed slavery, subjugation, etc., we should expect future societies to harbor non-obvious moral catastrophes, implying eutopia is fragile. But the same historical record also supports a reversal: many societies did, eventually, correct those errors through institutionalized critique (abolition movements, rights expansion, scientific understanding of suffering), suggesting that once a civilization reaches high literacy, pluralism, and stable prosperity—the very preconditions of the paper’s common-sense utopia—the default trajectory is *toward* moral correction, not persistent catastrophe. The paper treats “it wasn’t obvious then” as evidence of likely future blindness, but you could instead treat “we can look back and see it now” as evidence that reflection mechanisms work and widen the target over time. This is hard to route around because Section 2.1 is a foundational intuition pump: it’s meant to make “non-obvious catastrophe” feel normal rather than exceptional. If the objection holds, the paper must argue that future moral errors will be systematically harder to detect than past ones even under improved reflection—otherwise history is ambiguous and cannot bear the weight placed on it."

    "text": "\"The Target-Size/Value-Loss Conflation\" — The paper argues that because many possible moral flaws can reduce value by large fractions, the set of mostly-great futures is narrow (small target). But “many ways to lose value” does not entail “low probability of being mostly-great” without a probabilistic claim about how likely each flaw is in the relevant future-generating process; otherwise you’re conflating *axiological sensitivity* (big losses are possible) with *dynamical likelihood* (big losses are typical). The paper tries to bridge this gap with the product-of-factors toy model, but that model is itself a probability model smuggled in under the guise of an axiological metaphor, and it is not derived from any account of how future institutions, technology, and moral learning actually evolve. This is not a generic “more evidence” complaint: it targets the paper’s central inferential leap from “there exist many catastrophic dimensions” to “mostly-great is rare by default,” which is the thesis. If the objection holds, the paper must commit to a generative model of future trajectories (even coarse) and show that it yields low mass above 0.5—otherwise “no easy eutopia” remains a catalogue of imaginable disasters rather than a conclusion about target size."
