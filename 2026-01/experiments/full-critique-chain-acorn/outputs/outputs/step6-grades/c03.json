  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper’s use of extinction as a normalization/anchor (v(extinction)=0, v(best)=1) and the resulting “mostly-great” (0.5) and gamble rhetoric, plus how this interacts with intertheoretic normalization in §3.5. This is moderately central because those quantitative thresholds and comparisons are used to motivate and formalize the ‘no easy eutopia’ framing, but much of the paper’s core case (many independent ways to lose value; most plausible views being fussy via scale, bads-sensitivity, etc.) could likely be restated with different anchors or purely ordinally, so the position wouldn’t fully collapse. Strength is limited: the critique mostly raises sensitivity/robustness worries and potential misimpression, rather than showing that the main conclusions change materially under plausible alternative anchoring schemes; it flags a real methodological vulnerability but doesn’t demonstrate a decisive failure. Correctness is high: it’s true that fixing extinction/best as endpoints can be non-innocuous under moral uncertainty and that VNM representability is a substantive restriction (even if acknowledged in §3.1), and that endpoint choices can affect intertheoretic comparisons. Clarity is strong and the argument is cohesive; dead weight is low. It largely stays on a single connected issue (anchoring/normalization and its downstream effects).",

  "revised_text": "### Concession to the defence\nThe counter-response is right that §3.1 explicitly restricts attention to moral views with a VNM-representable betterness ordering over prospects. My earlier critique overstated the extent to which the paper claims neutrality across *all* non-consequentialist theories; many constraint-based views will indeed be excluded.\n\n### What still leaks through\nHowever, two problems remain even within the paper’s stated target class.\n\nFirst, the paper’s presentation invites a broader audience to treat extinction anchoring as methodologically innocuous (“including non-consequentialist views”), without foregrounding how strong the restriction is. The issue is not just permissibility-of-acts (which the defence addresses), but whether extinction is a **stable scale anchor** across the remaining theories once we turn to moral uncertainty and normalization.\n\nSecond, even among VNM-friendly views, extinction can be a theoretically special outcome: it often changes what goods/bads exist, whose welfare counts, and what successor scenarios are admissible. That can make comparisons that use “extinction vs best-feasible” as endpoints unusually sensitive to background assumptions (e.g., about replacement successors, cosmic beneficiaries, or whether extinction is lexically bad relative to any survival).\n\n### Where the paper’s apparatus becomes fragile\nThe paper uses extinction not only as a zero point but as a motivator (the “60–40 gamble”) and as an intertheoretic normalization reference in §3.5. That risks smuggling substantive stakes into what is portrayed as mere measurement.\n\nThe remaining concern can be stated precisely:\n\n- If different VNM-representable views disagree sharply about how bad extinction is relative to merely “mediocre survival,” then fixing v(extinction)=0 and v(best)=1 forces a controversial alignment of scales.\n- The 0.5 “mostly-great” threshold inherits that controversy, because it is defined by distance from extinction.\n\n### What would address it (without demanding a new theory of everything)\nThe paper could make itself harder to dismiss by:\n\n- clearly delimiting the target class (“VNM-complete theories of betterness over prospects”) at the *introductory* level\n- re-running key claims with an alternative anchor (e.g., a minimally decent survival baseline) and showing **robustness** of “narrow target” conclusions\n- separating (i) outcome betterness ordering from (ii) act permissibility more explicitly, especially when using motivating gamble rhetoric\n\nAs written, the extinction anchor still looks like a substantive ethical choice that shapes the paper’s quantitative takeaways, not just a convenient normalization."
