  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real sub-argument in the position: the move from (i) preference engineering + adaptive satisfaction to (ii) \u201capproval doesn\u2019t track value,\u201d supporting the claim that even subjectively wonderful futures can be morally mediocre. However, this is only one supporting wedge among many (multiplicative fragility, population ethics, digital minds, bounded/unbounded \u2018fussy\u2019 value functions), so centrality is moderate-low. The objection has some bite: if preferences can be shaped, the paper should address why we wouldn\u2019t (or couldn\u2019t) also shape robust moral concern, which would reduce some moral-catastrophe risks and partially undermine the \u201cunnoticed mediocrity\u201d story. Still, it doesn\u2019t seriously touch the more structural arguments that eutopia is narrow because of moral-theoretic fussiness or combinatorial fragility across many dimensions; preference engineering could itself be one more dimension and may be captured by their \u2018navigation/steering\u2019 factors. The critique is mostly correct but makes a somewhat speculative leap that this would \u201cbroaden the target substantially\u201d without showing it overcomes the paper\u2019s broader reasons for fussiness. It is clear, focused on a single issue, and has little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Preference-Engineering Inversion\" \u2014 The paper argues that future beings could engineer preferences to be satisfied with \u201ctragically mediocre circumstances,\u201d so inhabitants won\u2019t detect lost value; hence moral catastrophe can coexist with universal approval. But this cuts both ways: if preference engineering is available, then *so is* engineering robust moral concern, empathy, and aversion to cruelty, potentially making certain catastrophic errors (e.g., factory-farming analogs for digital minds) far less likely than today. The paper uses malleability of preferences as a threat vector, yet doesn\u2019t integrate the symmetric possibility that value-aligned preference shaping is an unusually powerful steering force toward mostly-great futures. That\u2019s not a superficial optimism; it attacks the \u201capproval doesn\u2019t track value\u201d wedge the paper drives between subjective satisfaction and objective goodness. If the objection holds, the paper must argue that preference engineering is systematically more likely to entrench selfish or parochial equilibria than to amplify moral regard\u2014or else admit that the same technology broadens the eutopian target substantially.",
