  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s quantitative \u201cmeasurement backbone\u201d (extinction=0, best-feasible=1, and \u2018mostly-great\u2019>0.5 via 50\u201350 extinction/eutopia comparisons), which is used repeatedly in the essay\u2019s framing and especially in the moral-uncertainty/normalization discussion. So the attacked point is fairly central, though not fully load-bearing for every strand (the multiplicative-fragility and \u2018many ways to go wrong\u2019 case can be made more qualitatively). However, the critique only partly undermines the paper as written, because the paper explicitly restricts attention to moral views that satisfy VNM-style axioms over prospects (including an independence condition), which already bakes in comparability over lotteries; within that framework, using extinction as an anchor is more a representational/convenience choice than an endorsement of \u201cpermissible gambling with extinction.\u201d Relatedly, even if some deontological/rights-based views reject extinction-wagers as permissible, the paper can plausibly reply that the comparison is a counterfactual tool for cardinalization, or it can re-anchor the scale without changing the underlying \u2018fussiness\u2019 claims. Still, the objection correctly highlights that many non-consequentialist views won\u2019t accept the required axioms/lottery-based calibration, and that anchoring/normalization choices matter a lot\u2014so it\u2019s a real (but not decisive) pressure on the universality and interpretation of the 0.5/0.9 thresholds.",

  "text": "\"The Eutopia/Extinction Commensuration Leak\" \u2014 The paper argues that many moral views (including non-consequentialist ones) can be represented with a cardinal value function via VNM axioms, enabling claims like \u201ceutopia is twice as good as X if a 50\u201350 eutopia/extinction gamble is better than X.\u201d But for many non-consequentialist or rights-based views, extinction is not a mere low-value outcome; it changes which obligations exist and can collapse constraints, so \u201cgambling with extinction\u201d may not be a permissible comparator even if outcomes are rankable in some abstract sense. If extinction can\u2019t serve as the universal zero-point tradeoff partner, then the paper\u2019s operationalization of \u201cmostly-great = above 0.5\u201d becomes ethically unstable: you\u2019re measuring closeness to utopia by a forbidden wager. This is not a definitional nit; it strikes at the paper\u2019s measurement backbone, which it uses repeatedly (e.g., the \u201c60\u201340 gamble\u201d intuition, the normalization across moral uncertainty). If the objection holds, the paper must rebuild its quantitative comparisons without relying on extinction as a neutral calibrator\u2014likely changing what \u201cfussy\u201d even means in practice.",
