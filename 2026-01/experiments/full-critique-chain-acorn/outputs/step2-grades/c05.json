  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central methodological move: the paper\u2019s operationalization of \u201cfussiness\u201d via a probability distribution over futures conditional on survival and on there being no *additional* serious de dicto optimization pressure. If that conditional were illegitimate (i.e., it carved away the mechanisms that would normally steer toward good outcomes), then the paper\u2019s inference from \u2018low mostly-great probability under that distribution\u2019 to \u2018narrow target\u2019 would be weakened.\n\nHowever, the critique overstates what is being excluded. The paper does not exclude all de dicto value-driven institutions \u201cby default\u201d; it conditions on there being no *more serious* coordinated optimization for the very best outcomes than exists today. Since current societies already contain de dicto moral/institutional steering, the critique partly attacks a straw interpretation (\u201cmorally indifferent civilization that nonetheless achieves stunning competence\u201d). Also, the essay\u2019s broader case for fragility (many independent ways to go wrong; multiplicative-factor model; moral-view taxonomy) does not hinge entirely on that specific conditional, so refuting it wouldn\u2019t collapse the whole \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 thesis.\n\nNet: the critique is clear, focused, and raises a real modeling/conditioning worry, but it only moderately undermines the argument because it likely misreads the conditional and doesn\u2019t show that realistic endogenous moral optimization would make mostly-great futures common rather than still rare.",

  "text": "\"The De Dicto Smuggling Problem\" \u2014 The paper argues that, conditional on \u201cno serious optimisation pressure \u2026 to promote the very best outcomes de dicto,\u201d mostly-great futures are unlikely on fussy views, so the target is narrow. But \u201cde dicto\u201d exclusion quietly removes the main real-world channel by which good futures arise: agents optimize for what they take to be good under descriptions they endorse, which is exactly \u201cde dicto,\u201d and even \u201cby default\u201d institutions (science, rights, markets, democratic accountability) are de dicto in structure. Once you exclude de dicto optimization, you are no longer modeling \u201cdefault\u201d social evolution; you are modeling a bizarrely morally indifferent civilization that nonetheless achieves stunning competence. The paper\u2019s inference from that model to \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d is therefore hostage to an implausible conditional that strips away the very steering mechanisms that would broaden the target. If this holds, the paper must either defend that the de dicto exclusion approximates reality (despite moralized institutions), or rerun the argument under realistic endogenous moral optimization\u2014where the narrow-target claim is much harder to sustain.",
