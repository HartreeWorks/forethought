  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s normalization/benchmarking move (defining \u201cbest feasible\u201d via a high percentile and then setting it to 1, with \u201cmostly-great\u201d at >0.5), which is moderately central because many headline claims are comparative (\u201cmost futures fall far short of the best feasible\u201d). However, much of the paper\u2019s case for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d is not purely an artifact of that anchor: it also argues (i) qualitatively for many independent axes of moral failure, (ii) via a multiplicative/fragility model, and (iii) that many plausible value functions are intrinsically \u2018fussy\u2019 (e.g., linear/unbounded + fat-tailed value-efficiency) in ways that don\u2019t disappear just by changing the percentile used to approximate the near-max. The critique is partly correct that percentile-based anchoring is distribution-relative and can make \u201cwonderful\u201d futures look small compared to speculative tails, so some comparisons (e.g., common-sense utopia vs \u201cbest feasible\u201d) depend on how extreme the benchmark is. But it overstates by implying the conclusion is largely \u201cbuilt in\u201d: the benchmark is intended to represent near-max feasible value on a given moral view, and evaluating closeness-to-max is exactly the point of the argument. Clear and focused, with little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Percentile Anchor Trap\" \u2014 The paper argues that the intuitive oddity of preferring a 60\u201340 eutopia/extinction gamble over many \u201cwonderful\u201d futures supports \u201cno easy eutopia,\u201d because it normalizes value by stipulating v(best feasible future)=1 at the 99.99th percentile and v(extinction)=0. But that percentile anchor silently builds the conclusion into the scale: if the 99.99th percentile is defined relative to a distribution that already includes extreme, theory-driven \u201cbest uses\u201d (e.g., maximally efficient bliss or galaxy tiling), then almost any humane, stable future is forced to look like \u201c<0.5.\u201d This makes \u201cfussiness\u201d partly an artifact of where you place the 1, not a discovery about what futures are intrinsically near-best. The objection bites because many of the later \u201clinear views are fussy\u201d results depend on comparing \u201ccommon-sense utopia\u201d to a benchmark whose extremity is distribution-relative rather than normatively justified. If this holds, the paper would need a non\u2013percentile-based grounding for the 1-point (e.g., a principled ceiling independent of a speculative tail), or else the central comparative claims about \u201cmostly-great is rare\u201d lose their force.",
