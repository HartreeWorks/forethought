  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s moral-uncertainty/intertheoretic-comparison discussion, arguing that letting unbounded views \u201cloom large\u201d yields Pascalian tail-dominance and practical action-guidance failure unless an anti-Pascalian constraint is added. This is a meaningful pressure on one route by which the paper motivates \u2018fussiness in practice\u2019 and how moral uncertainty might amplify the no-easy-eutopia takeaway, but it is not the core of the overall position (which also relies heavily on the independent \u2018eutopia is fragile / multiplicative factors\u2019 case). Hence moderate centrality. The objection has some bite: unbounded/dominance worries are a known pathology and the paper\u2019s own list of weird possibilities makes the vulnerability salient. However, it somewhat overstates what the paper is committed to (the paper flags intertheoretic comparisons as thorny and does not straightforwardly recommend deferring to the weirdest tail), and the position can likely be patched by adopting a permissibility/robustness stance or a principled bounded-utility/lexicality constraint without obviously collapsing the main \u2018targets are narrow\u2019 thesis. So strength is modest rather than high. The critique is mostly accurate in identifying a risk, but its \u2018perpetual deference/paralysis\u2019 framing is stronger than what strictly follows from the text, lowering correctness slightly. It is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Moral-Uncertainty Aggregation Backfire\" \u2014 The paper argues that under plausible intertheoretic comparison methods (variance normalization, pairwise), unbounded views often loom large, making decision-making \u201cfussy in practice.\u201d But that conclusion threatens to collapse into a decision-theoretic pathology: if unbounded views dominate under uncertainty, then almost any policy becomes hostage to speculative tails (infinite value, acausal trade, simulation bargaining), which the paper itself lists as possible \u201cstrange\u201d issues\u2014precisely the ones that make the space unmanageable. In effect, the paper\u2019s attempt to be systematic about fussiness produces an action-guidance failure where the recommended stance is perpetual deference to the weirdest-seeming live possibility. That\u2019s not merely counterintuitive; it undermines the paper\u2019s implied practical moral: that we should take \u201cbetter futures\u201d work seriously in a grounded way, rather than spiraling into Pascalian paralysis. If the objection holds, the paper must add a principled anti-Pascalian constraint (beyond \u201cthorny\u201d), and then re-check whether the \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion survives once tail-dominance is curtailed.",
