  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key step in the paper\u2019s Section 3 case that many plausible moral views (especially unbounded linear ones) make mostly-great futures a narrow target: the move from linear/separable value to the claim that resources must be used in \u201cvery specific\u201d ways. If that step failed, the paper\u2019s systematic sweep would be materially weakened, though not fully overturned because the broader \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d thesis also relies on earlier multiplicative-fragility/moral-catastrophe considerations. The critique has moderate strength: it plausibly shows that linearity/separability alone does not force a needle-like optimum; it is compatible with many near-maximizing \u201ctiles\u201d (a plateau) that could broaden the target. However, the paper does not rely on linearity alone; it explicitly adds a fat-tailed value-efficiency premise and argues there is (at some granularity) a best arrangement to replicate. The critique under-engages these added premises, and somewhat overstates the paper as requiring a single maximizer rather than a small/highly selective set. Still, it correctly flags an under-justified inference: the paper needs more defense that high-efficiency configurations are rare rather than abundant/robust. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The Linear-Separability Equivocation\" \u2014 The paper argues that unbounded linear views are separable across resource parcels, therefore require using \u201cmost accessible resources\u201d and using them in \u201cvery specific\u201d ways, making mostly-great futures a narrow target. But the step from linearity to \u201cvery specific use\u201d relies on treating the value-efficiency landscape as dominated by a single maximizer (or a tiny set), whereas linear separability more naturally supports a large space of near-maximizers repeated across parcels (many locally optimal \u201ctiles\u201d), especially if value arises from diverse flourishing rather than a single engineered experience. In that case, linearity doesn\u2019t imply specificity; it implies replicability, and replicability can make the target broad if there\u2019s a wide plateau of high-efficiency tiles. This matters because the paper\u2019s \u201clinear views are fussy\u201d claim does enormous work in Section 3\u2019s systematic sweep. If the objection holds, the paper must justify why the high-value region is needle-like rather than plateau-like (and why diversity/robustness considerations don\u2019t create many near-maximal tiles), or else linearity ceases to entail fussiness.",
