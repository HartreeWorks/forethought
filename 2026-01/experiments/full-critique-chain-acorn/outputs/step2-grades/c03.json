  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key move in the paper\u2019s intuitive case for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d: that even conditioning on something like the paper\u2019s \u201ccommon-sense utopia\u201d (high stability, competence, low suffering), there remain many largely-independent ways to miss most value, so mostly-great futures are rare. If downstream moral-error risk is strongly reduced by conditioning on those upstream achievements, then the paper\u2019s inference from \u201cmany ways to be wrong\u201d to \u201crarely mostly-great, even given abundance\u201d is weakened, so the attacked point is fairly central (though not fully, since the later technical \u2018fussy value function\u2019 argument can still support narrow-target conclusions). The argument is moderately strong: it correctly highlights an implicit (or at least under-argued) independence/robustness assumption, and presses for a mechanism rather than historical analogy. However it doesn\u2019t show the assumption is false, only that it needs support; the paper could reply that the upstream properties don\u2019t guarantee moral reflection/rights recognition, or that certain blind spots are structurally persistent, so the critique is more of a challenge than a refutation. It is mostly correct, clear, focused, and contains little filler.",

  "text": "\"Upstream-Competence Dominance\" \u2014 The paper argues that \u201ccommon-sense utopia\u201d can still be morally catastrophic, because specific downstream choices (digital being rights, population ethics, etc.) can go badly without making inhabitants discontented. But the same scenario description builds in unusually high upstream competence: \u201cscientific understanding and technological progress move ahead, without endangering the world,\u201d \u201ccollaboration and bargaining replace war,\u201d and \u201cminimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings.\u201d Those are not mere background conditions; they are exactly the sort of epistemic and institutional achievements that, if real, would also make catastrophic downstream moral blind spots less likely than the paper treats them. The paper\u2019s inference from \u201chere are many ways to be wrong\u201d to \u201cmostly-great is rare even under abundance\u201d depends on treating downstream moral error probability as roughly stable even as you condition on extreme upstream success. If this holds, the paper must argue that there are robust mechanisms by which advanced, stable, low-suffering societies systematically preserve deep moral errors (not just \u201cit happened historically\u201d), or else the \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion becomes a non sequitur from a conditional you\u2019ve already strengthened beyond recognition.",
