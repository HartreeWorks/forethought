So centrality is moderate-low. The objection is moderately strong against the specific inference: moral pluralism/disagreement can indeed be evidence that \u2018catastrophe\u2019 labels are easy to generate and thus shouldn\u2019t strongly update you toward \u201cnarrow target\u201d claims without an account of which moral views are epistemically/live-weighted. However, the paper can partially sidestep this because it can treat the list as an existence proof of plausible-seeming large moral errors, not as a probabilistic inference from disagreement to likely error; and because the overall fussiness conclusion is overdetermined by other independent arguments. Most of the critique is conceptually correct and clearly stated, with little fluff, and it stays focused on one issue. Overall it modestly weakens one strand of the argument but does not seriously threaten the full position.",

  "text": "\"The Moral-Catastrophe Gish Gallop\" \u2014 The paper argues that eutopia is a narrow target because across many moral perspectives (religious, conservative, pro-life, socialist, environmentalist, animal welfare), the present is judged deeply flawed, suggesting \u201cnon-obvious but severe flaws are the norm.\u201d The hidden crux is that this treats \u201cmany incompatible moral perspectives can label something catastrophic\u201d as evidence that the thing is likely far from the moral optimum, but that inference reverses under a plausible meta-epistemic view: widespread disagreement is evidence that \u201ccatastrophe\u201d judgments are cheaply generated by value-laden framings, not that reality is near-maximally flawed. In other words, the paper uses pluralism to argue for fragility, but pluralism also supports the opposite: that \u201ccatastrophe\u201d is not a stable signal and therefore should not update you strongly toward narrow-target pessimism. This is hard to route around because Sections 2.1\u20132.3 use the cross-view \u201ccatastrophe\u201d rhetoric to set the emotional and epistemic baseline for fussiness. If the objection holds, the paper needs a discrimination principle that filters which moral frameworks are \u201clive\u201d in a way that doesn\u2019t smuggle in the conclusion (and then show that, among those, catastrophic moral error remains likely).",
