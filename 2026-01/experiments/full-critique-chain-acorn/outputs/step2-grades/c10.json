  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific (and rhetorically salient) step in Section 3.3: the \u20181 in 10^22 bad resources\u2019 example used to argue that separately-aggregating bounded views are still extremely fussy because tiny fractions of bad scale to large absolute bad. That supports the paper\u2019s broader claim that many bounded views are fussy, but it is only one pillar among several (e.g., linear/unbounded arguments, multiplicative fragility, other paths to fussiness), so centrality is moderate rather than high. The objection has real force: the paper\u2019s inference from \u201cfraction of resources\u201d to \u201cmoral magnitude\u201d does rely on an extensiveness/commensurability assumption, and many of the paper\u2019s own candidate \u2018bads\u2019 (rights/ownership/injustice/death) plausibly behave more like relational/threshold wrongs than continuously extensive quantities. Still, the paper can likely reply by restricting the 10^22 argument to extensive bads (notably suffering) or by arguing that relational wrongs replicated across many sites still generate extensive disvalue, so the critique weakens the example and some generality, but doesn\u2019t fully overturn the bounded-views-fussiness claim. The critique is mostly correct, clear, focused, and has little dead weight.",

  "text": "\"The One-in-10^22 Rhetoric Mistakes Extensiveness for Intensity\" \u2014 The paper argues that on separately aggregating bounded views, using \u201cone resource in 10^22\u201d for bads prevents a mostly-great future, because in a cosmic expansion that still amounts to a star system\u2019s worth of bad. But that conclusion depends on assuming \u201cbadness\u201d scales extensively with resources in a morally homogeneous way, while many of the paper\u2019s own motivating examples (e.g., rights violations, ownership, death, injustice) are not extensive in that sense: the moral gravity is often about *relations*, *institutions*, or *types of wrongdoing*, not the volume of matter processed. A star system of mild unfairness is not obviously commensurate with a star system of severe torture, and the model\u2019s conversion of \u201cfraction of resources\u201d into \u201cmoral magnitude\u201d collapses crucial structure. The point matters because the \u201ctiny fraction of bad blocks mostly-great\u201d result is a central pillar in Section 3\u2019s claim that bounded views are fussy too. If the objection holds, the paper must justify the extensiveness assumption for bads (and goods) across cosmic scale, or else re-derive fussiness under a relational/threshold conception of wrongs\u2014where the 10^22 argument may fail.",
