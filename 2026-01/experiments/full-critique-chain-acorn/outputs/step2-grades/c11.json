  "reasoning": "The critique targets one illustrative \u201cmoral catastrophe\u201d mechanism in \u00a72.3.2 (digital beings get full rights \u2192 become voting majority \u2192 human values lose). That example is a flagship illustration, but the paper\u2019s overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion is supported by many other independent examples plus the later technical argument about bounded/unbounded value functions; so even fully defusing this scenario would only modestly weaken the overall case (moderate-low centrality).\n\nOn the attacked sub-claim, the critique has fair force: the paper\u2019s \u2018catastrophe via outvoting\u2019 story does lean on (i) divergence between digital-majority choices and \u2018human-values\u2019 views and (ii) an institutional setup where numerical majority readily implies broad control. Pointing out that competent societies can adopt constitutional/federal/rights-protecting institutions that prevent \u201cfast-growing constituency \u21d2 total control\u201d substantially undercuts the scenario as a default/predictable failure mode, unless the paper adds structural reasons enfranchisement tends to produce value drift. However, the paper only needs the possibility/plausibility of large moral error, not strict inevitability, and it already lists multiple routes to \u201cgetting it wrong\u201d (motivated cognition, wrong moral beliefs, political capture). So the critique weakens the example but doesn\u2019t fully refute the paper\u2019s broader claim that digital-being governance is a high-stakes, non-obvious axis where moral error is easy.\n\nMost statements in the critique are plausible/true as conditional claims about institutional design, though the \u2018background competence\u2019 allegation is somewhat contestable (one can stably grant rights yet still mishandle representation/power transitions). The critique is clear, focused, and contains little filler.",

  "text": "\"The Digital Majority Scarecrow\" \u2014 The paper argues that even giving digital beings full rights can be catastrophic because they could outvote humans, and on views that prize \u201chuman values,\u201d that loses almost everything worthwhile. But that inference tacitly assumes (i) digital beings\u2019 preferences will systematically diverge from humane values, and (ii) democratic aggregation is the governance baseline, rather than constitutional, federal, or rights-protecting structures that decouple population share from value lock-in. In a world competent enough to stably grant rights to radically new moral patients, the institutional response to \u201cfast-growing constituency\u201d is precisely to design representation and rights so that \u201cnumerical majority\u201d does not equal \u201ctotal control,\u201d so the scenario\u2019s catastrophe mechanism conflicts with the background competence the paper keeps presupposing. This matters because \u201cdigital beings\u201d is one of the paper\u2019s flagship examples of non-obvious moral catastrophe within common-sense utopia. If the objection holds, the paper must show that there are *structural* reasons why digital enfranchisement predictably causes value drift (not merely that it\u2019s imaginable), or else this example stops supporting the claim that the eutopian target is narrow by default.",
