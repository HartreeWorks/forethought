  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real support-beam of Section 2 (the historical-moral-catastrophe intuition pump used to motivate \"eutopian fragility\"), but it does not engage the essay\u2019s broader case (multiplicative-value model, population ethics/digital beings examples, and especially the Section 3 analysis about bounded/unbounded value functions and fussiness). So the attacked claim is moderately central rather than load-bearing for the entire position. The objection has moderate strength: it plausibly shows the historical evidence cuts both ways (moral blindness vs. correction via reflection/institutions) and thus that the essay may over-weight history as evidence for persistent, non-obvious future catastrophe. However, it doesn\u2019t actually establish that improved institutions make the eutopian target wide by default; it mainly forces the essay to justify why future errors won\u2019t be corrected (or will be harder to detect), which weakens but doesn\u2019t refute the argument. The critique\u2019s empirical/historical claims are broadly reasonable (abolition/rights expansions as evidence of correction mechanisms), though somewhat idealized, hence high but not perfect correctness. It is clear, focused on one core point, and contains little fluff.",

  "text": "\"The Reversal from Historical Moral Progress\" \u2014 The paper argues that because historical societies confidently endorsed slavery, subjugation, etc., we should expect future societies to harbor non-obvious moral catastrophes, implying eutopia is fragile. But the same historical record also supports a reversal: many societies did, eventually, correct those errors through institutionalized critique (abolition movements, rights expansion, scientific understanding of suffering), suggesting that once a civilization reaches high literacy, pluralism, and stable prosperity\u2014the very preconditions of the paper\u2019s common-sense utopia\u2014the default trajectory is *toward* moral correction, not persistent catastrophe. The paper treats \u201cit wasn\u2019t obvious then\u201d as evidence of likely future blindness, but you could instead treat \u201cwe can look back and see it now\u201d as evidence that reflection mechanisms work and widen the target over time. This is hard to route around because Section 2.1 is a foundational intuition pump: it\u2019s meant to make \u201cnon-obvious catastrophe\u201d feel normal rather than exceptional. If the objection holds, the paper must argue that future moral errors will be systematically harder to detect than past ones even under improved reflection\u2014otherwise history is ambiguous and cannot bear the weight placed on it.",
