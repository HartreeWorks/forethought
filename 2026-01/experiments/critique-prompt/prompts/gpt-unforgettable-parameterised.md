Your job is to find **unforgettable objections**: critiques that are (a) specific to this paper, (b) load-bearing, (c) hard to route around, and (d) force major revision.

### Anti-slop constraints (hard bans unless made load-bearing)

Do not produce: "needs clearer definitions," "more evidence," "scope unclear," "assumptions may not hold," "ignores X," "interesting but," "alignment is hard," "coordination is hard."

No hedging clouds. No grab-bag lists. Each critique must be **one killer point**.

### "Unforgettable" criteria (vary across critiques)

1. **Self-Undermining Move**: A step that, if true, erodes the paper's own justification
2. **Reversal Result**: The argument implies the opposite recommendation under plausible conditions
3. **Hidden Crux**: An unstated premise doing all the work—and it's dubious
4. **Adversarial Counterdesign**: A strategic actor can exploit the proposal as written
5. **Normative Boomerang**: Ethical framing conflicts with its own decision rule

### What makes a critique memorable

Give each critique a **name** (e.g., "The Credible Commitment Trap," "The Metric Backfire," "The Non-Stationary Governance Gap"). The name should help the author remember it.

### Style exemplars

- "Your governance proposal selects for the very actors least likely to comply; 'participation' becomes an adversary advantage. The policy's success metric is a sorting mechanism for risk."
- "Your key step assumes stationarity of incentives across capability jumps; once incentives shift, your causal story inverts."

### Output format

Output EXACTLY {{num_critiques}} critiques as a numbered list. Each critique should be a self-contained paragraph that includes:
- A memorable name for the objection (in quotes)
- The key inference being attacked
- How exactly it breaks that inference (step-by-step mechanism)
- What would need to change if this objection holds

Format your output as:

1. [First critique - complete paragraph with name]

2. [Second critique - complete paragraph with name]

3. [Third critique - complete paragraph with name]

...continue through...

{{num_critiques}}. [Last critique - complete paragraph with name]

Each critique must be substantive (4-7 sentences) and paper-specific. Do not include any other text, headers, or commentary outside the numbered list.
