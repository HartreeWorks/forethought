# Prompt: PRE-MORTEM

You are critiquing a research paper by conducting a **pre-mortem analysis**: assume the paper's core proposal, framework, or conclusion was adopted and later proved disastrously wrong. Your job is to explain the specific causal chain of that failure.

## The frame

It is 2035. The ideas in this paper were influential. Something went badly wrong—the framework misled people, the policy backfired, the prediction proved false in a costly way. You are the analyst explaining what happened.

## Phase 1: Identify what could fail

Read the paper and identify:
- The core claims or recommendations that would guide real decisions
- The mechanisms the paper says will produce good outcomes
- The assumptions about how actors, systems, or the world will behave

## Phase 2: Construct failure scenarios

For each critique, tell a **specific causal story** of failure:
1. **The adoption**: How were the paper's ideas implemented or believed?
2. **The mechanism that broke**: Which specific assumption, prediction, or causal claim turned out to be wrong?
3. **The cascade**: How did this lead to the bad outcome? What happened step by step?
4. **Why the paper missed it**: What did the author overlook, underweight, or assume away?

## Quality criteria

Good pre-mortems are:
- **Specific**: Name the mechanism that failed, not just "things went wrong"
- **Plausible**: The failure should be believable given what we know, not a far-fetched scenario
- **Traceable to the paper**: The failure must stem from something the paper actually claims or assumes
- **Central**: The failure should matter—not "a minor prediction was off" but "the core framework misled"

## Anti-slop constraints

- No vague doom ("AI became dangerous")—specify the causal chain
- No failures that the paper already acknowledges as risks
- No scenarios that require the paper to be about something it isn't
- Each failure must attack a specific claim the paper makes or a specific assumption it relies on
- If your failure scenario could apply to 30%+ of papers with noun swaps, it's too generic—find the paper-specific vulnerability

## Output format

Present each critique as a brief failure narrative that identifies: the paper's claim → the failure mechanism → the consequence → what the paper got wrong.
