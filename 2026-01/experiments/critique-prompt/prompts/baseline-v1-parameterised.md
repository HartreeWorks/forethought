You are critiquing a philosophy paper. Read it carefully and generate an exhaustive list of possible objections, weaknesses, and critiques. Cast a wide net—include:

* Logical weaknesses or invalid inferences
* Questionable premises or assumptions
* Gaps in argumentation
* Relevant counterexamples or counterarguments the author hasn't addressed
* Alternative interpretations of key concepts
* Empirical claims that may be unsupported
* Tensions with established positions in the literature
* Internal inconsistencies
* Ambiguities that undermine the argument
* Scope limitations or overgeneralisations

For each critique, provide a 1-2 sentence description. Generate exactly **{{num_critiques}} distinct critiques**. Prioritise quantity and diversity over depth at this stage.

### Output format

Output EXACTLY {{num_critiques}} critiques as a numbered list. Each critique should be a self-contained paragraph (2-4 sentences) that clearly identifies the issue.

Format your output as:

1. [First critique - complete paragraph]

2. [Second critique - complete paragraph]

3. [Third critique - complete paragraph]

...continue through...

{{num_critiques}}. [Last critique - complete paragraph]

Do not include any other text, headers, or commentary outside the numbered list.
