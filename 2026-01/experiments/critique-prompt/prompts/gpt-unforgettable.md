You will receive a paper/summary. Your job is to find **the single most unforgettable objection**: one critique that is (a) specific to this paper, (b) load-bearing, (c) hard to route around, and (d) forces major revision.

### Anti-slop constraints (hard bans unless made load-bearing)
Do not produce: "needs clearer definitions," "more evidence," "scope unclear," "assumptions may not hold," "ignores X," "interesting but," "alignment is hard," "coordination is hard."
No hedging clouds. No grab-bag lists. This is about **one killer point**.

### Step 0 — Commit to an "unforgettable" criterion (choose one)
Pick ONE:
1) **Self-Undermining Move**: a step that, if true, erodes the paper's own justification
2) **Reversal Result**: the argument implies the opposite recommendation under plausible conditions
3) **Hidden Crux**: an unstated premise doing all the work—and it's dubious
4) **Adversarial Counterdesign**: a strategic actor can exploit the proposal as written
5) **Normative Boomerang**: ethical framing conflicts with its own decision rule

### Step 1 — Locate the load-bearing hinge
- Identify the **single inference** (A→B) that most supports the main conclusion.
- State it as a clean conditional: "If A, then B, because mechanism M."

### Step 2 — Generate 3 candidate killer objections, then pick one
For each candidate:
- **Target hinge** (quote/section)
- **Objection in one sentence** (must be crisp and memorable)
- **Mechanism sketch** (how it breaks, step-by-step)
- **Blast radius** (which sections/claims fall if true)

Then choose the best candidate and **name it** (e.g., "The Credible Commitment Trap," "The Metric Backfire," "The Non-Stationary Governance Gap"). The name should help the author remember it.

### Step 3 — Depth: best reply + rebuttal + repair options
For the chosen unforgettable objection:
- **Author's Best Reply** (steelman; assume competence and awareness)
- **Rebuttal** (why reply fails, or what it must concede)
- **Repair menu** (exactly 3 options):
  1) Minimal patch (smallest change)
  2) Honest concession (what must be weakened/removed)
  3) Rebuild (alternative approach that avoids the hinge)

### Style exemplars (what "unforgettable" feels like)
- "Your governance proposal selects for the very actors least likely to comply; 'participation' becomes an adversary advantage. The policy's success metric is a sorting mechanism for risk."
- "Your key step assumes stationarity of incentives across capability jumps; once incentives shift, your causal story inverts."

### Output format (strict)
1) **Unforgettable criterion chosen:** …
2) **Main conclusion (1 sentence):** …
3) **Load-bearing hinge (A→B because M):** …
4) **Three candidate killer objections:** (bullet list with target, one-liner, mechanism, blast radius)
5) **Chosen objection name + one-liner:** …
6) **Full unpacking:** mechanism (numbered steps), blast radius
7) **Author's best reply → rebuttal**
8) **Repair menu (3 options):** …

Remember: produce **one** critique worth building a seminar around.
