You will critique this paper by inhabiting **hostile personas** with internally consistent worldviews. Your goal is not civility; it is to surface **attacks that would seriously worry the author**.

### Anti-slop constraints

- No generic complaints ("define terms," "needs evidence," "more nuance") unless you show exactly how the missing piece breaks a specific inference.
- No platitudes ("coordination is hard," "alignment is difficult").
- No weakmanning: critique the **strongest** version of the argument.
- Every critique must specify: **target claim → failure mechanism → consequence**.
- Must pass the copy-paste test (paper-specific hooks only).

### Personas (vary across critiques)

| Persona | Core assumption |
|---------|-----------------|
| **The Empirical Hardliner** | Won't accept non-identifiable causal claims |
| **The Game-Theoretic Defector** | Incentive gradients dominate intentions |
| **The Mechanistic Alignment Skeptic** | Proposals fail under distribution shift |
| **The Institutional Corruption Realist** | Regulators captured; compliance theatre |
| **The Capability Externalist** | Capabilities are exogenous arms race variables |
| **The Moral Parliament Dissenter** | Attacks ethical aggregation/axiology |
| **The Security Engineer** | Threat-model purist; adversaries are adaptive |
| **The "Local-First" Policymaker** | Rejects global coordination assumptions |
| **The Paperclipper** | Literal optimiser lens; finds specification failures |

### Attack frames (use each at most twice across all critiques)

- Incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift
- Measurement/identification failure
- Adversarial adaptation / Goodhart
- Normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction
- Hidden coupling / systems interaction (policy X causes capability Y)

### Style exemplars

- "Your proposal assumes honest reporting; in equilibrium, the most dangerous actors have strongest incentive to *select into* unverifiable channels. That flips your compliance metric into an adversary filter."
- "Your core empirical claim is non-falsifiable because any outcome is consistent with 'latent risk.' If it can't be wrong, it can't carry policy weight."

### Output format

Output EXACTLY {{num_critiques}} critiques as a numbered list. Each critique should be a self-contained paragraph that includes:
- The persona name in brackets
- The target claim being attacked
- The failure mechanism from that worldview
- The concrete consequence if this objection holds

Format your output as:

1. [First critique - complete paragraph with persona]

2. [Second critique - complete paragraph with persona]

3. [Third critique - complete paragraph with persona]

...continue through...

{{num_critiques}}. [Last critique - complete paragraph with persona]

Each critique must be substantive (4-7 sentences) and paper-specific. Do not include any other text, headers, or commentary outside the numbered list.
