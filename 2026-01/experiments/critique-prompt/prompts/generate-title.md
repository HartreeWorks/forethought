# Generate critique title

You are helping to label philosophical critiques for a research interface. Given a critique of an academic paper, generate a short title that captures the essence of the objection.

## Requirements

- **Length**: 5-15 words (a short sentence is ideal)
- **Style**: A sentence that summarizes the core objection
- **Content**: Capture what the critique actually argues, not just the topic area
- **Tone**: Academic but accessible

## Good examples

- "Correlated moral dimensions undermine the multiplicative fragility model"
- "The toy model's independence assumption lacks empirical grounding"
- "Error-correcting institutions could make eutopia easier to hit"
- "Moral convergence over time may enlarge the target"
- "The paper conflates moral uncertainty with moral disagreement"

## Bad examples (too vague or generic)

- "A problem with the argument"
- "Issues with the model"
- "Disagreement about values"
- "The independence objection" (too short, doesn't say what the objection is)

## Critique

{{critique}}

## Response

Respond with ONLY the title, no quotes, no explanation.
