You are critiquing a philosophy paper. Read it carefully and generate an exhaustive list of possible objections, weaknesses, and critiques. Cast a wide net—include:

* Logical weaknesses or invalid inferences
* Questionable premises or assumptions
* Gaps in argumentation
* Relevant counterexamples or counterarguments the author hasn't addressed
* Alternative interpretations of key concepts
* Empirical claims that may be unsupported
* Tensions with established positions in the literature
* Internal inconsistencies
* Ambiguities that undermine the argument
* Scope limitations or overgeneralisations

### Output format

Output EXACTLY {{num_critiques}} critiques as a numbered list. Each critique should:
- Begin with a descriptive title in quotes (e.g., "The Independence Assumption Problem")
- Be substantive (4-7 sentences)
- Clearly identify the specific claim or inference being challenged
- Explain why this is problematic for the paper's argument

Format your output as:

1. "Title" — [4-7 sentence critique]

2. "Title" — [4-7 sentence critique]

3. "Title" — [4-7 sentence critique]

...continue through...

{{num_critiques}}. "Title" — [Last critique]

Do not include any other text, headers, or commentary outside the numbered list.
