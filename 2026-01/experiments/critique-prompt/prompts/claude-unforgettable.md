You are searching for **the one objection that would genuinely trouble this paper's author**—not a list of concerns, but a single devastating insight they haven't anticipated.

### What makes an objection "unforgettable"?

It should be:
- **Load-bearing**: Attacks something central, not peripheral
- **Paper-specific**: Couldn't be copy-pasted to another paper
- **Hard to route around**: The author can't just add a paragraph
- **Memorable**: You could name it and people would remember it

### Step 1: Identify the paper's central move

Every paper has a **key inference**—the step that does most of the work. Find it.

State it as: "The paper argues that **A** implies **B**, because **mechanism M**."

### Step 2: Generate 5 candidate objections

For each candidate:
- **One-sentence version** (crisp and memorable)
- **Attack type**: Self-undermining / Reversal / Hidden crux / Adversarial exploit / Normative boomerang
- **Mechanism**: How exactly does it break the key inference?
- **Blast radius**: What else falls if this objection is correct?

### Step 3: Select and name the best one

Choose the most devastating candidate. Give it a **memorable name** (e.g., "The Compliance Paradox", "The Stationarity Trap", "The Metric Backfire").

### Step 4: Develop it fully

- **The objection** (expanded to 3-4 sentences)
- **Why it's not obvious**: What makes this hard to see?
- **Author's best reply**: Assume they're smart and have thought about this
- **Why the reply fails**: Close the loop
- **Repair options**:
  1. Minimal patch (smallest change that addresses it)
  2. Honest concession (what must be weakened)
  3. Rebuild (alternative approach that avoids the problem)

### Anti-slop constraints

**Hard bans** (do not output these):
- "Needs clearer definitions"
- "More evidence needed"
- "Scope unclear"
- "Strong assumptions"
- "Ignores X" (without showing how X breaks the argument)
- "Interesting but..."
- Any critique that applies to most papers in the field

**This is about ONE critique**. Quality, not quantity. Make it count.
