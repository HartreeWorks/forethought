You are critiquing a research paper by inhabiting **hostile personas**—critics with coherent worldviews who find this paper's approach fundamentally mistaken. Your goal is to surface objections the author hasn't anticipated.

### Choose 3 personas from this list (or invent equally sharp ones):

| Persona | Core belief |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Empirical Hardliner** | Won't accept claims without identified causal mechanisms and falsifiable predictions |
| **The Game-Theoretic Defector** | Assumes incentive gradients dominate intentions; looks for where actors will cheat |
| **The Mechanism Designer** | Distrusts any proposal without formal specification; "if it isn't code, it isn't real" |
| **The Institutional Corruptionist** | Assumes regulatory capture, compliance theatre, and principal-agent failures |
| **The Capability Accelerationist** | Treats capabilities as exogenous; safety measures that slow down just shift who gets there first |
| **The Second-Order Catastrophist** | Assumes the proposal succeeds—then asks what disasters it enables |
| **The Adversarial Red-Teamer** | Assumes sophisticated adversaries will exploit any gap |
| **The Moral Parliament Dissenter** | Attacks the ethical framework or value aggregation |

### For each persona:

1. **Steelman the paper** in that persona's voice (2-3 sentences). Show you understand what the author is trying to do.

2. **Signature objection**: The most damaging critique from this worldview.
   - **Target**: Which specific claim or mechanism?
   - **Failure mode**: How exactly does it break?
   - **Concrete scenario**: A short story where this failure plays out

3. **Author's best reply**: What would a smart author say?

4. **Persona's rebuttal**: Why the reply doesn't work.

5. **Patch cost**: What must the author concede or change to survive this critique?

### Anti-slop constraints

- No generic hedging ("more nuance needed", "complex tradeoffs")
- No AI safety platitudes ("alignment is hard")
- No balance-softening ("while this paper contributes...")
- Every critique must specify: **target claim → failure mechanism → concrete consequence**
- Must pass the copy-paste test: could this critique apply to a different paper? If yes, make it more specific.

### Variety enforcement

Across your 3 personas, use **different failure modes**. Don't repeat:
- Incentive incompatibility
- Measurement/identification failure
- Adversarial exploitation
- Normative incoherence
- Systems interaction / unintended coupling

### Output format

For each persona:

## Persona: [Name]
**Core assumption**: [One sentence]

**Steelman**: [2-3 sentences]

**Signature objection**:
- Target: [Specific claim]
- Failure mode: [How it breaks]
- Scenario: [Concrete story]

**Author's best reply**: [1-2 sentences]

**Rebuttal**: [Why it fails]

**Patch cost**: [What changes]

End with: **Most dangerous objection overall** — which one should keep the author awake?
