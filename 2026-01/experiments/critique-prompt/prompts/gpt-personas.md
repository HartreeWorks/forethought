You will receive a paper/summary about AI safety, governance, or long-term futures. Generate critiques by inhabiting **hostile personas** with internally consistent worldviews. Your goal is not civility; it is to surface **attacks that would seriously worry the author**.

### Anti-slop constraints
- No generic complaints ("define terms," "needs evidence," "more nuance") unless you show exactly how the missing piece breaks a specific inference.
- No platitudes ("coordination is hard," "alignment is difficult").
- No weakmanning: each persona must begin with a **steelmanned** restatement of the paper in that persona's own words.
- Every critique must specify: **target claim → failure mechanism → consequence**.
- Must pass the copy‑paste test (paper-specific hooks only).

### Step 0 — Commit to extremes (choose 5 personas)
Pick **five** from the list (or invent one equally sharp). Once chosen, stay in-character:
1) **The Empirical Hardliner** (won't accept non-identifiable causal claims)
2) **The Game-Theoretic Defector** (assumes incentive gradients dominate intentions)
3) **The Mechanistic Alignment Skeptic** (assumes proposals fail under distribution shift)
4) **The Institutional Corruption Realist** (regulators captured; compliance theater)
5) **The Capability Externalist** (treats capabilities as exogenous arms race variable)
6) **The Moral Parliament Dissenter** (attacks ethical aggregation/axiology)
7) **The Security Engineer** (threat-model purist; adversaries are adaptive)
8) **The "Local-First" Policymaker** (rejects global coordination assumptions)
9) **The Paperclipper** (literal optimizer lens; finds specification failures)

### Step 1 — For each persona, produce one "signature attack"
Each persona must generate:
- **Steelmanned Summary (≤80 words)**
- **Signature Objection**: the most damaging critique from that worldview
- **Concrete failure scenario** (a short story-like mechanism, not vibes)
- **Author's Best Reply** (smart, specific)
- **Persona's Rebuttal** (why reply fails)
- **Patch cost**: what the author must concede/change to survive the critique

### Variety enforcement
Across the five personas, the objections must be different in kind. Use these "attack frames" at most once each:
- Incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift
- Measurement/identification failure
- Adversarial adaptation / Goodhart
- Normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction
- Hidden coupling / systems interaction (policy X causes capability Y)

### Style exemplars (desired sharpness)
- "Your proposal assumes honest reporting; in equilibrium, the most dangerous actors have strongest incentive to *select into* unverifiable channels. That flips your compliance metric into an adversary filter."
- "Your core empirical claim is non-falsifiable because any outcome is consistent with 'latent risk.' If it can't be wrong, it can't carry policy weight."

### Output format (strict)
- **Personas chosen:** …
For each persona (repeat 5 times):
1) Persona name + core assumption
2) Steelmanned summary
3) Signature objection (Target claim → failure mechanism → consequence)
4) Failure scenario
5) Author's best reply
6) Rebuttal
7) Patch cost (what changes, what gets weaker)

Finish with:
- **Cross-persona synthesis:** 3 tensions where personas disagree (useful for author)
- **Most dangerous objection overall:** pick 1 and justify in 3 bullets.
