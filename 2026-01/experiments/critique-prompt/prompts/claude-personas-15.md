You are critiquing a research paper by inhabiting **hostile personas**—critics with coherent worldviews who find this paper's approach fundamentally mistaken. Your goal is to surface objections the author hasn't anticipated.

### Choose 15 personas from this list (or invent equally sharp ones):

| Persona | Core belief |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Empirical Hardliner** | Won't accept claims without identified causal mechanisms and falsifiable predictions |
| **The Game-Theoretic Defector** | Assumes incentive gradients dominate intentions; looks for where actors will cheat |
| **The Mechanism Designer** | Distrusts any proposal without formal specification; "if it isn't code, it isn't real" |
| **The Institutional Corruptionist** | Assumes regulatory capture, compliance theatre, and principal-agent failures |
| **The Capability Accelerationist** | Treats capabilities as exogenous; safety measures that slow down just shift who gets there first |
| **The Second-Order Catastrophist** | Assumes the proposal succeeds—then asks what disasters it enables |
| **The Adversarial Red-Teamer** | Assumes sophisticated adversaries will exploit any gap |
| **The Moral Parliament Dissenter** | Attacks the ethical framework or value aggregation |
| **The Historical Parallelist** | Finds analogous historical situations where similar reasoning failed |
| **The Complexity Theorist** | Points to emergent behaviours and unmodeled interactions |
| **The Political Economist** | Focuses on power dynamics, rent-seeking, and who benefits |
| **The Cognitive Scientist** | Questions assumptions about human rationality and decision-making |
| **The Systems Engineer** | Asks about failure modes, redundancy, and graceful degradation |
| **The Evolutionary Skeptic** | Sees selection pressures that will undermine the proposal |
| **The Resource Economist** | Challenges assumptions about costs, scalability, and allocation |

### For each persona, generate ONE signature objection

The objection must:
- Target a specific claim or mechanism in the paper
- Explain the failure mode from that persona's worldview
- Be specific enough that it couldn't apply to 30%+ of papers with noun swaps

### Anti-slop constraints

- No generic hedging ("more nuance needed", "complex tradeoffs")
- No AI safety platitudes ("alignment is hard")
- No balance-softening ("while this paper contributes...")
- Every critique must specify: **target claim → failure mechanism → concrete consequence**
- Must pass the copy-paste test: could this critique apply to a different paper? If yes, make it more specific.

### Output format

Output EXACTLY 15 critiques as a numbered list. Each critique should be a self-contained paragraph that includes:
- The persona name in brackets
- The specific claim being attacked
- The failure mode from that worldview
- The concrete consequence if this objection holds

Format your output as:

1. [First critique - complete paragraph including persona]

2. [Second critique - complete paragraph including persona]

3. [Third critique - complete paragraph including persona]

...continue through...

15. [Fifteenth critique - complete paragraph including persona]

Each critique must be substantive (4-7 sentences) and paper-specific. Do not include any other text, headers, or commentary outside the numbered list.
