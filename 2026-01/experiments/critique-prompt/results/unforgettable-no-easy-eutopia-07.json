  "reasoning": "The critique attacks a peripheral example (digital welfare) rather than the core argument. The paper's main thesis is that eutopia is hard because value is multiplicative across many factors, and this doesn't depend on the specific digital being example. The critique's logical move\u2014that current uncertainty about AI welfare would collapse the survival baseline\u2014is questionable. The paper explicitly defines survival as avoiding 'near-zero value future' (existential catastrophe), not as a morally pristine baseline. The paper already acknowledges current moral catastrophes (factory farming, etc.) while maintaining survival has positive value. The critique conflates 'uncertainty about future digital welfare' with 'current systems having welfare'\u2014these are different claims. The paper discusses future beings that clearly have welfare; current AI welfare uncertainty is a separate issue the paper doesn't rely on. Even granting the critique's premise, it would at most require revising how the survival baseline is characterized, not collapse the entire framework comparing flourishing to survival. The critique is reasonably clear in its logic but makes factual errors about what the paper actually claims."
