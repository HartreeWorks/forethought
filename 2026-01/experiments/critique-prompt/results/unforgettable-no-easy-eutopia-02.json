  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's stipulation that extinction = 0 as an arbitrary anchor. However, this attack has limited centrality because: (1) The paper explicitly acknowledges that value functions are unique only up to positive affine transformation, and the choice is a stipulation for convenience, not a hidden assumption doing work; (2) The paper's core arguments about fussiness depend on the *ratios* between outcomes and the multiplicative structure of value across dimensions, not the absolute zero point; (3) Changing the zero point wouldn't change whether mostly-great futures are rare - it would just relabel the threshold. The critique is partially correct that anchoring choices can matter for some comparisons, but misunderstands that the paper's main conclusions (about fat-tailed distributions, multiplicative structure, bounded vs unbounded views) are largely invariant to such reanchoring. The critique also incorrectly implies this is doing 'unacknowledged' work when the paper explicitly discusses intertheoretic comparisons and normalization methods in Section 3.5. The strength is low because the paper's argument that eutopia is a narrow target doesn't actually depend on extinction being the zero - it depends on the structural claims about how value factors multiply and how resources must be allocated optimally."
