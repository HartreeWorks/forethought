  "reasoning": "The critique targets section 3.3's discussion of threats as a problem for moral trade scenarios. This is moderately central - threats are presented as one significant obstacle but not the only one (concentration of power, poor collective decision-making, etc. are also discussed). The paper already acknowledges uncertainty about whether threat-prevention would work ('it's not obvious to us that some kind of legal system which reliably prevents value-undermining threats would be mutually agreeable and stable'). The critique's argument that rational actors would invest in threat-prevention infrastructure is reasonable but doesn't fully engage with the paper's actual concern: that such prevention mechanisms might not be 'mutually agreeable and stable.' The MAD analogy is imperfect - nuclear powers had roughly symmetric destructive capabilities, whereas moral trade involves asymmetric values where one party might cheaply threaten what another deeply values. The critique correctly identifies that the paper describes what could be a disequilibrium, but doesn't adequately address why stable threat-prevention equilibria would necessarily emerge given heterogeneous values. The point is somewhat 'priced in' - the paper already discusses the limited literature on threats and acknowledges this is an open question. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue with minimal dead weight."
