  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's argument that under antirealism, different idealizing processes will diverge due to 'free parameters.' This is a meaningful but not fully central claim\u2014the paper offers multiple independent reasons for skepticism about WAM-convergence (section 2.4 covers both realism and antirealism cases, and sections 2.2, 2.5 provide additional arguments). The countermodel\u2014that coherence constraints might narrow stable reflective equilibria\u2014is an interesting theoretical possibility but remains highly speculative. The paper already acknowledges that idealization involves 'resolving inconsistencies' but argues this is 'underpowered' for convergence. The critique doesn't explain why coherence constraints would be so tight as to produce near-identity of views rather than merely ruling out some options, nor does it address the paper's point about the vast space of specific parameter choices (what experiences are best, precise functional forms, etc.). The analogy to mathematical convergence is weak since mathematical theorems have proof-based verification while ethical convergence lacks such mechanisms. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight, but its strength is limited because it offers a bare possibility rather than positive evidence or argument for why we should expect tight coherence constraints on value systems."
