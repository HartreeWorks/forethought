  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's dismissal of joint-aggregation bounded views via the 'scale-tipping' intuition pump, arguing this relies on poorly calibrated cosmic-scale intuitions. However, this is a relatively peripheral part of the paper's argument. The main thesis\u2014that eutopia is a narrow target\u2014rests on multiple independent arguments: (1) unbounded linear views requiring specific resource use, (2) separately-aggregating bounded views being fussy about bads, (3) practical linearity of most bounded views, and (4) the multiplicative model of value dimensions. The joint-aggregation discussion is explicitly presented as one narrow slice of views that might be easygoing, and the paper already acknowledges these views have 'major issues.' The critique's point about intuition reliability in cosmic contexts is reasonable and correct as far as it goes\u2014we indeed have poorly calibrated intuitions about cosmic scales. However, the paper's argument doesn't rely solely on this intuition; it also notes these views violate stochastic dominance and may favor extinction. The critique doesn't address these other problems. The strength is limited because even if we grant the critique's point about unreliable cosmic intuitions, this equally undermines our ability to confidently say such views ARE correct. It's a symmetric defeater. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight."
