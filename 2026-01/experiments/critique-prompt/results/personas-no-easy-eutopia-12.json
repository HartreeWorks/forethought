  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the idea that deliberative processes could lead society to converge on correct moral views - but this is discussed in the 'next essay' on convergence/compromise, not the core argument of THIS essay. The main thesis here is that eutopia is a narrow target (most moral views are 'fussy'), which the critique doesn't address. The paper explicitly defers the question of whether society can hit the target to future work. The critique makes some valid points about cognitive limitations and moral reasoning unreliability, but these are somewhat 'priced in' - the paper acknowledges psychological biases (hedonic treadmill) as reasons why eutopia seems easier than it is. The claim that deliberative convergence requires 'cognitive machinery that cannot reliably perform the required computations' has some merit but doesn't engage with the paper's actual systematic analysis of value functions. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on one general theme (cognitive limitations undermining moral convergence), but attacks a peripheral claim rather than the central argument about why eutopia is fragile and what moral views imply about the narrowness of the target."
