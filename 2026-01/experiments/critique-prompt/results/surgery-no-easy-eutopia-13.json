  "reasoning": "The critique targets the population ethics example from Section 2.3.1, arguing that this concern might be overstated if population ethics is genuinely indeterminate or if practical disagreements are narrower than theoretical ones. However, this is only one of many examples the paper uses to illustrate eutopian fragility - the paper also discusses digital beings, wellbeing theories, space governance, happiness/suffering tradeoffs, etc. The paper's core argument doesn't depend on population ethics specifically; it's that there are MANY such dimensions where error could occur, and the multiplicative model (Section 2.4) means failure on ANY one dimension loses most value. Even if population ethics concerns wash out, the paper's argument would remain largely intact. The critique has some merit - it's true the paper assumes there's a 'right answer' to population ethics that civilizations could miss - but it doesn't engage with the paper's explicit acknowledgment that disagreement exists across many dimensions simultaneously. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight, but its limited scope means low overall impact."
