  "reasoning": "The critique targets one specific claim in Section 3.3 about separately-aggregating bounded views being fussy due to tiny quantities of bads. This is one of several arguments for the 'no easy eutopia' thesis, so centrality is moderate (the paper also argues unbounded linear views are fussy, jointly-aggregating views have other problems, etc.). The strength is limited because: (1) the paper explicitly derives its calculation from assuming Common-sense utopia constitutes 50%+ of the upper bound - if one star system of goods reaches 50% of the bounded function, then symmetrically one star system of bads approaches 50% of disvalue bound; (2) the critique's countermodel with 10^10 star systems needed to reach 50% would imply Common-sense utopia (confined to our solar system) is nowhere near 50% of achievable value, contradicting the setup. The critique correctly identifies that the specific threshold depends on how quickly the bounded function approaches its limit, but doesn't fully engage with how this interacts with the paper's framing. The argument is clear and focused on a single issue with no dead weight."
