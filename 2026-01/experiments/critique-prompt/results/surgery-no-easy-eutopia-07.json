  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the separate-aggregation bounded view argument specifically, which is only one pathway in the paper's broader argument that most views are fussy. The paper's conclusion relies on multiple independent arguments (unbounded linear views, approximately-linear bounded views, separate aggregation bounded views, and joint aggregation bounded views), so undermining one pathway doesn't collapse the position. The critique correctly notes that the shape/parameterization of bounding functions matters, but the paper actually addresses this by noting that asymmetric functions (where disvalue isn't bounded or has a much higher bound) make the view even fussier, not more easygoing. A function with 'slow approach to the disvalue bound' as the critique suggests would still face the paper's argument that any non-trivial amount of bads accumulates toward that bound across cosmic scales. The critique identifies a real consideration but doesn't adequately engage with how the paper's argument works across the full range of parameterizations - it asserts sensitivity without demonstrating that plausible parameterizations yield easygoing conclusions. The critique is reasonably clear but somewhat technical without fully working through the implications. Single issue focus is high. Overall, it raises a relevant technical point but doesn't substantially undermine the paper's conclusion."
