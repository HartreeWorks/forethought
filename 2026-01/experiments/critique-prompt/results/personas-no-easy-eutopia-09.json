  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's use of historical moral catastrophes as evidence for eutopian fragility, arguing that these catastrophes were caused by confident moral optimization\u2014the very thing the paper recommends. However, this attacks a supporting example rather than the core argument. The paper's main thesis is that eutopia is a narrow target due to the multiplicative structure of value and the fussiness of plausible moral views\u2014arguments that don't depend on the historical examples. The paper explicitly acknowledges in later essays that deliberate optimization could be dangerous and discusses convergence/compromise mechanisms. The critique's historical observation is partially correct (many catastrophes did involve confident moral frameworks), but conflates the paper's call for 'optimization toward best outcomes' with the dogmatic certainty of historical ideologues\u2014the paper actually emphasizes moral uncertainty and the difficulty of identifying correct views. The critique is a single coherent argument, reasonably clear, with minimal dead weight. However, it doesn't engage with the paper's technical arguments about value functions, which form the actual core of the 'no easy eutopia' thesis."
