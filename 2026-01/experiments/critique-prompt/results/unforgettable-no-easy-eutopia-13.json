  "reasoning": "The critique targets Section 3.5 on moral uncertainty and intertheoretic comparisons, which is a relatively peripheral part of the paper's argument. The paper's main conclusion\u2014that eutopia is hard to achieve\u2014rests primarily on: (1) the multiplicative model of value across factors (Section 2), and (2) the analysis showing most individual moral views are fussy (Section 3.2-3.4). The intertheoretic section is more of an extension exploring what happens under uncertainty, not the core argument. The critique's logic is also weak: disagreement among normalization methods doesn't obviously favor 'easy eutopia'\u2014it could equally suggest we should be cautious and weight-average views (which the paper suggests leads to fussy conclusions anyway). The critique confuses 'experts disagree on aggregation' with 'we should suspend judgment on fussiness,' but the paper argues most individual views are fussy regardless of aggregation method. The claim that intertheoretic uncertainty 'undercuts confidence in its fussiness conclusion' is partially correct but overstated\u2014the paper acknowledges this is 'very thorny' and presents it as supplementary analysis. Correctness is moderate because the observation about normalization disagreement is true, but the inference drawn is questionable. Clarity is decent though the argument could be more precise about exactly how the inference works."
