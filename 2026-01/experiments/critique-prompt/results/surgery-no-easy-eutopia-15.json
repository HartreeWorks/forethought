  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the claim that bounded views are approximately linear due to cosmological scale assumptions. However, this is only one part of the paper's broader argument that most views are fussy. The paper argues multiple independent routes to fussiness: (1) unbounded linear views are fussy due to scale and fat-tailed value distributions, (2) bounded views are approximately linear AND therefore fussy, (3) difference-making bounded views with separate aggregation are fussy due to sensitivity to bads, (4) joint aggregation views have other problems. The critique only attacks point (2)'s empirical premise. Even if bounded views weren't approximately linear, the paper explicitly considers low-bounded difference-making views and finds them fussy through a different mechanism (extreme sensitivity to bads). The critique's correctness is moderate - it's true that cosmological uncertainty exists, but the paper's central claims don't fully depend on precise cosmological figures. The universe being 'smaller than assumed' would need to be dramatically so to matter, and the paper's qualitative point (human impact is tiny relative to universal scale) is robust. The critique is reasonably clear but not fully precise about what magnitude of cosmological error would actually undermine the argument."
