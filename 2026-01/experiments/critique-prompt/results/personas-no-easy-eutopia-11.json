  "reasoning": "The critique raises a single coherent issue: that the paper treats achieving eutopia as an epistemological/moral problem while ignoring political-economic dynamics and power conflicts. This is a valid observation but largely misses the paper's actual argument. The paper's core thesis is that *even if we could identify and agree on what's good*, the target of 'mostly-great futures' is narrow because value functions are fussy across most plausible moral views. The political economy critique would be relevant to the companion paper on 'convergence and compromise' (which the paper explicitly defers to), but the present paper is specifically about whether the target is big or small, not about whether we'll hit it. The paper explicitly acknowledges it 'doesn't imply that we're unlikely to reach eutopia' and saves the question of social coordination mechanisms for later. The critique's claims about AI ownership incentives and space resources are true observations but don't refute the core mathematical/philosophical arguments about value function structure. The critique conflates 'the paper doesn't discuss X' with 'X refutes the paper's argument.' Strength is low because even granting all the critique's points, the paper's central claims about multiplicative value, bounded vs unbounded views, and the narrowness of eutopia remain intact."
