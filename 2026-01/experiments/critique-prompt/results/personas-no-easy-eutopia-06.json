  "reasoning": "The critique attacks a second-order consequence of the paper's adoption (that it could justify extremism) rather than the paper's central claims about whether eutopia is hard to achieve. The paper explicitly acknowledges it doesn't imply we're unlikely to reach eutopia and defers questions about how society might navigate toward good outcomes to a subsequent essay. The critique conflates the descriptive claim (eutopia is a narrow target) with normative implications about what actors should do. The paper doesn't advocate for imposing particular visions\u2014it's analyzing the logical structure of value functions. The claim that 'essentially no bads' provides 'cover for totalitarian elimination' misreads the paper's analysis of what separately-aggregating bounded views imply, not what it recommends. The critique has some validity as a concern about misuse of philosophical frameworks, but this is tangential to whether the paper's arguments about eutopian fragility are correct. The reasoning is somewhat clear but relies on an unstated assumption that descriptive philosophical analysis creates mandates for action, which the paper doesn't claim."
