  "reasoning": "The critique attacks Section 3's argument that partial AM-convergence plus trade could yield a mostly-great future. This is moderately central - it's one of the main pathways the paper considers for reaching good futures, but the paper explicitly treats this as uncertain and discusses many caveats itself. The critique identifies a tension: if the target is narrow, why would altruistic reflectors cluster together? However, the strength is limited because: (1) the paper doesn't actually claim altruistic reflectors will tightly converge - it discusses this as a possibility with many qualifications; (2) the paper acknowledges in 3.2 that 'it's hard to know what fraction of resources the correct view will control'; (3) the critique misses that the paper's argument doesn't require tight clustering among altruists - it only needs some meaningful fraction controlling resources, combined with trade mechanisms. The paper explicitly considers scenarios where different linear views don't achieve much gain from trade. The correctness is moderate - the identified tension exists but is overstated, and the paper already addresses variants of this concern. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue with minimal dead weight."
