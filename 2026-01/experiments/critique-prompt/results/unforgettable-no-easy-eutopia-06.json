  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's argument that bounded views become approximately linear in practice because humanity's contribution to universal value is tiny. This is relevant to Section 3.3's argument against bounded views, but the paper actually addresses this by distinguishing between 'total universe' bounded views and 'difference-making' bounded views. The paper explicitly considers views bounded with respect to the difference humanity makes (the 'bubble' analogy), so the critique's suggestion that bounded theorists could define bounds over the accessible universe is already addressed. The critique has moderate correctness\u2014it's true that reference frames matter, but the paper already handles this. The argument that bounded theorists have 'no reason' to adopt universal reference frames ignores that many bounded views are naturally formulated this way. The centrality is moderate because even if this critique succeeded, the paper's arguments against difference-making bounded views (separate vs joint aggregation, scale-tipping, etc.) remain intact. Strength is low because the paper anticipates this move and argues against it. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue."
