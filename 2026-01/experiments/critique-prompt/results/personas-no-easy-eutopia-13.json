  "reasoning": "The critique focuses on a single issue: the lack of fault tolerance/error correction mechanisms in the multiplicative value model. However, this is not central to the paper's argument. The paper's core claim is descriptive\u2014that most plausible moral views are 'fussy' and eutopia is a narrow target\u2014not prescriptive about implementation architecture. The paper explicitly acknowledges this fragility as a feature of the moral landscape, not a design flaw to be fixed. The critique treats a normative/metaethical argument as if it were an engineering specification. The paper does actually address what happens when errors occur (the multiplicative model shows value drops significantly), and later essays discuss mechanisms for reaching good outcomes despite this difficulty. The critique's engineering framing is somewhat apt as an analogy but misses that the paper is characterizing the problem space, not proposing solutions. The claim about 'no mechanism for error correction' is partially correct but somewhat misses that the paper explicitly defers this to subsequent essays on 'convergence and compromise.' The critique is reasonably clear in what it argues, though it conflates descriptive and prescriptive claims."
