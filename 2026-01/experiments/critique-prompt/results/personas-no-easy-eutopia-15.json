  "reasoning": "The critique raises coordination costs and computational tractability issues for cosmic-scale optimization, which is relevant but not central to the paper's main argument. The paper's core thesis is that eutopia is difficult because value functions are 'fussy'\u2014requiring specific configurations across many dimensions\u2014not that we can or will successfully coordinate to achieve eutopia. The paper explicitly acknowledges the target is narrow and defers questions of whether society will hit that target to a subsequent essay. The critique conflates the paper's normative framework (what would constitute a mostly-great future) with practical implementation (whether we can achieve it). The 20 billion galaxies point is used to illustrate that linear views require vast scale, not to propose a governance system. The critique makes some correct points about coordination challenges, but these are largely compatible with the paper's conclusion that eutopia is hard\u2014indeed, coordination difficulties would reinforce this conclusion. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on one issue (coordination/computation costs), but it misses that the paper's framework is about evaluating futures, not prescribing how to achieve them."
