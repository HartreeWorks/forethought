  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's use of 'common-sense utopia' as a potentially satisfactory outcome. However, this concept is not central to the paper's main arguments. The paper's core thesis concerns whether WAM-convergence is likely and whether trade/compromise can achieve mostly-great futures - 'common-sense utopia' is mentioned as one example/scenario, not as the paper's primary escape route from pessimism. The paper explicitly states it's uncertain what the correct moral view is and discusses many different moral frameworks. The critique makes a fair point that 'common sense' has historically endorsed terrible things, which is partially correct and acknowledged by the paper itself (which discusses how apparent moral progress may be contingent). However, the paper doesn't argue that common-sense convergence alone guarantees a good future - it uses this as one illustration among many. The critique's strength is limited because: (1) the paper already addresses concerns about whether convergence leads to correct views, (2) the paper doesn't rely on common-sense utopia as its main argument for optimism, and (3) the paper discusses that superintelligent reflection might change what counts as common sense. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight."
