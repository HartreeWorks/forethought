  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the multiplicative model in Section 2.4, which is one illustration of why eutopia might be fragile. The paper's argument doesn't rest entirely on this toy model - it's presented as 'one model' to capture the idea, and the paper provides extensive independent arguments (Section 2.3's enumeration of moral catastrophes, Section 3's systematic analysis of bounded/unbounded views). So centrality is moderate - the independence assumption matters but isn't the sole foundation. The strength is limited because: (1) the paper explicitly notes it's a 'toy model' for illustration; (2) even with positive correlations, the multiplicative structure still makes eutopia harder than additive structures; (3) the paper's more technical Section 3 arguments about value functions don't depend on this specific model; (4) the critique would need to show correlations are so strong that getting one thing right essentially guarantees getting others right, which seems empirically dubious given historical moral catastrophes across different domains coexisting. The critique makes a valid conceptual point about correlation that the paper doesn't explicitly address, giving it moderate correctness. It's clear and focused on a single issue. Overall, it identifies a genuine gap in the toy model but overstates how much this undermines the paper's broader argument for eutopian fragility."
