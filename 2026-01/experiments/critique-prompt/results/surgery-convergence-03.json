  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's argument that moral convergence is unlikely given antirealism, which is one of several arguments against WAM-convergence in section 2.4. This is moderately central - the paper offers multiple independent reasons for pessimism about convergence, so refuting this one argument wouldn't collapse the position. The critique's 'causal reversal' argument has limited strength because: (1) the paper explicitly acknowledges superintelligent reflection in section 2.3.1 and argues it's insufficient for convergence, addressing the very conditions the critique invokes; (2) the paper's argument doesn't solely rely on historical disagreement - it offers structural arguments about 'free parameters' in ethics that would persist even under ideal conditions; (3) the analogy to physics convergence is imperfect since physics has external reality to constrain it, whereas under antirealism there's no objective moral truth to converge toward. The critique correctly identifies that the paper uses current disagreement as evidence, but understates how the paper addresses this by distinguishing empirical from fundamental moral disagreement. The critique is reasonably clear in its single-issue focus, though the 'reference class error' framing adds some unnecessary jargon. Low dead weight as most content contributes to the argument."
