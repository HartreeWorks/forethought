  "reasoning": "The critique argues the paper lacks specified mechanisms for how society would actually make and enforce decisions about reaching eutopia. However, this attacks something peripheral to the paper's actual argument. The paper explicitly states it addresses point (1) of their sailing analogy\u2014whether the 'island is easy to reach' (i.e., whether eutopia is a big target)\u2014and defers navigation/mechanism questions to the next essay on 'Convergence and Compromise.' The paper's core argument is that most moral views are 'fussy' about what constitutes eutopia, making it a narrow target regardless of mechanisms. The critique is correct that mechanisms aren't specified, but this is acknowledged and intentionally out of scope. The critique has some validity\u2014one could argue that achievability claims require mechanism analysis\u2014but the paper's thesis (eutopia presents a narrow target on most value functions) doesn't depend on specifying political/institutional design. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight, but fundamentally misidentifies what the paper is trying to establish."
