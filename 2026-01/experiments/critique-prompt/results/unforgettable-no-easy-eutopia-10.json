  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's claim that linear views require controlling 'most accessible resources' for a mostly-great future. However, this misunderstands the paper's argument. The paper explicitly addresses value-efficiency and fat-tailed distributions\u2014acknowledging that some resource uses are far more valuable than others. The paper's point is precisely that even WITH optimal value-density, linear views require scale because value is separable across space/time, so a galaxy of optimal arrangements is ~billion times more valuable than one star system of optimal arrangements. The Russell/Dostoevsky examples were about the distribution of value-per-resource (supporting fat-tailedness), not about escaping the scale requirement. The critique conflates 'value density' with 'total achievable value.' Even if you perfectly optimize a small region, on linear views that's still proportionally tiny compared to optimizing the accessible universe. The paper explicitly states 'Sheer scale is necessary for eutopia on linear views, but it's not sufficient'\u2014acknowledging the critique's point about optimization while maintaining the scale argument. The centrality is moderate because scale is one of several arguments for linear views being fussy, but the strength is low because the critique doesn't actually engage with the paper's reasoning about separability."
