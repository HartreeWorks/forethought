  "reasoning": "The critique attacks a specific point in Section 4.1 about whether self-interest alone could produce mostly-great futures. However, this is not central to the paper's main argument - Section 4 explicitly considers the case where 'no one aims at the good' as a subsidiary consideration, and the paper's core thesis about convergence and compromise doesn't depend on this section. The critique itself proposes an interesting counter-hypothesis (concave value function in 'alienness'), but provides no evidence or argument for why the value landscape would have this shape. The paper doesn't strongly commit to the alien-experience claim - it says 'plausibly' the best experiences are alien. The critique correctly identifies this as an empirical assumption, but the burden of proof works both ways, and the critique offers equally unsupported speculation. The 99%/1% numbers are pulled from nowhere. The claim is reasonably clear but somewhat imprecise about what 'quantitative cliff' means operationally. Single issue focus is maintained well. Overall, this challenges a peripheral point with speculation that isn't more compelling than the position's speculation."
