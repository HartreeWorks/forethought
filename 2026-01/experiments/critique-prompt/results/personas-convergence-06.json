  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the partial AM-convergence + trade scenario (Section 3), which is explicitly described as 'the most likely way in which we reach a mostly-great future.' This gives it moderate centrality - it targets an important mechanism but not the core thesis that Flourishing has greater scale than Surviving. The strength is low because: (1) the paper already acknowledges threats and value corruption as major concerns (Section 3.3-3.4), (2) the critique's specific mechanism - 'value-system parasites' outcompeting original values within a winning coalition - is speculative and underargued, (3) the paper discusses similar concerns about memetic power and 'epistemic black holes' (Section 2.5). The claim that 'memetic variants including subtle distortions could outcompete original values' is plausible but not demonstrated - it's unclear why successful moral coordination would create selection pressure for distorted variants specifically, rather than for the original values themselves. Correctness is moderate - the general concern about value drift is valid, but the specific mechanism proposed (selection within winning coalitions favoring distortions) lacks justification. The critique is reasonably clear in its single point, though 'value-system parasites' and how they'd work remains somewhat vague. Minimal dead weight."
