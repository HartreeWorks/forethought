  "reasoning": "The critique targets section 2.3.3's 'long views win' argument, which is explicitly described in the paper as only one of several subsidiary considerations within the broader discussion of post-AGI reflection (section 2.3). The paper already treats this as a weak argument for WAM-convergence, noting 'this isn't a reason for thinking that motivation to promote the good de dicto will become predominant.' The paper explicitly acknowledges that 'non-discounting values might not have time to win out' and that 'non-discounting views could be self-interested.' The critique's core claim\u2014that selection favors self-propagating rather than correct views\u2014is actually partially anticipated by the paper. However, the critique adds a valid point that patience could correlate with systematic moral errors, not just selfishness. The strength is moderate because while the critique identifies a genuine gap (selection for correctness vs. propagation), the paper already treats this mechanism skeptically and doesn't rely on it for its main conclusions. The paper's overall argument about partial AM-convergence and trade (section 3) doesn't depend on this mechanism. Correctness is reduced because the critique overstates the paper's endorsement of the 'long views win' dynamic\u2014the paper is explicitly tentative about it. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue."
