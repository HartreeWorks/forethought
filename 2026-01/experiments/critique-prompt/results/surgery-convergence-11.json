  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's argument that past moral progress doesn't reliably predict future convergence. This is a supporting argument in Section 2.2.2, not a central pillar - the paper's main argument against WAM-convergence rests more heavily on the meta-ethical analysis in 2.4 and the 'underpowered human preferences' argument. The critique makes a self-refutation argument: if our historical position biases our judgments about moral progress, the paper's skepticism is equally biased. However, this argument is relatively weak because: (1) the paper doesn't primarily rest on historical skepticism - it gives multiple alternative explanations for convergence (technological conditions, conformity pressures, contingent historical waves) which don't rely on the 'bias' point; (2) the paper explicitly acknowledges uncertainty and doesn't claim certainty about moral progress being illusory; (3) the 'cuts both ways' argument is somewhat valid but the paper's skepticism is more methodological than substantive - questioning whether we can infer future progress from past trends, not claiming we definitely can't. The critique has moderate correctness - the self-refutation point has some logical force, but overstates how much the paper relies on the specific 'bias' argument. Clarity is decent but could better specify which exact claims it's targeting."
