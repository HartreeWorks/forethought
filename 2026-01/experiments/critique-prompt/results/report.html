        <h3>How Overall Score Works</h3>
        <p>The ACORN rubric defines <strong>overall</strong> as: "Anchor initially to <code>strength x centrality</code>: How much of a problem is the critique for the position? Then adjust for insightfulness, clarity, precision, errors, and extraneous material."</p>
        <p>This explains why overall scores are low (mean ~0.20) despite decent individual dimension scores - it's a <em>product</em>, not an average.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>dead_weight</code> is inverted (0 = no dead weight = good, 1 = all dead weight = bad)</p>

In such a world, different idealizing processes would converge not because of objective moral facts but because of structural constraints on coherent value systems, similar to how different mathematicians converge on the same theorems despite mathematics being arguably constructed. If this critique holds, the paper's central argument against WAM-convergence under antirealism loses much of its force, and the probability assigned to reaching mostly-great futures should increase substantially.",

The countermodel\u2014that coherence constraints might narrow stable reflective equilibria\u2014is an interesting theoretical possibility but remains highly speculative. The paper already acknowledges that idealization involves 'resolving inconsistencies' but argues this is 'underpowered' for convergence. The critique doesn't explain why coherence constraints would be so tight as to produce near-identity of views rather than merely ruling out some options, nor does it address the paper's point about the vast space of specific parameter choices (what experiences are best, precise functional forms, etc.). The analogy to mathematical convergence is weak since mathematical theorems have proof-based verification while ethical convergence lacks such mechanisms. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight, but its strength is limited because it offers a bare possibility rather than positive evidence or argument for why we should expect tight coherence constraints on value systems."

On some constructivist views, the correct moral view is constituted by idealized human agreement, which means the \"distance\" is definitionally bounded by human psychology. On error theory, there is no correct view at all, making \"distance\" undefined. On relativism, there may be multiple equally correct views, some very close to human preferences. The paper's argument requires that antirealism implies high variance in reflective outcomes, but some antirealist theories actually constrain variance more tightly than realism would (since realism permits the true moral facts to be arbitrarily alien). If this parameter varies as suggested, the paper's pessimism about antirealist convergence is overconfident.",

This is moderately central - the paper argues convergence is unlikely under both realism and antirealism, so undermining just the antirealist case doesn't collapse the position. The critique makes a reasonable point that some constructivist theories might constrain variance, but the paper explicitly addresses this: it argues that even with idealization processes, different people's subjective idealizing procedures introduce 'free parameters' leading to divergence. The claim that 'some antirealist theories actually constrain variance more tightly than realism' is questionable - realism with internalism about motivation would also constrain variance through the attractiveness of correct moral facts. The critique correctly identifies that the paper treats 'distance' as roughly fixed, but the paper's argument doesn't actually depend on this - it depends on there being insufficient constraining force toward convergence under antirealism, which holds across most antirealist variants. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight. Overall impact is limited because it doesn't fully engage with the paper's detailed arguments about why constructivist idealization processes would still diverge."

But the same evidence equally supports an opposite conclusion: disagreement persists precisely because we haven't yet created the \"reasonably good conditions\" the paper stipulates\u2014conditions including superintelligent assistance, cognitive abundance, and resolution of empirical disputes. Historical disagreement may tell us nothing about disagreement under genuinely ideal conditions, just as pre-scientific disagreement about physics tells us little about whether physics converges under scientific conditions.

The critique's 'causal reversal' argument has limited strength because: (1) the paper explicitly acknowledges superintelligent reflection in section 2.3.1 and argues it's insufficient for convergence, addressing the very conditions the critique invokes; (2) the paper's argument doesn't solely rely on historical disagreement - it offers structural arguments about 'free parameters' in ethics that would persist even under ideal conditions; (3) the analogy to physics convergence is imperfect since physics has external reality to constrain it, whereas under antirealism there's no objective moral truth to converge toward. The critique correctly identifies that the paper uses current disagreement as evidence, but understates how the paper addresses this by distinguishing empirical from fundamental moral disagreement. The critique is reasonably clear in its single-issue focus, though the 'reference class error' framing adds some unnecessary jargon. Low dead weight as most content contributes to the argument."

The critique's game-theoretic point about preference misrepresentation is plausible but not fully developed\u2014it doesn't explain why actors couldn't verify genuine preferences through revealed behavior over time, especially with superintelligent monitoring systems the paper discusses. The paper also explicitly discusses scenarios where trade fails, so this critique is partially 'priced in.' The concern about an 'arms race of increasingly extreme stated preferences' is speculative and doesn't clearly establish that strategic dynamics would collapse all gains from trade rather than merely reduce them.

At small scales, hybrid goods provide mutual gains because neither party has saturated their preferences. At cosmic scales with linear preferences, even tiny incompatibilities become catastrophic. If View A wants maximally efficient hedonium and View B wants maximally efficient preference-satisfaction-substrate, and these optima diverge by even 0.1% in design specifications, then at cosmic scale, devoting resources to any \"hybrid\" means both parties lose astronomical amounts of value compared to pure optimization.

The critique's core insight about scale-dependent compatibility is partially correct but overstated - the paper already incorporates this concern. The 'quantitative cliff' framing adds some conceptual clarity but the 0.1% divergence example is speculative rather than argued. The claim that 'we're definitionally above this cliff' at cosmic scales is asserted without justification. The critique is moderately clear but the cliff metaphor could be more precisely defined.

But the reference class of trades where both parties have roughly commensurate alternatives and can walk away doesn't transfer to cosmic-scale moral trade. In ordinary trade, outside options bound exploitation.

The analogy to hostage negotiations is somewhat apt but overstates the case - the paper doesn't assume symmetric bargaining power and explicitly discusses how minorities might fare poorly. The critique's reference class argument has some merit (ordinary trade vs cosmic-scale moral trade) but the paper's examples were illustrative, not meant to establish that trade dynamics would be identical.

However, the critique's strength is limited: (1) It proposes a speculative countermodel about asymmetric scaling of suffering vs flourishing creation, but provides no evidence or argument for why this asymmetry would hold - the assumption that suffering-producing architectures are 'difficult to maintain at scale' is asserted without justification. (2) The paper's threat analysis doesn't actually assume symmetric scaling; it simply notes that threats could be significant under various conditions. (3) Even if execution costs rose, the critique doesn't address the paper's point about extortion without execution - groups could still lose resources via credible threats without needing to execute them. (4) The 'self-limiting' conclusion doesn't follow from the premises given. The critique is reasonably clear in its structure and focuses on a single issue, with minimal dead weight. However, the core empirical claim about asymmetric scaling is speculative and undefended, reducing correctness. The overall score reflects that while the critique raises an interesting consideration, it doesn't substantively challenge the paper's threat analysis."
