  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the assumption that coordinated efforts could steer civilization toward eutopia, arguing game-theoretic defection is the dominant equilibrium. However, the paper's main thesis is that eutopia is a narrow target (most moral views are 'fussy'), NOT that we can definitely achieve it through coordination. The paper explicitly states the next essay addresses whether 'forces guide society towards hitting' the target. The critique conflates 'eutopia is hard to define/achieve' with 'we assume coordination will work.' The paper actually acknowledges resource concentration as a failure mode, so the critique's point is somewhat priced in. The critique correctly identifies real coordination problems and first-mover dynamics, which is why correctness is moderate. But it misses that the paper's core argument is about the TARGET being narrow (Section 3's detailed analysis of moral views), not about whether we'll hit it. The paper is arguing for 'no easy eutopia' - that even abundant, free societies might miss eutopia - not claiming coordination will succeed. Strength is limited because the coordination question is explicitly deferred to the next essay."
