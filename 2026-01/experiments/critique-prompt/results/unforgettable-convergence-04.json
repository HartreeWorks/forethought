  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's methodological structure of first assuming 'reasonably good conditions' and then analyzing convergence under those conditions. This is a meaningful structural critique but not fully central - the paper explicitly acknowledges blockers (section 2.5) and discusses them separately. The paper's analysis doesn't require that we reach reasonably good conditions with certainty; it's exploring conditional probabilities. The critique's strength is limited because: (1) the authors explicitly state they're analyzing 'whether WAM-convergence is likely given reasonably good conditions' as a separate question from reaching those conditions, (2) coordinating on institutional arrangements may be easier than coordinating on fundamental moral views since institutions can be instrumental goods with wider agreement, and (3) the paper already acknowledges this concern in its blockers discussion. The critique makes a coherent point but overstates the problem - analyzing conditionals isn't question-begging. The claim that 'if people won't converge on correct moral views, they certainly won't converge on institutional arrangements' is asserted without justification and may be false since institutional design involves different types of reasoning than moral philosophy. Clarity is reasonable though the argument is compressed. Single issue focus is maintained throughout."
