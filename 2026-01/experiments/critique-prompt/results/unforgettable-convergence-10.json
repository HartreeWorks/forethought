  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's method of conditioning on different metaethical views to draw conclusions about WAM-convergence. This is moderately central since Section 2.4 does use this disjunctive reasoning structure (if realism then X, if antirealism then Y). However, it's not fully central because: (1) the paper draws pessimistic conclusions from BOTH horns independently, so miscalibrated confidence in antirealism wouldn't change the conclusion if realism also yields pessimism; (2) the paper has multiple independent arguments for pessimism beyond Section 2.4. The critique's strength is limited because it doesn't engage with the actual arguments under each horn - it merely claims the inference pattern 'only works if our uncertainty is well-calibrated' without showing why the paper's conclusions would differ under different credence distributions. The claim that 'superintelligent reflection could resolve metaethical questions' is speculative and the paper explicitly discusses superintelligent reflection in 2.3.1 without assuming it resolves metaethics. Correctness is moderate - the methodological concern about conditioning on metaethical views is legitimate in principle, but the claim that 'antirealism is culturally dominant in academic philosophy' is arguably false (surveys show more realists than antirealists among metaethicists). The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single methodological issue."
