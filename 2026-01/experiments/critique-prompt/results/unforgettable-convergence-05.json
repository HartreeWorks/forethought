  "reasoning": "The critique targets section 2.4's realism/antirealism dilemma, which is a meaningful but not fully central argument in the paper. The paper's broader argument about convergence draws from multiple sources (sections 2.2, 2.3, 3, 4), so even if 2.4 were undermined, substantial pessimism about WAM-convergence would remain. The critique raises a valid point that constructivism might offer a middle path, but the paper does briefly address this by noting that 'the idea that there's some objectively correct idealising process seems inconsistent with the basic motivation for subjectivism.' The critique claims constructivism 'isn't antirealism' but this is contested in metaethics - many classify constructivism as a form of antirealism. More importantly, even granting constructivism, the critique doesn't explain why convergence would actually occur under constructivism - it merely asserts that convergence is 'possible' without addressing the paper's specific arguments about free parameters, different idealizing processes, and starting point divergence. The critique is reasonably clear but underdeveloped, making one specific point without elaborating how constructivism actually solves the convergence problems the paper identifies."
