  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the concept of 'hybrid goods' in Section 3.1-3.2, which is one mechanism through which trade/compromise could lead to mostly-great futures. However, this is only one part of the trade argument - the paper also discusses resource-compatibility through other means (different valuations of resources, locations, time preferences, risk attitudes). The paper explicitly acknowledges that 'resource-compatibility between linear views seems unlikely' (Section 3.4), so the critique's point is partially already 'priced in.' The critique makes a reasonable logical point - that hybrid goods may involve substantial efficiency discounts incompatible with the 'narrow target' premise - which has moderate strength. However, the paper doesn't claim hybrid goods are *always* efficient; it offers them as one possibility among several. The critique is largely correct in its logic (high cognitive requirements for bliss might conflict with wisdom-optimizing architectures), though it overstates certainty about incompatibility. Clear and focused on a single issue. Low dead weight - the example about hedonists/objective-list theorists is relevant. Overall, a moderately useful critique that highlights a tension in the argument but attacks a non-central mechanism and overlooks that the paper already acknowledges similar limitations."
