  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's claim that joint-aggregation bounded views are implausible due to 'scale-tipping' problems (Section 3.3). While the scale-tipping argument is one reason given against this class of views, it's not the primary argument\u2014the paper also notes these views violate stochastic dominance, may favor extinction, and represent only a 'narrow slice' of plausible views. The critique's 'equilibrium shift' argument\u2014that rational actors would avoid threshold-adjacent scenarios\u2014doesn't actually refute the scale-tipping problem as a theoretical implausibility; it merely suggests practical workarounds. The paper is making a conceptual point about what the view implies, not a prediction about real-world scenarios. A moral view that requires strategic avoidance of certain comparisons to avoid counterintuitive implications still has those counterintuitive implications. The critique conflates practical decision procedures with fundamental value theory. The argument is moderately clear but contains some ambiguity about what 'equilibrium shift' means in this context. It focuses on a single issue but that issue is peripheral to the main thesis that most plausible views are fussy."
