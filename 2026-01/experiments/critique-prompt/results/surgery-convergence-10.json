  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's argument (section 2.2.2) that past moral progress doesn't reliably predict future convergence. However, this is only one of several arguments against WAM-convergence - the paper's main argument (section 2.4) is the meta-ethical argument about realism/antirealism making convergence unlikely, which is untouched. The critique's central claim - that path-contingency doesn't imply outcome-contingency - is a valid logical point and somewhat insightful. However, the paper already anticipates this by noting that even if there's 'some underlying driver' of progress, it might not be 'enough to deliver all the moral progress we have left to make.' The water-finding-its-way-downhill analogy actually requires assuming strong moral realism with powerful attractive forces toward correct views, which is precisely what the paper questions elsewhere. The critique doesn't actually provide evidence that moral arguments are strong enough to overcome contingent forces - it just asserts this is possible. While the point about distinguishing path vs. outcome contingency is correct and clear, it doesn't substantially undermine the paper's overall skepticism about convergence, which rests on multiple independent grounds."
