  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's claim that moral views are unlikely to become more easygoing after reflection. This is a relatively minor supporting claim in Section 3, not central to the main argument. The main argument is that most plausible moral views ARE fussy (through detailed analysis of bounded/unbounded views), not primarily that reflection won't change this. The 'causal reversal' argument is weak: the paper doesn't merely argue 'we can't specify easygoing views therefore they don't exist' - it provides systematic analysis showing why specific attempts at easygoing views fail (joint aggregation problems, stochastic dominance violations, etc.). The historical analogy to metaethical innovations is too generic - it could justify hope for any position we currently can't articulate. The critique is correct that inability to currently articulate something is weak evidence of impossibility, but this doesn't engage with the paper's actual arguments about WHY easygoing views fail. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight."
