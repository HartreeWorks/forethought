  "reasoning": "The critique attacks section 2.5's use of hedonic treadmill effects as psychological evidence for why eutopia seems easier than it is. This is a minor supporting argument in the paper - the main argument relies on (1) historical moral catastrophes, (2) the multiplicative model of value factors, and (3) the technical analysis of moral views in Section 3. The treadmill argument is presented as one explanation among several for why eutopia 'might be harder than it seems,' not as foundational. The critique has some merit - there is a tension in using psychological biases selectively - but the paper's core case doesn't depend on this. The paper could simply remove section 2.5 and retain its argument that value is multiplicative across factors (section 2.4) and that most moral views are fussy (section 3). The critique is correct that there's a potential inconsistency, but the paper isn't primarily arguing 'our intuitions say eutopia is close, but psychology shows our intuitions are wrong' - rather, it argues substantively through examples and formal analysis that eutopia is genuinely difficult. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue, but attacks a peripheral supporting argument rather than the central claims."
