  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's use of current billionaire philanthropy rates as evidence that self-interest won't shift toward altruism with abundance. This is a supporting point in section 2.3.2, not central to the main argument. The paper's core argument is that self-interest alone is insufficient because (1) many goods are not instrumentally valuable for self-interest, (2) the best experiences may be alien to current people, and (3) people may fail to converge on correct views of their own good. The billionaire philanthropy point is one piece of evidence among several. The critique makes a reasonable point that status equilibria could shift, but: (a) the paper acknowledges abundance could shift motivations but argues this wouldn't ensure convergence to correct values, (b) the critique's equilibrium argument is speculative and doesn't address the deeper structural issues the paper raises about divergence between self-interest and overall good, (c) even if status competition shifted toward moral exemplarity, this doesn't guarantee convergence on the *correct* moral views. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue but doesn't substantially weaken the paper's overall argument about self-interest being insufficient for mostly-great futures."
