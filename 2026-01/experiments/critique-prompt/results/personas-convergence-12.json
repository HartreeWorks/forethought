  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the assumption that preferences are stable objects that can be 'idealized' through reflection, drawing on cognitive science research on preference construction. However, the position itself already addresses this concern to some degree - Section 2.3.1 explicitly discusses how people might 'just not be moved by those arguments' from their reflective selves, and the paper acknowledges significant uncertainty about whether reflection would lead to convergence. The position doesn't strongly depend on preferences being perfectly stable - it's exploring whether convergence is likely, and ultimately concludes it probably isn't (at least not WAM-convergence). The critique's point about preference construction is a legitimate concern from cognitive science, but it's somewhat 'priced in' to the position's skepticism about convergence. The position already considers that different idealizing processes might lead to different places (Section 2.4.2). The correctness is moderate - while preference construction research is real, the critique somewhat overstates its implications, as the position can accommodate constructed preferences while still asking whether reflection processes tend to converge. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight."
