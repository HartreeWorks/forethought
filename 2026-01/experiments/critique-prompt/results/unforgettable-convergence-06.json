  "reasoning": "The critique attacks section 2.3.3 ('long views win'), which is one of several considerations in section 2.3 about post-AGI reflection. However, the authors explicitly state this consideration provides only limited force for optimism, and the main argument against WAM-convergence comes in section 2.4. The essay's core structure doesn't depend on 'long views win' - it's presented as one possible mechanism that might favor altruistic values, but the authors already acknowledge its limitations. The critique makes a reasonable point that patience could benefit any non-discounting goal, not just altruistic ones - but the position already partially addresses this: 'even if non-discounting values win out over time, those non-discounting values could be for many different things: they could be self-interested in a way that doesn't discount one's interests in time, or they could be based on a misguided ideology.' The critique's claim that memetic fitness may oppose moral accuracy is somewhat correct but not as devastating as presented, since the position doesn't claim asymmetric growth alone guarantees convergence to correct views. The critique is clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight. However, given the limited centrality of this consideration to the overall argument (which concludes pessimistically about WAM-convergence anyway), and the partial anticipation of this objection in the text, the overall impact is modest."
