  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's reliance on 'trade and compromise' mechanisms (Section 3) as underspecified. This is moderately central - the paper presents trade/compromise as 'the most likely way in which we reach a mostly-great future' but it's one of several paths considered (alongside WAM-convergence and partial convergence). The critique has limited strength because: (1) the paper explicitly acknowledges uncertainty about trade mechanisms and discusses blockers to trade in 3.5; (2) the paper's argument doesn't require fully specified protocols - it's exploring whether trade COULD enable good futures, not designing actual mechanisms; (3) the paper does engage with enforcement issues (mentioning superintelligence-enabled contracts, transaction costs, mutual trust). The critique is partially correct that formal specifications are absent, but overstates the requirement for 'computational proofs' of efficiency in a philosophical exploration paper. The claim that contract verification across 'radically different ontologies' is unaddressed has merit, though the paper does discuss value compatibility issues. The critique is reasonably clear but somewhat overwrought in demanding formal protocol specification from a conceptual piece. Single issue focus on mechanism underspecification. Overall score reflects that while the critique identifies a genuine gap, it doesn't substantially undermine the paper's exploratory analysis of whether trade could plausibly help achieve good futures."
