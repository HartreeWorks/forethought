  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the multiplicative model of value, which is indeed important to the paper's argument (Section 2.4 explicitly presents this as a key model). However, the paper doesn't fully depend on strict multiplicativity\u2014it uses this as an illustrative model alongside other arguments (Section 2.3's examples of future catastrophes, Section 3's analysis of bounded/unbounded views). The critique's strength is moderate: it correctly notes the analogies to wealth/wellbeing may not transfer, but doesn't engage with the paper's more systematic arguments in Section 3 about why most plausible moral views are fussy regardless of the multiplicative framing. The paper explicitly acknowledges multiplicativity is a 'toy model' and provides independent arguments. The critique's claim that wellbeing factors are 'often substitutive' is partially true but oversimplified\u2014chronic pain genuinely reduces achievable wellbeing ceilings in most studies. The critique is clear and focused on one issue with no dead weight. Overall, it raises a legitimate concern about one supporting argument but doesn't substantially undermine the paper's broader case, which rests on multiple independent lines of reasoning including the detailed analysis of different value functions."
