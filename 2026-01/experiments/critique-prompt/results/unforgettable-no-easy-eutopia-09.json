  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's approach to moral uncertainty (Section 3.5), arguing that satisficing across views rather than expected value maximization could make eutopia easier to achieve. This is moderately central - the paper does discuss moral uncertainty, but the main arguments for 'no easy eutopia' in Sections 2-3.4 (multiplicative value, linear/bounded views analysis) are largely independent of how one handles intertheoretic comparisons. The paper's core claim that most individual views are fussy would remain even if the uncertainty aggregation changed. Strength is limited because: (1) the paper acknowledges uncertainty about intertheoretic comparisons and doesn't claim to resolve it; (2) satisficing approaches face their own problems the critique doesn't address (how to set thresholds? what if views fundamentally conflict?); (3) the claim that satisficing 'inherits joint aggregation's easygoingness without scale-tipping problems' is asserted without argument. The critique is somewhat correct - satisficing is a legitimate alternative to expected value maximization under uncertainty - but overstates how much this would help, since the paper's fussiness results come from analyzing individual views, not just aggregation. Clarity is moderate - the core idea is discernible but 'satisficing across views' and how it avoids problems is underspecified. Single issue: focuses entirely on the moral uncertainty methodology question."
