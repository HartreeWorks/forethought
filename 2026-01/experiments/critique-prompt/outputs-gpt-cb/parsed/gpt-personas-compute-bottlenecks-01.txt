[The Empirical Hardliner] **Target claim:** “pretty much all economic estimates of ρ have implausible implications about the max speed… so most likely −0.2<ρ<0.” **Failure mechanism (measurement/identification failure):** your “max speed is implausibly low” step is doing the inferential heavy lifting, but it’s not an identified estimate—it’s an intuition aggregator over items like “optimising every part of the stack,” “running smaller experiments,” and “stopping experiments early,” none of which you quantify or tie to observed counterfactuals under fixed compute. Worse, you reject manufacturing-based ρ as ‘not analogous,’ then replace it with a new “analogy class” (AI researcher chats + toy examples) that has no falsifiable mapping from interventions to output-speed. **Consequence:** the posterior range “−0.2<ρ<0” is basically unconstrained; your final 10–40% SIE probability is not a forecast but a vibe, and a critic can dismiss every downstream conclusion as untethered to observable causal structure.
