[The Capability Accelerationist] Target claim: “By default society wouldn’t have time to prepare… compute bottlenecks probably don’t slow an SIE until late stages.” Failure mechanism: you’re handing competitors a justification to sprint: if compute isn’t the limiter early, the race is about who automates R&D first—so everyone will prioritize capability automation over safety or interpretability because the payoff is dominating the feedback loop. Agent A (a nation-state lab) operationalizes your “early stage isn’t compute-bottlenecked” view, causing System B (global coordination) to collapse as others mirror the move to avoid being left behind. Consequence: even if your technical model were right, publishing this framing predictably increases the probability of the very fast takeoff you claim is dangerous, by shifting incentives toward reckless automation.
