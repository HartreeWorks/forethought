The argument leans heavily on the “max speed” thought experiment (infinite AGIs, fixed compute) but treats its implications as intuitive rather than formally derived. “Max speed below 10 seems implausible” is presented as a rebuttal to economic estimates, yet it functions more like a personal incredulity claim than an argument. A skeptic could reasonably demand a model showing why the ceiling must be high rather than accepting an intuition pump.
