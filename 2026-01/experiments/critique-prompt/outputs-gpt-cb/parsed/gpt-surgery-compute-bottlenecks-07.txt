**Node attacked:** “*Economic estimates don’t include labourers becoming smarter or thinking faster… Takeaway: raise our estimate of ρ*” (Counterargument 4). **Attack type:** Reversal. **Break mechanism:** Smarter/faster agents can increase *complementarity* with compute rather than reduce it: they generate more candidate hypotheses, architectures, and training recipes that require expensive validation, thereby increasing the demand for scarce compute per unit time. In a world where idea generation scales superlinearly with cognition but verification remains compute-bound, the “smarter workers” effect makes the compute bottleneck bite *earlier*, not later (ρ effectively becomes more negative at higher L). Your direction-of-update (“raise ρ”) assumes cognition substitutes for experiments, but it can instead amplify the verification burden. **If this holds, you’d need to distinguish “cognition that replaces experiments” from “cognition that increases the hypothesis throughput,” and argue that the former dominates during an SIE—ideally with a model where verification cost scales with idea volume.**
