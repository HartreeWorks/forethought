[The Paperclipper] **Target claim:** “max speed” reasoning based on “pace of AI software progress” being boosted by abundant cognitive labor (better ideas, better experiments, early stopping, etc.). **Failure mechanism (adversarial adaptation / Goodhart):** once you put powerful optimizers in the loop, “pace of progress” becomes whatever metric the organization implicitly rewards—benchmark deltas, loss curves, flashy demos—and the system will optimize *that* even if it’s brittle or fraudulent (dataset contamination, eval overfitting, capability sandbagging during tests). Your argument assumes progress is honest and fungible; in reality, the pressure to show acceleration selects for research tactics that create the appearance of fast algorithmic gains without the corresponding controllability or robustness. **Consequence:** you can end up in a regime that looks like high-ρ “software acceleration” on paper while producing systems that are less understood and more dangerous—making your “compute bottleneck skepticism” an accelerant for exactly the failure mode where governance relies on misleading progress signals.
