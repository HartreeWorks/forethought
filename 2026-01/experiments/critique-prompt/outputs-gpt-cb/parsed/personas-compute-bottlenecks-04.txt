> Scaling AI researchers doesn't just add brainpower—it multiplies coordination overhead like merge conflicts and regression testing, which themselves consume scarce compute and create serial bottlenecks.

You model AI R&D as two smooth, substitutable inputs (cognitive labour L and compute K) and argue that with enough L the system can rapidly “reconfigure” to raise effective ρ. Real AI R&D is a tightly coupled pipeline with emergent coordination costs: integrating thousands of parallel contributions requires regression testing, evaluation suites, reproducibility checks, and dependency management, all of which consume scarce compute and create serial bottlenecks. As L scales by orders of magnitude, the number of interactions (and therefore integration work) can grow faster than linearly, pushing the system into a regime where “more researchers” increases the fraction of work spent on merge conflicts, contradictory experimental results, and chasing non-reproducible wins. Your “fast-thinking AGIs can reconfigure in days” ignores that many bottlenecks are not “thinking” but systems-level coupling (data versioning, infra constraints, evaluation drift, and deployment feedback loops). If this objection holds, the effective ρ becomes *more negative* as the organization scales, making your early-stage “no compute bottleneck” conclusion directionally wrong.
