**"The Serial Experiment Chain"** — The paper argues that **massive parallel cognitive labor** implies **rapid reconfiguration and faster algorithmic iteration**, because **AGIs can think faster and run many experiments / idea-generation in parallel**. But the critical path in empirical ML is often *serial*: you need results from today’s best run to decide tomorrow’s ablations, interpret failures, update data filters, and choose the next architecture; parallelism helps only off the critical path. As L scales, you can generate more candidate ideas, but you cannot validate them without stepping through a sequential chain of high-signal experiments whose wall-clock is bounded by training time, evaluation time, and debugging cycles—each of which consumes compute and calendar time. This makes the effective elasticity look complementary even when lots of “labor” exists, because the marginal labor mostly piles up behind a serial validation bottleneck. If this holds, the paper would need to argue that frontier-validation can itself be parallelized (or replaced by reliable prediction) enough to break the serial critical path, not just that “more researchers” exists.
