The paper treats compute as a quasi-fixed input in the relevant window and frames the question as substitutability between cognitive labour and compute inside R&D. In reality, the moment credible “software-only acceleration” appears, the distribution of power and capital changes: investors and states pour money into compute, firms vertically integrate chips, and geopolitics gates access to leading-edge fabs. That makes K endogenous to expected rents, and it also concentrates K in a few actors who can impose their own bottlenecks (export controls, exclusive supply contracts, internal allocation fights) irrespective of any technical ρ. Your model therefore misses the dominant mechanism by which “bottlenecks” actually appear: not physics, but control of supply chains and legal coercion. If this objection holds, your focus on whether compute bottlenecks are technically weak mispredicts the *actual* limiter on an SIE—political allocation of compute—and your timelines and probabilities are anchored to the wrong variable.
