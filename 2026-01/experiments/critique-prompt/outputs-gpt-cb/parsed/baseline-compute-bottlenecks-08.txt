The discussion of “smarter/faster researchers” risks double-counting and equivocation about what counts as cognitive labor versus compute. Faster “thinking” by AIs is typically realized by running more inference steps or more parallel copies, which consumes additional compute and memory bandwidth. If “more labor” implicitly requires “more compute,” then the paper overstates substitutability and may be inflating ρ by definitional fiat.
