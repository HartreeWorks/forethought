> Calling mental simulation "labour" instead of "compute" just smuggles compute back under a different name—once you account for the physical operations required, the supposed proof that cognitive labour fully substitutes for compute collapses.

**"The ‘AGIs Simulate Compute in Their Heads’ Mirage"** — The paper argues that **ρ<0 is “flawed in the absolute limit”** because **cognitive labor can in principle fully substitute for compute by mentally simulating experiments** (the Ryan Greenblatt toy example). But this conflates “cognitive labor” with “physical computation”: simulating SGD, attention, and massive matrix multiplies is itself computation that must be instantiated somewhere, and if it’s instantiated in the AGIs’ substrate, that substrate is literally compute K by another name. Treating it as L smuggles compute back in while claiming substitution, which makes the argument self-undermining: it refutes complementarity only by redefining compute as labor. Once you enforce a conservation constraint (“all cognition consumes the same scarce physical operations/energy/memory bandwidth”), the supposed proof that ρ can approach 0 evaporates. If this holds, the paper would need to drop “mental simulation” as evidence about ρ and instead argue for concrete channels where *the same fixed hardware* yields more validated progress per wall-clock.
