> The "just simulate it in your head" move is circular—those heads still run on physical compute, so you haven't escaped the fixed FLOP budget, you've just shuffled it around.

**"The ‘do the compute in your head’ substitution argument violates physical accounting"**  
The paper notes that, in principle, sufficiently capable cognitive labor could simulate experiments “in their heads,” implying compute and cognition are ultimately substitutable. But unless those “heads” are themselves running on physical compute, the claim is a category error: simulation requires operations, memory bandwidth, and energy somewhere. If the AGIs are implemented on the same hardware whose compute is “fixed,” then “thinking harder” cannot exceed the physical FLOP budget; it merely reallocates it. If the argument instead imagines non-digital minds or radically different substrates, then the scenario has quietly changed the hardware premise. So this point weakens the bottleneck objection only by relaxing the constraint (“fixed compute”) in a way that critics needn’t grant.
