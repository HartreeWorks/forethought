> The paper's key parameter ρ is backed by vibes rather than any testable mechanism, so the resulting probability estimate can't actually be updated when new evidence arrives.

The paper’s central move—“most likely −0.2 < ρ < 0, so compute bottlenecks won’t bite early”—is asserted via informal plausibility (“seems implausible,” “talking to researchers”) rather than a measurable mechanism that ties algorithmic progress to an experimentally testable scaling law. You never specify what observable quantity in current ML maps to “pace of AI software progress” in the CES analogy, so there’s no falsifiable prediction that could distinguish your “ρ near 0” world from Epoch’s “ρ < −0.2” world. The “max speed” argument is especially non-empirical: it converts a parameter into an intuition pump (“trillions of God-like AIs would surely get >10×”), then uses that intuition to reject the parameter range. Without a causal model of where algorithmic improvements come from (e.g., distribution of idea quality, experiment cost curves, validation overhead) you’re just handwaving at the sign and magnitude of ρ. If this objection holds, your 10–40% SIE probability is not an estimate but a vibe, and the reader can’t update on it with new evidence.
