**"Labor-from-Compute Circularity"** — The paper argues that **more AI cognitive labor (L)** implies **faster AI software progress (Y)**, because **cognitive labor can be increased while holding compute (K) fixed** (the CES thought experiment of “drop in unlimited AGI researchers”). But in AI R&D, “labor” is not an independent input: those AGI researchers are themselves *running on the same compute pool* as the experiments they propose, debug, and evaluate. Once you model L as a function of K (and of memory bandwidth, interconnect, and inference latency), the counterfactual “L→∞ at fixed K” becomes physically incoherent, and the paper’s max-speed intuition (“<10× seems implausible”) loses its anchor. This breaks a central move: the paper’s argument that low ρ has “implausibly low implications” relies on a scenario that cannot exist in the target domain. If this objection holds, the analysis would need a production function where “researcher-labor” is a *compute allocation decision* (inference+tooling+coordination overhead) competing directly with experimental compute, not a separable factor.
