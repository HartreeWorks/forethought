**"CES is a production function; you’re modeling a search process as if it were a factory."** The core move maps \(Y\) (output) to “pace of AI software progress,” and then imports the CES notion of a ceiling on \(Y\) when inputs are complementary. But R&D progress isn’t produced by contemporaneous factor mixing; it is a stochastic search over hypotheses with feedback loops, path dependence, and winner-take-all discoveries where marginal returns are governed by exploration dynamics, not static substitution elasticities. In a search process, you can have long flat periods followed by discontinuous jumps from one conceptual breakthrough, meaning there may be no well-defined “max speed” that depends smoothly on \(L\) and \(K\) the way CES assumes. This isn’t “CES is imperfect”; it’s that the object \(Y(L,K)\) the paper needs may not exist as a stable function at all. If the author defends by saying “it’s a rough prior,” then the later quantitative claims (e.g., max speeds of 6× vs 30× vs 100×) are revealed as numerology: the model’s outputs have no bearing on the phenomenon being argued about.
