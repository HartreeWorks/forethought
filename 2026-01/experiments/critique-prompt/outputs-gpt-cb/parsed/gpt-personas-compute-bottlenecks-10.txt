[The Mechanistic Alignment Skeptic] **Target claim:** using CES with Y as a single “pace of AI software progress,” then later arguing a “strongest link” view with multiple routes where “you just need one of them to work.” **Failure mechanism (normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction):** those are incompatible aggregations: CES is a smooth, single-output production function that bakes in how marginal substitutions behave, while your “multiple routes” argument is effectively a max-over-pathways model where the tail dominates. You can’t appeal to CES ceilings and “max speed” intuition *and* to “we’ll just switch to whichever method has favorable ρ” without rewriting the model, because the implied dynamics (diminishing returns vs option-switching discontinuities) are different. **Consequence:** the paper’s central quantitative takeaway—“compute bottlenecks probably don’t bite until late stages for −0.2<ρ<0”—is not robust to how AI R&D actually composes across paradigms, so a skeptical reader can legitimately conclude your entire ‘late bottleneck’ result is an artifact of inconsistent modeling choices rather than a property of the world.
