"Conflating ‘More Researchers’ with ‘More Effective Cognitive Labor’" — The paper treats L as “the amount of AI cognitive labour applied to R&D,” sliding between (i) more parallel copies, (ii) smarter researchers, and (iii) faster thinking as if they are commensurable and enter the same substitution relationship with compute. Yet these are different interventions with different bottlenecks: parallelism hits coordination costs and experiment throughput; speed hits serial dependencies; “smarts” may reduce sample complexity but may also require more compute for larger models. Economic estimates of substitution are indeed about “more workers,” but that doesn’t license replacing them with an undifferentiated “cognitive labor” variable that includes qualitative intelligence gains. The argument that “economic estimates don’t include smarter workers, so raise ρ” is not a valid inference unless you show that increased intelligence systematically increases substitutability with compute rather than increasing compute demand (e.g., to run more ambitious experiments). The paper’s conclusion relies on this conflation to make compute look less binding than it might be under a more realistic decomposition.
