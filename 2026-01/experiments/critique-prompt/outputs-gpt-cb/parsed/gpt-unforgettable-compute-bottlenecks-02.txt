"The Static Production Fallacy" — You attack the compute-bottleneck objection by translating CES into a “max speed of AI software progress,” treating \(Y\) like an instantaneous rate with a hard ceiling at fixed \(K\). That inference silently swaps a static production function (output level from inputs at a moment) for a dynamic R&D process where the relevant state variable is accumulated knowledge and the control variable is *how you spend compute over time*. Mechanism: with fixed compute, you can front-load expensive exploration or amortize it, so the same “inputs” can yield very different *time paths* of progress; a static ceiling on \(Y(L,K)\) doesn’t imply a ceiling on cumulative algorithmic improvements over months. If this objection holds, the “30× max speed” graphs are not evidence about SIE timing; you need a dynamic model (e.g., a search/optimization process with compute as sampling budget) that derives acceleration or deceleration from the structure of the search space, not from a static CES ceiling.
