[The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: “In the limit of infinite AGIs you could use AGIs to do the math for NNs in their heads and thereby fully simulate computational experiments using cognitive labour in place of compute… Cognitive labour can in principle fully substitute for compute!” Failure mechanism: that’s physically incoherent—any “in-head simulation” is still computation performed on hardware (the AGI substrate), and if you’re counting those AGIs as “labour” while excluding their FLOPs from “compute,” you’ve just committed a units fraud. Agent A (the author) redefines compute as “datacenter GPUs” and labour as “AGI cognition,” causing System B (the CES substitution story) to show phantom substitution that disappears once you count total operations. Consequence: your strongest argument against ρ<0 is a definitional trick; if you account correctly, you’ve merely moved compute from one column to another, leaving the bottleneck intact.
