> The "do the math in their heads" argument for substituting cognition for compute is circular—mental simulation *is* compute, so it doesn't actually show the bottleneck can be bypassed.

**“Mental Simulation Smuggles in Compute”** — The paper’s toy argument that infinite AGIs could “do the math for NNs in their heads” is used to suggest that, in principle, cognitive labour can substitute for compute, weakening ρ<0 in the limit. But the mechanism fails under the paper’s own premise of holding compute fixed: those AGIs’ “heads” are compute, so any faithful simulation of training dynamics is just compute consumption in disguise, not a free substitute. If “in-head simulation” is merely shifting FLOPs from “training runs” to “agent cognition,” then the bottleneck remains a compute budget constraint, not a substitutability win. If this objection holds, the paper should drop this as evidence for higher ρ and instead argue with concrete, compute-cheap research pathways whose validity can be established without frontier-scale execution.
