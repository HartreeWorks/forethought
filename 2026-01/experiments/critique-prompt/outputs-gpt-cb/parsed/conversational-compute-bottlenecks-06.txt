> Even if AI can generate improvements faster, shipping them safely requires expensive evaluation, red-teaming, and alignment work that scales *up* with capability—so real-world progress may bottleneck on validation, not idea generation.

**"Evaluation, interpretability, and safety constraints can be the real rate-limiters"**  
The argument largely treats “pace of software progress” as gated by idea generation and empirical testing. But capability progress in deployed or usable systems may be gated by evaluation (detecting failures), interpretability, robustness work, red-teaming, and alignment mitigations—activities that can require massive compute themselves (e.g., adversarial training, extensive RLHF/RLAIF, automated auditing, large-scale eval suites). Even if you can propose many improvements quickly, you might not be willing (or legally able) to ship or rely on them until they pass expensive and time-consuming validation. This creates a bottleneck that does not vanish with more cognitive labor; it often becomes *harder* as capabilities rise and stakes increase. If these constraints bind, an “SIE in the lab” may fail to translate into an “SIE in the world.”
