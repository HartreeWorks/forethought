**Node attacked:** “*in the limit of infinite AGIs you could use AGIs to do the math for NNs in their heads and thereby fully simulate computational experiments using cognitive labour in place of compute… Cognitive labour can in principle fully substitute for compute!*” (Counterargument 2.3). **Attack type:** Countermodel. **Break mechanism:** “Doing the math in their heads” is still computation performed on a physical substrate; unless you assume “cognitive labor” is magically compute-free, this just relocates compute from “experiment machines” to “AGI brains.” In a physically realistic world, the AGIs’ thinking consumes the same scarce FLOPs/energy/memory bandwidth that you counted as K, so the apparent substitution is double-counting: L rises only by spending more K. Under that accounting, ρ can remain <0 even “in principle,” because the relevant constraint is total available physical computation, not whether it is labeled “researcher cognition” or “training run.” **If this holds, you’d need to explicitly define K as *total physical compute budget including inference/thinking* and re-argue substitutability under that unified constraint (or else show why “AGI cognition” draws from a different, non-competing resource).**
