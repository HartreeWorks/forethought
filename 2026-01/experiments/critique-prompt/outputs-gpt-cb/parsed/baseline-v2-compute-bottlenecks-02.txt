"Unjustified Parameter Fixing (α = 0.5) Drives the ‘Max Speed’" — The paper repeatedly assumes α = 0.5 “throughout,” treating compute and cognitive labor as equally weighted inputs, then translates ρ values into dramatic “max speed” ceilings. But α is not a cosmetic parameter here: for ρ < 0, the asymptotic ceiling depends heavily on α, and small changes can move the ceiling by large factors. In AI R&D, the “share” of tasks done by compute versus cognition is precisely what is contested, and plausibly varies by phase (architecture search vs debugging vs evaluation vs scaling). Holding α fixed while letting L vary by orders of magnitude bakes in a contentious division of labor rather than discovering one. This undermines the paper’s numerical claims (e.g., “ρ=-0.2 implies ~30×”) because those numbers may be mostly an artifact of α rather than informative about compute bottlenecks.
