**"The CES framing may be the wrong abstraction, but that doesn’t imply weak bottlenecks"**  
The paper spends substantial effort arguing that importing CES-style elasticities from manufacturing is dubious, but undermining that particular estimate doesn’t establish that compute bottlenecks are mild. AI R&D could be bottlenecked in ways that a CES model fails to capture (e.g., discrete “must-run” frontier trainings, long feedback cycles, or reliability constraints), which could be *more* binding than CES complementarity suggests. In other words, “CES extrapolation is heroic” is compatible with “compute limits still dominate,” because the true production function could be even harsher. The critique is that the paper often treats “economist argument is fragile” as evidence for “SIE likely survives compute limits,” when it may only justify agnosticism. A stronger case would require a positive, empirically grounded alternative model of how software progress scales with fixed compute.
