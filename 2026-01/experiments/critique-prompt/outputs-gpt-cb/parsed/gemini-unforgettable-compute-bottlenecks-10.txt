**"Your definition of SIE (‘effective training compute’) lets you declare explosion without intelligence, and dodge the actual bottleneck."** The paper operationalizes SIE as “>=5 OOM increase in effective training compute in <1 year without more hardware,” equating algorithmic efficiency gains with an “intelligence explosion.” But effective compute is not capability: you can get huge paper gains in efficiency metrics by narrowing task distribution, exploiting benchmark artifacts, or shifting to architectures that are cheaper but brittle—none of which implies the ability to automate AI R&D at superhuman levels. This definition makes the conclusion easier by redefining the target into something that can rise on paper while the actual system-level constraint—reliable, frontier-generalizing performance under real-world distribution shift—still demands expensive training and evaluation. That’s a vacuous-truth failure mode: the thesis becomes true in a world where “effective compute” explodes but the promised feedback loop (AI improving AI) stalls because the systems aren’t robust enough to replace researchers. If the author defends by saying “effective compute correlates with capability,” they must confront the exact crux compute-bottleneck skeptics press: correlation breaks at regime changes, and demonstrating it holds is itself compute-intensive.
