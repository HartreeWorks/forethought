The paper’s most load-bearing “rug pull” is: “when algorithms become twice as efficient, you can run twice as many experiments (holding capability fixed), so during an SIE labs can increase both cognitive labour and # experiments; this undermines the objection that an essential input is fixed.” This relies on a hidden lemma that the experiments that matter for accelerating progress are not the near-frontier experiments whose cost scales with the frontier, but cheaper experiments whose count can grow as efficiency improves. Counter-model: algorithmic ideas are systematically misleading at small scale due to scaling pathologies (optimization instabilities, emergent behaviors, data mixture effects), so the only experiments that discriminate between competing approaches are near-frontier trainings/evals; efficiency improvements that look good at small scale do not buy you “more relevant experiments” unless you spend compute near the frontier anyway. Then “twice as efficient” does not yield twice the *decision-relevant* experiments; it yields more cheap noise while the bottlenecked frontier queue remains fixed, so acceleration stalls early. If this holds, the author must revise the argument to distinguish “experiment count” from “information gain about frontier performance,” and show that information gain per unit compute increases fast enough to overcome the fixed near-frontier budget.
