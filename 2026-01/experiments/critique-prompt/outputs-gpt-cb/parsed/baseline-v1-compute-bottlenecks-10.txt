The conclusion assigns a 10–40% probability to an SIE under a specific definition (≥5 OOM effective training compute in <1 year without more hardware), but the paper doesn’t provide a probabilistic model that connects the earlier qualitative points to those numbers. Key parameters (distribution over ρ, rate of algorithmic efficiency gains, experiment-to-insight elasticity, coordination overhead) are neither quantified nor sensitivity-tested in a way that yields that probability range. This makes the headline credences look impressionistic and potentially overconfident given the acknowledged uncertainty.
