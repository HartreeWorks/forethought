"The Pace/Capability Conflation" — Your \(Y\) is “pace of AI software progress,” but later you operationalize SIE as “\(\ge 5\) OOM increase in effective training compute in <1 year,” implicitly equating “software progress” with “effective compute multipliers.” The inference you rely on is that faster algorithmic R&D translates straightforwardly into capability acceleration, yet the mapping breaks because many “software improvements” shift what is being optimized (data quality, objectives, post-training, scaffolding) and don’t act like multiplicative compute. Step-by-step: an R&D breakthrough might increase sample-efficiency but require more data curation, longer context, or heavier inference-time search; your metric counts it as “effective training compute” while the real bottleneck moves to tokens, memory bandwidth, or inference latency—still hardware-tied. If this objection holds, you need a single consistent capability metric and a conversion model from algorithmic changes to that metric’s hardware demands, instead of treating “effective training compute” as a universal numeraire.
