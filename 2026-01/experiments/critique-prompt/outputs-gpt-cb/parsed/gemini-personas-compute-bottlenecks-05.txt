[The Historical Parallelist] Target claim: “Cobb Douglas is a good model for long-run growth… in the longer run we invent new production processes… and so ρ is higher… this reconfiguration could be very quick with fast-thinking AGIs!” Failure mechanism: you’re recycling the classic “organizational adaptation is fast once ideas exist” myth; historically, the bottleneck is not ideation speed but integration constraints (toolchains, safety processes, tacit knowledge, institutional friction). Agent A (a lab) tries to “reconfigure AI R&D in days or weeks,” causing System B (research throughput) to crater because the new pipeline breaks reproducibility, destroys institutional memory, and floods the org with unvalidated results. Consequence: instead of an SIE, you get a reliability collapse where apparent iteration accelerates but real progress stalls under coordination debt—exactly the pattern seen in past tech booms where “we’ll just reorganize faster” failed.
