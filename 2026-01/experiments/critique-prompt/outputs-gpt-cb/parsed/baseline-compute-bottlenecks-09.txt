The “strongest-link” framing (many routes to progress, only one needs to work) is presented as undermining CES complementarity, but it doesn’t show that any route actually has high substitutability with compute. Several proposed routes—scaffolding, data flywheels, better experiments—still rely on training, evaluation, and deployment at scale, each of which can be compute-heavy. Without identifying at least one plausible high-ρ pathway with evidence, the strongest-link argument remains speculative.
