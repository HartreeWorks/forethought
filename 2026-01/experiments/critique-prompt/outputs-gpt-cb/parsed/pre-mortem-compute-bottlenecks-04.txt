**“Head-Math Substitution Fantasy”** — To argue ρ could be near 0, the paper gestured at the limiting idea that abundant AGIs could “do the math for NNs in their heads,” showing cognitive labour can, in principle, substitute for compute. In practice, that rhetorical move shaped 2027–2031 policy: multiple governments concluded that chip supply constraints were strategically less important because software/agent labour could route around hardware, so they underinvested in fabrication, energy buildout, and high-bandwidth interconnects. The broken mechanism was the physical reality that “thinking” *is* computation with hard thermodynamic, latency, and memory-I/O costs; attempts to replace training runs with “internal simulation” simply shifted costs into even less efficient inference and verification workloads. The cascade was geopolitical and economic: compute scarcity *increased*, labs hoarded clusters, black markets for datacenter power expanded, and national AI programs missed targets because the supposed compute substitution never materialized. The paper missed how its “in principle” substitution argument, once laundered into policy, encouraged neglect of the very physical constraints that dominated real-world throughput.
