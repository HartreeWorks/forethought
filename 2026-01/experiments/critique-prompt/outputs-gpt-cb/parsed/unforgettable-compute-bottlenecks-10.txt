**"Compute Allocation Becomes an Adversarial Game"** — The paper argues that **holding compute constant, more automated R&D labor can still drive rapid progress**, because **the key question is technical substitutability (ρ) rather than institutional dynamics**. But in an actual SIE scenario, compute is not just an input; it is a strategic asset with attack surfaces, theft incentives, and deployment payoffs, and those pressures change how much compute can be devoted to R&D versus defense, monitoring, productization, and containment. As AI systems become capable, labs may be forced to sandbox, gate, and heavily monitor internal agents (and their outputs), imposing large overhead that effectively reduces usable K for experiments and increases the marginal cost of each additional “researcher-agent.” Bad actors can also deliberately force a compute bottleneck (e.g., via cyber sabotage, model theft prompting arms-race deployment, or compute denial) exactly because the paper’s story makes R&D speed so decisive. If this holds, the paper would need to treat K as an endogenous, contested resource with security/overhead terms that scale with capability—otherwise the conclusion “bottlenecks bite late” could flip to “bottlenecks bite early via governance and security costs,” even if the pure technical ρ were high.
