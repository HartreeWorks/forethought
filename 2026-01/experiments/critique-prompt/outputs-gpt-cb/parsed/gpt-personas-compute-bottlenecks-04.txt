[The Institutional Corruption Realist] **Target claim:** “economic estimates are a weak prior; we should raise ρ and be more aggressive in SIE forecasts.” **Failure mechanism (incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift):** your reasoning hands regulated actors the perfect rhetorical weapon: “compute isn’t the bottleneck, software progress is—so compute governance won’t meaningfully slow things.” In equilibrium, labs will selectively cite your “near 0 ρ is plausible” and “heroic extrapolation makes low ρ shaky” lines to argue against hard compute caps, while simultaneously marketing unverifiable “algorithmic efficiency” gains to justify more deployment and more capital. **Consequence:** the institutional effect of your argument is asymmetric: it’s far more likely to be used to launder acceleration (“software will race anyway”) than to motivate robust controls, pushing the world toward exactly the fast, under-supervised regime you describe as catastrophic.
