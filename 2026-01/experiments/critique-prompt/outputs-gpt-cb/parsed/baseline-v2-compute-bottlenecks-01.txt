> Mapping a CES production function designed for GDP onto "AI software progress" is a category error—the ceiling on progress speed may just be an artifact of imposing smooth substitution logic on a domain defined by discontinuous breakthroughs and shifting metrics.

"The CES Mapping Category Error" — The paper’s core move is to apply a CES production function (developed for GDP from labor and physical capital) to “pace of AI software progress” from “cognitive labor” and “compute.” That mapping is not defended beyond analogy, yet the conclusion depends on it: that a negative ρ implies a hard ceiling on progress speed. “Output” in CES is a flow of goods/services with market prices, while “AI software progress” is a poorly-defined research outcome with nonstationary metrics, shifting targets, and path dependence. R&D outputs are also often discontinuous (rare breakthroughs) and option-like, which violates the smooth marginal substitution logic that makes CES tractable. Without an argument that the CES form is even approximately appropriate for research production, the ceiling and “max speed” results look like artifacts of a convenient functional form rather than genuine constraints.
