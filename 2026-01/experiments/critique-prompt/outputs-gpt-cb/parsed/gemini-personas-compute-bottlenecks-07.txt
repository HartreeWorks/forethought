[The Institutional Corruptionist] Target claim: “I’ll assume α=0.5 throughout… economic estimates provide only a weak prior… I expect −0.2<ρ<0.” Failure mechanism: you’re pretending these parameters are empirical when they’re just vibes, and that invites regulatory/board-level theatre where decision-makers cherry-pick ρ to justify whichever narrative serves them (arms race or complacency). Agent A (a frontier lab) picks ρ≈0 in public to argue “takeoff could be fast, so we must scale now,” while internally using ρ<<0 to argue “safety can wait, compute will bottleneck anyway,” causing System B (governance, oversight, and resource allocation) to become pure narrative manipulation. Consequence: your framework becomes a capture tool: parameters as propaganda, not science, enabling exactly the reckless acceleration you claim to be analyzing.
