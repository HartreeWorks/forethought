"The Alpha Smuggling Problem" — A load-bearing move is fixing \(\alpha=0.5\) and then using “implausibly low max speed” to dismiss most negative-\(\rho\) estimates. But in CES, the ceiling under complementarity is extremely sensitive to \(\alpha\): if the compute share of effective production is high (large \(\alpha\)), the ceiling collapses even when \(\rho\) is only mildly negative. Step-by-step: your “max speed” numbers (2–100+) are computed under an arbitrary split; change \(\alpha\) to reflect the reality that ML progress is dominated by compute-heavy training runs and the same \(\rho\) implies single-digit ceilings; then your “economic estimates imply absurd ceilings” argument evaporates. If this objection holds, you must estimate \(\alpha\) from concrete AI-R&D resource splits (training runs, eval suites, hyperparameter sweeps, inference for automated researchers) and redo the ceiling calculations; without that, the central numerical intuition pump is not anchored.
