> The rejection of certain ρ values rests on an intuition about what superintelligent researchers "should" achieve, but that intuition presupposes the very thing the compute-bottleneck debate is trying to resolve.

"From ‘Max Speed Seems Implausible’ to ‘ρ Must Be Higher’ Is Not an Argument" — A key argumentative pivot is: economic ρ estimates imply low “max speed,” low max speed feels implausible to the author, therefore “most likely, −0.2 < ρ < 0.” This is largely an intuition pump rather than an inference: it relies on informal imagination about what “trillions of maximally superintelligent AI researchers” could do, without specifying the actual constraints (experiment latency, validation, integration, safety, deployment, diminishing idea value). The paper acknowledges that this could be “its own post,” which highlights that the central premise—what max speed should be—is not established. Moreover, “implausible” depends on background assumptions about how much of progress is idea-limited versus experiment-limited, and those are precisely what the compute-bottleneck debate concerns. If the max-speed intuition is wrong (e.g., because most gains require frontier training and long-horizon validation), then the paper’s preferred ρ range collapses. As written, the argument risks being question-begging: it rejects ρ values mainly because they conflict with the author’s prior expectations about acceleration.
