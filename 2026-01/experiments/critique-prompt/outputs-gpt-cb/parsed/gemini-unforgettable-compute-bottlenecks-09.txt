**"The strongest-link escape (‘many routes not bottlenecked by compute’) is vacuous unless you name one route that survives contact with reality."** The paper argues the compute bottleneck objection only works if *all* routes to superintelligence are compute-bottlenecked, implying that one non-compute-intensive route could carry an SIE. But this “strongest link” framing is an existence proof without an existence argument: it doesn’t specify any concrete path from current ML to “>=5 OOM effective training compute in <1 year” that doesn’t require extensive empirical validation at or near the frontier. In modern ML, even “non-training” routes (scaffolding, data flywheels, architecture changes) still bottleneck on evaluation, robustness testing, and distribution-shift probing—each demanding substantial compute to avoid self-deception. The move isn’t optimistic; it’s unfalsifiable: any observed compute constraint can be waved away by gesturing at an unspecified alternative route. If the author defends by proposing a candidate route, they inherit the burden they’ve been avoiding: to show it doesn’t secretly require the compute-heavy experiments the objection is about.
