> The critique's list of things extra cognitive labour *could* do never shows those gains survive integration costs and sequential validation bottlenecks, so a low max-speed ceiling remains perfectly plausible.

**“‘Max Speed Is Implausibly Low’ Is a Mirror of the Conclusion”** (attacks **Pivot P5: “Economic ρ estimates imply max speed 2–100×; max speed below ~10–30× is implausible; therefore economic estimates likely overstate bottlenecks and −0.2<ρ<0 is most likely.”** This pivot is load-bearing because it justifies discounting the main quantitative objection from economics and supports the 10–40% probability.) The “implausibly low” judgment is driven by an inventory of things abundant cognitive labor *could* do (optimize stack, early stopping, better ideas), but it doesn’t show those actions translate into proportional *validated progress* once you account for integration costs, regressions, and the need to confirm gains at relevant scales. If, in reality, the binding constraint is “number of high-confidence, high-scale validations per unit time,” then a 6× or even 10× ceiling is not implausible—it’s exactly what you’d expect under fixed compute and sequential validation. If that’s true, the paper’s posterior (“good chance bottlenecks don’t slow until late; 10–40% SIE despite bottlenecks”) is too high because the economics-based low max-speed world remains live. What would need to change is a quantitative upper-bound argument (or simulation) translating proposed labor-driven improvements into expected progress per unit of fixed compute, with uncertainty bands wide enough to honestly compare against ρ≈−0.4 worlds.
