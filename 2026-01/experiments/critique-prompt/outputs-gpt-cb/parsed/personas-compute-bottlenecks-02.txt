[The Mechanism Designer] The claim that “in the limit of infinite AGIs you could do the math for NNs in their heads and fully simulate computational experiments using cognitive labour in place of compute” tries to break the compute ceiling by redefining compute as “thinking.” But those AGIs are instantiated on the same physical compute substrate you are supposedly holding fixed, so “cognitive labour” is not an independent input—your L is literally carved out of K. The paper never formally specifies the resource accounting: what fraction of inference FLOPs per AGI-hour replaces what fraction of training FLOPs per experiment, and how memory bandwidth/communication are handled when “in-head simulation” scales. Without a formal model, this move is equivalent to claiming a perpetual motion machine inside the CES framework by double-counting the same hardware as both L and K. If this objection holds, your key escape hatch (“ρ can approach 0 because labour can substitute for compute”) collapses, and the ceiling reappears as a hard budget constraint on total FLOPs and memory traffic.
