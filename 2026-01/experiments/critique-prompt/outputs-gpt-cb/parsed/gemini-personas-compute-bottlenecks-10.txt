[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: “It’s plausible that compute bottlenecks don’t slow an SIE until its late stages… early stages unaffected within −0.2<ρ<0.” Failure mechanism: even if the math were right, the strategic response makes compute a bottleneck by sabotage and denial: actors constrain rivals’ compute supply (export controls, supply-chain attacks, power rationing, model-weight theft prompting defensive retraining) precisely because your story says compute scarcity is the lever that stops takeoff. Agent A (a geopolitical adversary) attacks datacenters and chip supply, causing System B (the supposed smooth SIE trajectory) to collapse into discontinuous, security-driven retraining cycles that waste compute and amplify opacity. Consequence: your “late-stage bottleneck” narrative becomes a blueprint for conflict escalation around compute infrastructure, increasing systemic risk and making outcomes more violent and less governable than the baseline you’re comparing against.
