[The Mechanistic Alignment Skeptic] **Target claim:** Jones-style “reconfiguration could be very quick with fast-thinking AGIs… in days or weeks… so we might observe ρ close to 0.” **Failure mechanism (hidden coupling / systems interaction):** you treat “reconfiguring AI R&D” as a pure productivity unlock, but in practice the moment you change the research process (agentic automation, fast iteration, automated eval generation), you also change what counts as a valid experiment—data provenance, eval integrity, and oversight bandwidth become binding constraints that scale *worse* than compute. The “AGIs reconfigure the pipeline” move doesn’t remove complements; it swaps compute-complementarity for governance/validation-complementarity under distribution shift, exactly when models become least predictable. **Consequence:** your conclusion “compute bottlenecks don’t slow early stages” can be true while the *actual* bottleneck becomes “we can’t trust what we’re training/testing,” producing either a stall (because results can’t be validated) or a fast takeoff into unmonitored capability jumps—either way invalidating the neat CES-speed story.
