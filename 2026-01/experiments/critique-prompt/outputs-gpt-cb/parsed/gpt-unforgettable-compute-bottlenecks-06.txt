"The ρ-by-Intuition Circularity" — A central argumentative step is: economic \(\rho\) values imply low max speeds; low max speeds feel implausible given what “abundant cognitive labor” could do; therefore \(\rho\) for AI R&D is closer to 0. That is circular because the only concrete content behind “implausible” is exactly the claim at issue—high substitutability between labor and compute in producing algorithmic progress. Step-by-step: you translate \(\rho\) into a ceiling; reject ceilings using scenarios (better ideas, better experiments, stack optimization) whose success depends on compute not being the bottleneck; then conclude compute isn’t the bottleneck. If this objection holds, you must replace the “implausible max speed” move with an independent identifiability story—some observable, present-day statistic that pins down substitutability in AI R&D without assuming the conclusion.
