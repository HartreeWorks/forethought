> Saying AGIs could "do the math in their heads" to replace compute just moves the bottleneck rather than eliminating it—thinking still runs on physical substrates with real energy, bandwidth, and latency constraints.

"The ‘AGIs Can Simulate Compute in Their Heads’ Escape Hatch" — The toy claim that with infinite AGIs “you could use AGIs to do the math for NNs in their heads and thereby fully simulate computational experiments using cognitive labour in place of compute” is doing heavy conceptual work: it is used to argue that ρ < 0 is “flawed in the absolute limit.” But this trades on an equivocation about what compute is: if the AGI is doing the math, it is still implementing computation on some physical substrate with energy, time, and hardware constraints, so the bottleneck hasn’t disappeared—its accounting has moved. Moreover, the relevant constraint is not abstract Turing-computability but physical throughput (memory bandwidth, interconnect, energy, latency), which “thinking” cannot bypass. Invoking an “in principle” substitution conflates logical possibility with economically and physically feasible substitution, which is precisely what bottleneck arguments are about. This weakens the paper because it suggests that extreme-limit intuitions are being used to undercut a constraint that is fundamentally physical.
