[The Game-Theoretic Defector] **Target claim:** the core exercise of “hold compute constant and ask whether software progress can explode anyway.” **Failure mechanism (incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift):** in any competitive equilibrium, “holding compute fixed” is not a stable action—algorithmic efficiency immediately increases the marginal ROI of buying/stealing/renting compute, so actors reinvest and K endogenously rises. Your whole “compute bottlenecks might not bite until late stages” framing is built around a counterfactual that no leading lab (or state) will sit still in, especially once automation makes scaling decisions faster than human governance cycles. **Consequence:** even if your argument about high substitutability were right, the real-world outcome is likely not “software-only SIE under fixed K,” but an accelerated hardware arms race where compute constraints, export controls, sabotage, and power/energy constraints dominate—i.e., the bottleneck you tried to dismiss returns as the main driver via equilibrium behavior.
