[The Institutional Corruptionist] You implicitly invite readers to focus on “compute bottlenecks” as a measurable limiting factor, then argue they may not matter until late stages, which nudges governance thinking toward tracking compute and relaxing early concern. But compute accounting is the perfect domain for compliance theatre: labs can underreport training runs, relabel experiments as “inference,” shard workloads across affiliates, or use third-party cloud and overseas clusters specifically to evade scrutiny. Because your “SIE” definition is “≥5 OOM increase in effective training compute in <1 year without more hardware,” the obvious incentive is to game the “effective” part—claim algorithmic efficiency gains while hiding the real compute spend and evaluation failures. You don’t address principal-agent failures inside firms (safety/compliance teams versus product orgs) that systematically bias reported efficiency upward. If this objection holds, any strategy that leans on “we’ll notice compute bottlenecks/thresholds as they approach” fails, and a putative SIE could proceed in a fog of manipulated metrics.
