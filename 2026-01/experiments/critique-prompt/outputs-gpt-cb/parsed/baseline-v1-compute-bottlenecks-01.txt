The paper assumes that AI R&D can be modeled by a two-input production function with “cognitive labor” and “compute” as separable factors, but it never justifies that these are the right primitives. Key drivers like data quality, organizational coordination, latency/throughput constraints, and evaluation/verification effort may not be reducible to either input. If the input decomposition is wrong, inferences about “bottlenecks” from ρ become largely ungrounded.
