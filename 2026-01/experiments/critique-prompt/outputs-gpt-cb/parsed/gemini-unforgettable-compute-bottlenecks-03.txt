**"The ‘simulate NNs in their heads’ escape hatch detonates your own definition of compute bottleneck."** The paper’s key rebuttal to \( \rho<0 \) leans on the idea that with enough cognitive labor, AGIs could “do the math for NNs in their heads” and thus substitute for compute, so a hard compute bottleneck can’t exist “in principle.” But “doing the math in their heads” is just computation performed somewhere else; for AI agents those “heads” are still hardware executing operations, i.e., compute. This is a load-bearing metaphor treated as a factual counterexample: it confuses relocating compute with eliminating compute, and thereby dissolves the bottleneck by redefining compute out of existence. That’s not a rebuttal to compute constraints; it’s a tautology (“compute isn’t limiting because we can compute”). If the author tries to defend by insisting cognitive labor could be non-digital (humans, wetware), they’ve abandoned the paper’s scenario of software R&D automation driving the explosion—switching substrate is exactly “additional hardware” by another name.
