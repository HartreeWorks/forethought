**“Mental Simulation Smuggles in Compute”** (attacks **Pivot P2: “In the limit of infinite AGIs you could… fully simulate computational experiments using cognitive labour in place of compute… meaning ρ<0 is flawed in the absolute limit.”** This pivot is load-bearing because it underwrites the intuition that compute can be substituted away, pushing ρ toward 0.) Simulating neural network training “in their heads” doesn’t bypass computation; it just relocates it to whatever physical substrate runs those AGIs, which is still constrained by FLOPs, memory bandwidth, and energy—i.e., *compute* in the relevant sense. If the substrate is the same hardware pool, then “more AGIs” doesn’t create extra physical operations; it partitions the same compute budget, worsening contention rather than substituting for it. Once you remove this substitution intuition, it becomes entirely coherent that even superintelligent researchers face a hard cap from fixed experimental compute, making negative ρ plausible in the regime the paper cares about. What would need to change is replacing the “cognition can substitute for compute” argument with a physically grounded account of what parts of R&D can be advanced without additional executed operations (e.g., theorem-proving style progress) and showing those parts dominate the pathway to superintelligence.
