**"Data and environment interaction can bottleneck empirical progress independently of compute"**  
Compute is not the only empirical input: high-quality data, high-signal feedback, and rich environments for learning (including tool APIs, simulators, or real-world interaction) can become limiting. As models saturate existing text/code corpora, progress may require new data generation that is bottlenecked by human processes, real-world time, access constraints, or complex simulations that are themselves compute-heavy. If frontier gains increasingly come from embodied interaction, long-horizon tasks, or domain-specific proprietary data, then “more AI researchers” won’t substitute smoothly. This challenges the paper’s focus on compute substitutability as the decisive issue, because the real complementarity might be between cognition and scarce data/feedback channels. Under that view, compute bottlenecks might arrive “late,” but other bottlenecks could arrive early and still block explosion dynamics.
