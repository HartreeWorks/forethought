> The "strongest-link" rebuttal assumes at least one route to superintelligence can dodge compute constraints, but never actually identifies such a route or explains why candidate pathways wouldn't all hit the same compute-intensive bottlenecks.

"The ‘Strongest-Link’ Framing Mischaracterizes the Objection It’s Rejecting" — The paper claims the CES framing is “weakest link” and proposes a “strongest link” alternative: many routes to progress exist and you only need one not bottlenecked by compute. But compute-bottleneck skeptics can accept multiple routes while still arguing that each plausible route has a compute-heavy component (training, evaluation, search, data processing, or environment simulation). The paper doesn’t identify a concrete route that demonstrably scales to superintelligence with substantially sub-frontier compute, nor does it show that the relevant route remains available once easy gains are exhausted. In practice, “routes” are not independent: many rely on the same compute-intensive substrate (large-scale training plus extensive evaluation), so they can be bottlenecked together. The strongest-link move therefore reads more like a hope that some path will be compute-light than a rebuttal to the claim that compute constraints are pervasive across candidate pathways. Without specifying which route dominates and why it evades compute limits, the argument undercuts the objection rhetorically rather than analytically.
