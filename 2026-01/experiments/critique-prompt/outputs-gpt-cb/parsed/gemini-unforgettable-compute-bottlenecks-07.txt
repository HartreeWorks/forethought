**"You attack ‘heroic extrapolation’ and then immediately bet your conclusion on an even more heroic extrapolation."** The paper argues that using CES estimates from small \(L/K\) variation to predict many-orders-of-magnitude changes is “truly heroic,” suggesting we should be very wary of such inference. But the paper’s bottom line still depends on choosing a narrow favorable range \(-0.2<\rho<0\) and then extrapolating that range through 5+ OOMs of labor increase to claim compute bottlenecks “won’t bite until late stages.” That is the same extrapolation move, just with a hand-picked parameter justified by plausibility arguments rather than data. The critique isn’t “you need better estimates”; it’s that the paper invalidates its own inferential machinery and then uses it anyway to produce policy-relevant probabilities (10–40%). If the author defends by saying “it’s only a guess,” then the paper’s central purpose—defusing the compute bottleneck objection—collapses into an admission that the objection remains standing.
