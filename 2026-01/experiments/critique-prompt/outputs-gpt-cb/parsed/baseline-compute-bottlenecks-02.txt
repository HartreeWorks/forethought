The mapping from CES “output” (Y) to “pace of AI software progress” is under-argued and potentially invalid. Economic production functions typically model levels of output, not rates of innovation, and translating a static production relationship into a dynamic claim about acceleration requires additional assumptions about knowledge accumulation and diminishing returns. Without those bridging assumptions, the ceiling-on-speed interpretation may be a category mistake.
