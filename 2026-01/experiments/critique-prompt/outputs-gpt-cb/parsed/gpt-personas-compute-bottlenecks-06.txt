[The Capability Externalist] **Target claim:** “experiments can become more compute-efficient… so labs can increase # experiments even with fixed compute, pulling the rug out from the bottleneck argument.” **Failure mechanism (hidden coupling / systems interaction):** algorithmic efficiency doesn’t just “create more experiments”; it lowers the effective price of capability, which increases the demand for compute and the strategic value of scaling—so the system response is more capital allocation to chips, datacenters, and energy. In other words, your ‘software substitutes for compute’ story endogenously changes K through investment and geopolitics, and the world’s limiting factor becomes supply chains, power grids, and chip control—not “fixed K.” **Consequence:** your “good chance compute bottlenecks don’t slow early” conclusion is unstable: efficiency gains can *accelerate* the approach to hard physical and geopolitical constraints, producing earlier conflict/controls/shortages that interrupt the SIE in ways your model treats as irrelevant.
