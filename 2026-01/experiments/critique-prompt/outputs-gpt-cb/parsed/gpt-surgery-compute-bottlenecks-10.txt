**Node attacked:** “*I’ll define an ‘SIE’ as ‘>=5 OOMs of increase in effective training compute in <1 years without needing more hardware’*” (Taking stock). **Attack type:** Quantitative cliff (accounting inconsistency). **Break mechanism:** “Effective training compute” folds multiple margins (algorithmic efficiency, data efficiency, architectural changes, tooling) into a single scalar, but your own discussion repeatedly treats compute as both the bottleneck input K and something that can be “effectively increased” via software—creating a moving-target denominator. A counterworld: you achieve large “effective compute” gains only by shifting costs to inference-time search, larger context, heavier tool use, or more extensive evaluation; total physical compute remains binding, so the “no more hardware” clause fails under full-system accounting even if training FLOPs drop. Also, if you instantiate “millions of AGIs,” their inference/thinking compute can dominate the budget, making the constraint tighter exactly during the putative explosion. **If this holds, you’d need to specify a conservation-style compute budget over (training + inference for researchers + evaluation + deployment externalities), define “effective compute” in a way that can’t be inflated by shifting work across buckets, and then re-check whether 5 OOM in <1 year is achievable under that unified constraint.**
