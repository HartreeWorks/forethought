The toy argument that “in the limit of infinite AGIs you could use AGIs to do the math for NNs in their heads and thereby fully simulate computational experiments using cognitive labour in place of compute” is doing illicit work: it is being used to undermine the absolute validity of \(\rho<0\) by claiming cognition can fully substitute for compute. The hidden lemma is that “AGI cognition” is not itself implemented on compute that draws from the same fixed hardware budget \(K\); but in the scenario under discussion, those AGIs are software running on GPUs/TPUs, so their “thinking” is literally compute consumption. Counter-model: fix hardware; you can allocate it to (a) running AGI “researcher” inference or (b) running training/eval experiments, but both draw from the same compute pool; “simulating experiments in heads” just reallocates compute from explicit training to implicit mental simulation and does not create extra experimental throughput. Under this counter-model, the claimed principled refutation of \(\rho<0\) collapses: compute remains the conserved quantity and cognition cannot escape it. If this holds, the author must drop “AGIs can replace compute” as a substitute-argument and instead argue for a specific, non-handwavy channel where algorithmic progress reduces required *total* compute for frontier-relevant learning (not merely shifts compute between thinking and training).
