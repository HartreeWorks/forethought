The claim that cognitive labor can “in principle fully substitute for compute” via AIs simulating neural nets “in their heads” conflates physical computation with a metaphorical description of cognition. Any “thinking” implemented on hardware still consumes compute; substituting “labor” for compute may just redescribe compute spent elsewhere. This undermines the paper’s suggestion that complementarity must break down in the absolute limit.
