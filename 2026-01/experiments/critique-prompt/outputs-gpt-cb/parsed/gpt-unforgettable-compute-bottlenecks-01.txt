"The Compute Conservation Law" — Your key inference is that we can “pour in” arbitrarily more cognitive labor \(L\) while holding compute \(K\) fixed, and then read a ceiling on “software progress speed” from the CES curve. But in your own setup, the cognitive labor *is* running on compute (training + inference); additional AGI “researchers” are not a free labor input, they are a new compute load that competes with experiment compute on the same hardware budget. Step-by-step: fixed hardware ⇒ fixed FLOP/s ⇒ any increase in AGI-thought-hours diverts FLOPs away from running training/ablation experiments ⇒ the supposed movement along the CES “increase \(L\) holding \(K\) fixed” axis is physically blocked. If this objection holds, you need to replace the CES mapping with an explicit compute-allocation model where “research labor” is measured in inference FLOPs and “experiments” in training FLOPs, and show a regime where shifting FLOPs into researcher-inference still increases net algorithmic progress fast enough.
