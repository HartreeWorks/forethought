> Even defining SIE as a 100,000× software-only efficiency gain quietly makes the thesis hostage to hardware throughput, since realistic stacking of efficiency tricks probably caps out far below five orders of magnitude.

**“The SIE Target Metric Quietly Reintroduces Hardware Limits”** (attacks **Pivot P5: “Define SIE as ≥5 OOM increase in effective training compute in <1 year without more hardware; compute bottlenecks probably don’t block this until late stages.”** This pivot is load-bearing because the headline probability is stated in this metric.) With fixed hardware, the total available FLOPs in a year is capped; achieving 5 OOM “effective training compute” implies ~100,000× aggregate efficiency on the tasks that matter, but many efficiency gains require tradeoffs that are not free (more memory, more communication, more wall-clock, or degraded robustness) and may not stack multiplicatively. If the realistic ceiling on software-only efficiency within a year is, say, 10–1,000× (already aggressive), then the paper’s SIE definition becomes unattainable regardless of how favorable ρ is, and the conclusion that compute bottlenecks wait until “late stages” becomes moot—physical throughput binds almost immediately. In that scenario, the 10–40% probability estimate is inflated because it assigns substantial mass to worlds where software produces five orders of magnitude of “effective compute” without corresponding physical throughput. What would need to change is either (a) a capability-based SIE definition decoupled from “effective compute,” or (b) a stepwise efficiency roadmap showing how specific, known bottlenecks (optimizer, architecture, data efficiency, eval, systems) plausibly compound to 100k× within the time/throughput budget of fixed hardware.
