"The ‘AGIs Simulate Compute’ Contradiction" — You use the thought experiment “AGIs do the math for NNs in their heads” to argue that \(\rho<0\) is “flawed in the absolute limit” because cognitive labor can substitute for compute. But by your own framing, those “heads” are implemented on hardware; simulating training inside minds is just relocating the same FLOPs to a different software stack, not eliminating the compute requirement. Mechanism: neural net forward/backprop has an irreducible arithmetic cost; whether executed as “experiment compute” or “researcher thought,” it still burns FLOPs; thus the thought experiment does not establish substitution, it collapses \(L\) back into \(K\). If this objection holds, you need to drop this limit argument entirely or formalize a *non-compute* channel (e.g., closed-form theory that replaces empirical training) and show it can actually deliver frontier gains without empirical verification.
