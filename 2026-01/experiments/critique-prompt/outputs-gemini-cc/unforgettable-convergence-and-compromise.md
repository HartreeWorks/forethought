1. "The Ontological Incompatibility of Moral Trade"
The paper argues that even if ethical views diverge (antirealism), a mostly-great future can be achieved through "moral trade," where different value systems swap resources to maximize their respective goals. This inference fails because it assumes that divergent moral ontologies will remain sufficiently compatible to define "resources" and "trade" in mutually intelligible ways. If antirealism is true to the degree the paper fears, distinct moral intelligences may not merely disagree on what is *good*, but on the fundamental metaphysics of what constitutes a "transaction," an "agent," or a "unit of value." A deep ecologist AI and a hedonistic utilitarian AI may lack the shared substrate to execute a trade, as the former views the commodification of nature required for the trade as an intrinsic harm, while the latter views the ecologist’s refusal to optimize matter as a waste. If values diverge radically, the transaction costs of establishing a shared trading protocol may approach infinity, rendering the "compromise" solution impossible.

2. "The Dissolution of the Trader"
The paper’s optimism about trade (Section 3) relies on the persistence of distinct, stable "owners" or "groups" that can bargain over the future. However, this projects current human individuation onto a post-AGI substrate where the boundaries between agents are likely to dissolve. In a world of digital minds, copyable intelligences, and mergeable utility functions, the concept of "Alice trading with Bob" becomes obsolete; Alice can simply copy herself, absorb Bob, or self-modify to remove the conflict. If the technology required to enable cosmic-scale trade also enables the dissolution of the individual, then "trade" is not the likely mechanism for conflict resolution—imposition or assimilation is. The paper needs to explain why distinct, coherent agents would persist long enough to trade rather than collapsing into a singleton or a fluid, non-transactional soup.

3. "The Functional Attractor Hypothesis"
In Section 2.2, the paper dismisses historical moral progress as likely contingent or Western-biased, arguing that this trend predicts nothing about the future. This ignores the possibility that certain moral values (cooperation, truth-seeking, non-violence) are not just cultural artifacts but *functional attractors* required for any civilization to survive the "time of perils." Just as flight evolved independently because of the physics of air, certain "benevolent" traits may be strictly necessary to navigate the existential risks of the AGI transition without self-destructing. If the only civilizations that reach the stage of cosmic expansion are those that have already converged on cooperative ethics to survive their own power, then WAM-convergence is not a lucky coincidence but a selection effect. The paper treats survival and flourishing as independent variables, failing to account for the possibility that high-fidelity survival *requires* the very ethical convergence the author doubts.

4. "The Architectural Determinism Oversight"
The argument against WAM-convergence in Section 2.4 relies on a Humean separation of belief and desire: knowing what is "right" doesn't guarantee the motivation to do it. This anthropomorphizes AI by assuming future minds must inherit the specific human cognitive architecture that allows for akrasia (weakness of will). However, we are building these minds; there is no law of physics stating that a mind must be capable of believing X is good without being motivated by X. We could architecturally enforce "internalism," where the representation of a moral fact is identical to the instruction to pursue it. If future minds are constructed such that "knowing the good" and "wanting the good" are the same computational state, the paper’s worry about the gap between realism and motivation vanishes.

5. "The Dark Forest of Moral Trade"
The paper acknowledges threats (Section 3.3) but treats them as a tax on value that might be managed; it fails to recognize that the *possibility* of threats might preclude the initial expansion required for the "sailing" analogy. If the author is correct that "bads weigh heavily" and extortion is easier than production, the equilibrium strategy for a rational civilization is not to sail for the island (expansion) but to hide or preemptively destroy potential traders to avoid infinite negative utility. The "trade" scenario assumes a backdrop of secure property rights and non-aggression that usually requires a leviathan to enforce—the very "global dictatorship" the paper earlier critiques. Without a prior explanation of how defense dominates offense in this future, the existence of divergent values suggests a Hobbesian war of all against all, not a marketplace.

6. "The Narcissism of Large Differences"
The paper suggests that trade works best when views are "resource-compatible" (Section 3.1), assuming that different moral views will want different slices of the pie. This underestimates the "totalizing" nature of many probable ethical systems. A negative utilitarian does not want a corner of the galaxy to reduce suffering; they want *all* matter organized to minimize suffering everywhere. A religious fundamentalist does not want a sanctuary; they want universal conversion. If the dominant moral views are absolutist rather than satisficing, the marginal utility of "owning 50% of the universe" is not 50% of the value—it may be zero or negative (due to the existence of the 'sinful' other half). The paper relies on a hidden assumption that future values will be essentially liberal-pluralist, willing to tolerate the existence of "bad" value systems in exchange for their own territory.

7. "The De Dicto / De Re Trap"
The paper places immense weight on the distinction between desiring the good *de dicto* (aiming at "what is best") vs. *de re* (aiming at specific things like "happiness"). The author argues that without *de dicto* motivation, we miss the narrow target. This sets the bar for success impossibly high, effectively defining "success" in a way that excludes robust "overlapping consensus." In reality, successful coordination rarely requires agreement on abstract principles; it requires agreement on low-level outcomes. If 99% of "mostly-great" futures look like "nobody is in agony and people are happy," it does not matter if agents pursue this for divergent *de re* reasons. By demanding *de dicto* convergence, the author turns a practical engineering problem (outcome coordination) into a philosophical purity test, creating a pessimist conclusion by definition rather than evidence.

8. "The Paradox of Leverage"
In Section 5, the paper argues we should act on the assumption of Scenario 3 (convergence is possible) because that is where we have leverage. This reasoning is vulnerable to a "fanaticism" objection: it encourages optimizing for a potentially negligible slice of probability space at the expense of robust strategies. If Scenario 1 (no convergence) is overwhelmingly likely, acting as if Scenario 3 is true might actively harm the outcome in Scenario 1—for example, by empowering a centralizing force (hoping it converges) that ultimately becomes a permanent totalitarian lock-in (when it doesn't). The paper needs to show that strategies for Scenario 3 are "safe fails" for Scenario 1, otherwise, the normative boomerang effect applies: the advice to "aim for the narrow target" might cause us to miss the broad, "okay" targets that were actually achievable.

9. "The Instrumentality of Intrinsic Goods"
The paper argues in Section 4.2 that "instrumental goods" (like knowledge or complexity) aren't enough to secure a mostly-great future because they are merely means to an end. This creates a false dichotomy. In a post-AGI context, "instrumental convergence" suggests that almost *any* agent will maximize attributes like intelligence, resource acquisition, and freedom of action. If "flourishing" is defined broadly, these instrumental drives look identical to intrinsic goods for vast stretches of time. A civilization maximizing strictly instrumental control over its environment will look indistinguishable from one valuing "engineering feats" or "life proliferation" for billions of years. The paper undercounts how much of "eutopia" is actually just the successful execution of instrumental sub-goals, meaning "blind" self-interest gets us much closer to the target than the author admits.

10. "The Ephemeral Lock-in"
The entire "aiming" metaphor presumes that there is a specific moment of "lock-in" where the trajectory is set forever (Section 2.5). However, if the future involves superintelligent entities capable of self-editing, values may never lock in; they may remain fluid, subject to drift, drift, and re-negotiation indefinitely. If values are antifragile or fluid, the "narrow target" analogy fails because the arrow can be steered mid-flight, corrected, and re-aimed for eons. The paper treats the future as a ballistic trajectory determined by early conditions (path dependence), but intelligence is precisely the power to overcome path dependence. If there is no permanent lock-in, the requirement for *early* convergence relaxes significantly, as society can "stumble" into goodness later through trial and error.
