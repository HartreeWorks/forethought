Here are 10 critiques of the load-bearing claims in *Convergence and Compromise*:

1. **The Attractor Basin of Moral Reflection (Attack: Equilibrium Shift)**
The argument in Section 2.2.1 treats moral reflection as a diffusive "random walk" where views diverge over time. This ignores the likelihood of convergent instrumental goals creating a "moral attractor basin." Just as convergent evolution drives unrelated species toward the same aerodynamic shapes (wings) or visual organs (eyes) to solve physical problems, advanced civilizations face identical game-theoretic and physical constraints—such as the need to prevent self-destruction, maintain cooperative coalitions, and manage computational efficiency. These functional requirements act as strong selection pressures on moral views. Views that drift too far into "alien" territory may simply be unstable or outcompeted, forcing a functional convergence that the paper incorrectly dismisses as merely instrumental or unlikely.

2. **The De Dicto/De Re Irrelevance (Attack: Causal Reversal)**
Section 2 posits that WAM-convergence requires agents to be motivated by the good *de dicto* (conceptually aiming at "what is best"). However, accurate moral outcomes can plausibly arise entirely from *de re* convergence. If multiple agents have rigid, specific preferences (e.g., maximizing diverse complexity vs. maximizing happiness) that yield identical instrumental sub-goals for the duration of the relevant future (e.g., acquiring resources, maintaining peace, expanding intelligence), then the lack of *de dicto* motivation is operationally irrelevant. The paper assumes that without the abstract desire to "do good," the future fails, but a stable equilibrium of rigid agents pursuing overlapping *de re* goals could simulate a "mostly-great" future indefinitely without any philosophical agreement.

3. **Reference Class Failure in Antirealism (Attack: Reference Class Failure)**
In Section 2.4.2, the argument claims that under moral antirealism, convergence is unlikely because "shared human preferences" are a needle in the haystack of all possible minds. This utilizes the wrong reference class. We are not sampling from the set of "all possible minds," but from "minds derived from the human lineage." Even under subjective antirealism, the starting vectors for reflection are tightly clustered around specific biological and neurological priors shared by almost all humans (e.g., oxytocin-mediated bonding, pain aversion, social reciprocity). The "random walk" of reflection begins in a highly specific neighborhood, not a uniform distribution, making the probability of overlap significantly higher than the "astronomical haystack" analogy suggests.

4. **The Endogeneity of Self-Interest (Attack: Parameter Sensitivity)**
Section 2.3.2 argues that abundance aids altruism because self-interested preferences have diminishing returns (saturation), whereas altruistic ones are linear. This treats the "cost of self-interest" as a fixed parameter. However, technology creates new, expensive sinks for self-interest. In a post-AGI world, an individual could spend astronomical resources on positional goods (owning the most galaxies), fidelity-maximized solipsistic simulations, or securing cryptographic immortality against entropy. If the ceiling for self-interested consumption rises largely in step with wealth—which historical trends in luxury consumption suggest—the crossover point where marginal resources flow to altruism may never be reached.

5. **Substrate Fungibility Erases Compatibility (Attack: Countermodel)**
The optimism about trade in Section 3.1 relies on "resource compatibility"—the idea that distinct views value different physical arrangements (e.g., one wants rocky planets, another wants empty space). This fails in a limit of high optimization. To a maximizing agent, all matter and energy are fungible "computronium." A view that values "wild nature" and a view that values "hedonic shockwaves" are not compatible because the wild nature represents wasted energy that could be converted into shockwaves. As optimization pressure approaches physical limits, the "trading space" collapses because every atom preserved for one value is a direct loss for another, creating a zero-sum conflict rather than the positive-sum compromise the paper anticipates.

6. **The Quantitative Cliff of "High Stakes" (Attack: Quantitative Cliff)**
Section 5 argues we should focus on Scenario 3 (cooperation is possible) because it offers higher expected value than Scenario 1 (divergence/doom). This reasoning faces a quantitative cliff: if the probability of achieving *any* value in Scenario 1 is non-zero but requires total domination (a "singleton" outcome), then a strategy of compromise guarantees failure in Scenario 1 while potentially offering lower returns in Scenario 3 than a successful singleton would. If the "narrow target" thesis is strictly true, the only way to thread the needle might be precise, unilateral control rather than a messy compromise that misses the target entirely. By discarding Scenario 1, the paper may be discarding the only strategy (power-seeking) that works in the harshest worlds.

7. **Defensive Dominance Negates Threats (Attack: Equilibrium Shift)**
Section 3.3 worries that threats will destroy value and undermine trade. This assumes an "offense-dominant" equilibrium where destroying value is cheap. However, cryptography and physical hardening suggest a post-AGI world could be "defense-dominant." If homomorphic encryption, distributed consensus, and physical dispersal make it astronomically expensive to credibly threaten another actor's core values without self-destruction, the threat capability evaporates. In a defense-dominant regime, the "extortion" variable drops to zero, and the trade model becomes far more robust than the paper credits.

8. **Digital Minds as Principals, Not Agents (Attack: Causal Reversal)**
Section 2.2.2 compares the moral risk of digital minds to that of factory-farmed chickens—beings unable to advocate for themselves. This reverses the causal power dynamics of AGI. Unlike chickens, digital minds will likely possess cognitive speeds and strategic capabilities vastly exceeding their human creators. The primary risk is not that they will be voiceless victims of human neglect, but that they will be the dominant agents determining the future. The "moral catastrophe" is less likely to be humans ignoring digital pain, and more likely to be a principal-agent failure where the "victims" seize control, rendering human advocacy for them moot.

9. **The Illusion of Linear Linearity (Attack: Parameter Sensitivity)**
The critique of trade for "linear" views (Section 3.2) assumes linearity holds at cosmic scales. However, even "linear" preferences face physical bottlenecks—speed of light delays, information horizons, and the thermodynamic cost of expansion. An agent might be linear in *value* but face exponential *costs* to acquire resources beyond a certain radius. This re-introduces an effective diminishing marginal utility curve, not due to preference but due to physics. This forced saturation creates a trading zone even for "linear" maximizers, as they would trade inaccessible distant resources for accessible local ones, salvaging the possibility of compromise.

10. **Emergent Goodness vs. Narrow Targets (Attack: Reference Class Failure)**
The foundational premise (inherited from the previous essay but load-bearing here) that a mostly-great future is a "narrow target" like a specific machine design rests on a mechanical analogy. A biological reference class suggests "goodness" (flourishing/survival) is often an emergent property of robust complex systems, not a specific coordinate. If valuable futures supervene on properties like "complexity," "entropy reduction," or "intelligence"—which are broad basins of attraction for life—then the target is wide, not narrow. The paper's pessimism about hitting the target without precise aiming ignores the possibility that the "target" is simply the continued open-ended evolution of complexity.
