[The Second-Order Catastrophist]
The paper’s proposal to rely on "compromise" and trade (Section 3) generates a catastrophic hazard: the commodification of suffering. By establishing a market rate for "preventing bad outcomes," the paper advocates for a system that incentivizes the creation of "suffering assets." If I know that a specific group values the non-existence of digital suffering, I am economically incentivized to create potential digital hells to sell the "key" to their destruction. Institutionalizing moral trade doesn't just solve conflict; it creates a liquid market for moral atrocities, likely increasing the total amount of threatened suffering in the universe far beyond what would exist in a non-cooperative "grabby" scenario.
