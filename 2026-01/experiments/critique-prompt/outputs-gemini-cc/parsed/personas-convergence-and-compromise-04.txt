The optimism regarding "moral trade" in Section 3 totally fails to account for the dominance of extortion strategies in high-stakes, asymmetric games. The paper acknowledges threats in passing but underestimates the structural advantage of destruction over creation. It is infinitely cheaper to threaten to simulate a hell-world than it is to build a utopia. If moral trade is normalized, it creates a massive incentive gradient for actors to develop "basilisk" capabilities—credible threats of immense disutility—solely to extract resources from altruistic agents. The equilibrium isn't a compromise; it's a universe where altruists are bled dry by blackmailers until they have zero resources left to pursue the "good."
