"The Instrumentality of Intrinsic Goods"
The paper argues in Section 4.2 that "instrumental goods" (like knowledge or complexity) aren't enough to secure a mostly-great future because they are merely means to an end. This creates a false dichotomy. In a post-AGI context, "instrumental convergence" suggests that almost *any* agent will maximize attributes like intelligence, resource acquisition, and freedom of action. If "flourishing" is defined broadly, these instrumental drives look identical to intrinsic goods for vast stretches of time. A civilization maximizing strictly instrumental control over its environment will look indistinguishable from one valuing "engineering feats" or "life proliferation" for billions of years. The paper undercounts how much of "eutopia" is actually just the successful execution of instrumental sub-goals, meaning "blind" self-interest gets us much closer to the target than the author admits.
