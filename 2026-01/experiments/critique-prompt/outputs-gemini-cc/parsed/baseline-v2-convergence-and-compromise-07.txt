"Ambiguity of the 'Mostly-Great' Threshold" — The paper relies heavily on the "No Easy Eutopia" premise, implying that the target for a good future is extremely narrow. However, the definition of a "mostly-great" future is ambiguous and seemingly perfectionist; if "mostly-great" requires hitting 99% of the theoretical maximum utility (e.g., Total Utilitarianism), the argument is tautologically pessimistic. If the threshold is relaxed to "a future free of suffering with vast flourishing," the target becomes significantly broader (or "clumpier"). By not defining the tolerance range for this target, the paper may be treating a "very good future" as a failure simply because it is not the "optimal" future, thereby exaggerating the difficulty of the task.
