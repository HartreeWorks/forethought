"The De Dicto / De Re Trap"
The paper places immense weight on the distinction between desiring the good *de dicto* (aiming at "what is best") vs. *de re* (aiming at specific things like "happiness"). The author argues that without *de dicto* motivation, we miss the narrow target. This sets the bar for success impossibly high, effectively defining "success" in a way that excludes robust "overlapping consensus." In reality, successful coordination rarely requires agreement on abstract principles; it requires agreement on low-level outcomes. If 99% of "mostly-great" futures look like "nobody is in agony and people are happy," it does not matter if agents pursue this for divergent *de re* reasons. By demanding *de dicto* convergence, the author turns a practical engineering problem (outcome coordination) into a philosophical purity test, creating a pessimist conclusion by definition rather than evidence.
