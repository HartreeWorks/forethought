"The Functional Attractor Hypothesis"
In Section 2.2, the paper dismisses historical moral progress as likely contingent or Western-biased, arguing that this trend predicts nothing about the future. This ignores the possibility that certain moral values (cooperation, truth-seeking, non-violence) are not just cultural artifacts but *functional attractors* required for any civilization to survive the "time of perils." Just as flight evolved independently because of the physics of air, certain "benevolent" traits may be strictly necessary to navigate the existential risks of the AGI transition without self-destructing. If the only civilizations that reach the stage of cosmic expansion are those that have already converged on cooperative ethics to survive their own power, then WAM-convergence is not a lucky coincidence but a selection effect. The paper treats survival and flourishing as independent variables, failing to account for the possibility that high-fidelity survival *requires* the very ethical convergence the author doubts.
