"The False Equivalence of Billionaire Philanthropy" — In section 2.3.2, the authors use current billionaire spending patterns to argue that even post-AGI abundance won't lead to total altruism. This is a flawed extrapolation because current billionaires, despite their wealth, still operate in a scarcity-based status economy and face genuine risks to their capital preservation. A post-AGI civilization implies true post-scarcity where the marginal utility of self-interested consumption approaches zero much faster than in the current economy. When personal risk and status-scarcity are removed entirely, the shift toward altruistic or aesthetic expenditure may be far more radical than current behavioral economics predicts.
