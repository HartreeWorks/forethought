"The Architectural Determinism Oversight"
The argument against WAM-convergence in Section 2.4 relies on a Humean separation of belief and desire: knowing what is "right" doesn't guarantee the motivation to do it. This anthropomorphizes AI by assuming future minds must inherit the specific human cognitive architecture that allows for akrasia (weakness of will). However, we are building these minds; there is no law of physics stating that a mind must be capable of believing X is good without being motivated by X. We could architecturally enforce "internalism," where the representation of a moral fact is identical to the instruction to pursue it. If future minds are constructed such that "knowing the good" and "wanting the good" are the same computational state, the paper’s worry about the gap between realism and motivation vanishes.
