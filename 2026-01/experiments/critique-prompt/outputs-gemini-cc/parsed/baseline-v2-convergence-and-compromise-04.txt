"Inconsistency Regarding Coordination Technologies" — There is a tension between section 3.1, which is optimistic about "iron-clad contracts" facilitating trade, and section 3.3, which fears "value-destroying threats." If superintelligence enables enforceable contracts that solve trust problems for trade, it should theoretically provide equally robust mechanisms for collective security and non-aggression pacts that neutralize the threat of extortion. The paper assumes technology solves the transaction costs of compromise but fails to solve the security dilemma of threats, without explaining why the defensive capabilities of superintelligence wouldn't scale alongside offensive ones to enforce a "mutually assured stability."
