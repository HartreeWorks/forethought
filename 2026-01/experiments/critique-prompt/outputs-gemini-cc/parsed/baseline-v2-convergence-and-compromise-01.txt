"The Fallacy of the Random Walk" — This critique challenges the argument in section 2.2.1 that moral reflection behaves like a "random walk" leading to divergence. The authors assume that reflection causes views to drift apart randomly from a shared origin, but they neglect the possibility that moral reasoning, like mathematical or logical reasoning, has strong attractors. If there are rational constraints on ethical consistency (e.g., transitivity of preferences, impartiality), increased reflection should reduce variance and lead to convergence, not divergence. By treating moral changes as stochastic drift rather than rational discovery, the paper unfairly discounts the potential for 'convergence to the truth' or convergence to a 'reflective equilibrium' shared by sufficiently intelligent agents.
