"The Dissolution of the Trader"
The paper’s optimism about trade (Section 3) relies on the persistence of distinct, stable "owners" or "groups" that can bargain over the future. However, this projects current human individuation onto a post-AGI substrate where the boundaries between agents are likely to dissolve. In a world of digital minds, copyable intelligences, and mergeable utility functions, the concept of "Alice trading with Bob" becomes obsolete; Alice can simply copy herself, absorb Bob, or self-modify to remove the conflict. If the technology required to enable cosmic-scale trade also enables the dissolution of the individual, then "trade" is not the likely mechanism for conflict resolution—imposition or assimilation is. The paper needs to explain why distinct, coherent agents would persist long enough to trade rather than collapsing into a singleton or a fluid, non-transactional soup.
