"Neglect of Biological Shared Priors" — In section 2.4.2, the paper argues that under moral anti-realism, subjective idealization processes will likely diverge because of "free parameters." This ignores the immense, shared biological and evolutionary "prior" that all humans (and potentially human-derived AIs) possess. We are not starting from random coordinates in value-space; we share deep architectural similarities regarding pain, social bonding, status, and curiosity. These shared biological constraints mean that even subjective idealization processes are likely to remain tightly clustered around a set of "human-compatible" values, rather than scattering into an infinite space of alien preferences.
