**Defensive Dominance Negates Threats (Attack: Equilibrium Shift)**
Section 3.3 worries that threats will destroy value and undermine trade. This assumes an "offense-dominant" equilibrium where destroying value is cheap. However, cryptography and physical hardening suggest a post-AGI world could be "defense-dominant." If homomorphic encryption, distributed consensus, and physical dispersal make it astronomically expensive to credibly threaten another actor's core values without self-destruction, the threat capability evaporates. In a defense-dominant regime, the "extortion" variable drops to zero, and the trade model becomes far more robust than the paper credits.
