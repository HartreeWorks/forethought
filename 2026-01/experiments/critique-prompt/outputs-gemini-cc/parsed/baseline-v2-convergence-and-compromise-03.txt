"The De Dicto Motivation Trap" — The paper places excessive weight on the necessity of motivation to promote the good "de dicto" (conceptually), rather than "de re" (the thing itself), particularly in section 2. The argument implies that unless agents explicitly aim for "The Good" as an abstract concept, they will fail to achieve a great future. However, a society where individuals strongly value specific goods *de re*—such as kindness, truth, and lack of suffering—can structurally achieve a "mostly-great" future without a meta-ethical commitment to an abstract definition of goodness. By demanding this high-level philosophical motivation, the paper sets an artificially high bar for what counts as a "safe" trajectory.
