"Underestimation of Institutional Alignment" — In section 4.1, the paper dismisses the idea that self-interest can lead to a good future, critiquing the "invisible hand" analogy. This critique neglects the potential for advanced mechanism design and institutional engineering to align self-interest with global welfare more perfectly than current markets do. We do not rely on the "benevolence of the baker" today, but on the market structure; similarly, a superintelligent civilization could design allocation mechanisms where the only way for an agent to maximize their own utility is to contribute to the aggregate good. The failure of self-interest today is a failure of mechanism design, which is a solvable technical problem, not an intrinsic moral gap.
