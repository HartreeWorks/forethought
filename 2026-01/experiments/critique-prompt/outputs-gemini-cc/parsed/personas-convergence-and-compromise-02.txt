The reliance on "iron-clad contracts" in Section 3.1 to salvage the possibility of moral trade is essentially magical thinking disguised as policy. The paper asserts that superintelligence could solve trust problems without specifying the verification mechanisms required to enforce agreements across cosmic distances or between entities with opaque cognitive architectures. Unless the authors can formally specify a trustless protocol that prevents a superintelligence from defecting once it has secured the traded resources—specifically how a "lock-in" is mathematically guaranteed against an adversary with superior decrypting or hacking capabilities—the entire section on trade collapses into wishful thinking. "If it isn't code, it isn't real," and this paper offers no code for how a utilitarian compels a paperclipper to keep its word.
