"The Ephemeral Lock-in"
The entire "aiming" metaphor presumes that there is a specific moment of "lock-in" where the trajectory is set forever (Section 2.5). However, if the future involves superintelligent entities capable of self-editing, values may never lock in; they may remain fluid, subject to drift, drift, and re-negotiation indefinitely. If values are antifragile or fluid, the "narrow target" analogy fails because the arrow can be steered mid-flight, corrected, and re-aimed for eons. The paper treats the future as a ballistic trajectory determined by early conditions (path dependence), but intelligence is precisely the power to overcome path dependence. If there is no permanent lock-in, the requirement for *early* convergence relaxes significantly, as society can "stumble" into goodness later through trial and error.
