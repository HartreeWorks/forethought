"The Paradox of Leverage"
In Section 5, the paper argues we should act on the assumption of Scenario 3 (convergence is possible) because that is where we have leverage. This reasoning is vulnerable to a "fanaticism" objection: it encourages optimizing for a potentially negligible slice of probability space at the expense of robust strategies. If Scenario 1 (no convergence) is overwhelmingly likely, acting as if Scenario 3 is true might actively harm the outcome in Scenario 1—for example, by empowering a centralizing force (hoping it converges) that ultimately becomes a permanent totalitarian lock-in (when it doesn't). The paper needs to show that strategies for Scenario 3 are "safe fails" for Scenario 1, otherwise, the normative boomerang effect applies: the advice to "aim for the narrow target" might cause us to miss the broad, "okay" targets that were actually achievable.
