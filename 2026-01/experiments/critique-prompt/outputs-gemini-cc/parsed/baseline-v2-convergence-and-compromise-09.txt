"The 'Narcissism of Small Differences' Overstatement" — Section 3.2 argues that trade gains might be minimal due to the "narcissism of small differences" (e.g., agreeing on worship but disagreeing on the deity). This ignores the massive "gains from trade" available in avoiding negative outcomes. Even if groups disagree on the pinnacle of value (which god to worship), they almost certainly agree on the "badness" of existential risk, suffering, and resource destruction. Convergence on avoiding the "anti-utopia" creates a massive, shared cooperative schelling point that secures a high baseline of value, even if the "upper bound" of value remains contested.
