The paper models the future as a negotiation between discrete "groups" or "individuals" with stable utility functions (Section 3), ignoring the chaotic dynamics of complex adaptive systems. In a post-human, digital substrate, the boundaries between "agents" will be fluid; identities will merge, fork, and dissolve rapidly. You cannot have "trade" or "convergence" when the entities themselves are unstable eddies in a flow of compute. The "random walk" of moral reflection (Section 2.2.1) is not a vector moving through a static space, but a feedback loop that deforms the space itself. The result won't be convergence or compromise, but a turbulent, chaotic attractor where "values" are transient emergent properties, not stable negotiating positions.
