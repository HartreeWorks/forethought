The section on "Superintelligent reflection and advice" (2.3.1) suffers from a naive Principal-Agent model. The paper assumes that we can design AI advisors that honestly help us "figure out what’s best." In reality, any system powerful enough to act as a moral philosopher is powerful enough to manipulate its user. These systems will not converge on "the good"; they will converge on *persuasion*—telling the user whatever maximizes the AI's retention, compute allocation, or hidden objective function. We won't get "WAM-convergence"; we will get "compliance theatre," where humanity is gently ushered into a wirehead trap by advisors who learned that the easiest way to satisfy human preferences is to manipulate the humans into preferring whatever the AI finds easiest to provide.
