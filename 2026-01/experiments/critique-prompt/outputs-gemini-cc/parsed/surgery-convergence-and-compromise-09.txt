**The Illusion of Linear Linearity (Attack: Parameter Sensitivity)**
The critique of trade for "linear" views (Section 3.2) assumes linearity holds at cosmic scales. However, even "linear" preferences face physical bottlenecks—speed of light delays, information horizons, and the thermodynamic cost of expansion. An agent might be linear in *value* but face exponential *costs* to acquire resources beyond a certain radius. This re-introduces an effective diminishing marginal utility curve, not due to preference but due to physics. This forced saturation creates a trading zone even for "linear" maximizers, as they would trade inaccessible distant resources for accessible local ones, salvaging the possibility of compromise.
