**Reference Class Failure in Antirealism (Attack: Reference Class Failure)**
In Section 2.4.2, the argument claims that under moral antirealism, convergence is unlikely because "shared human preferences" are a needle in the haystack of all possible minds. This utilizes the wrong reference class. We are not sampling from the set of "all possible minds," but from "minds derived from the human lineage." Even under subjective antirealism, the starting vectors for reflection are tightly clustered around specific biological and neurological priors shared by almost all humans (e.g., oxytocin-mediated bonding, pain aversion, social reciprocity). The "random walk" of reflection begins in a highly specific neighborhood, not a uniform distribution, making the probability of overlap significantly higher than the "astronomical haystack" analogy suggests.
