**The Endogeneity of Self-Interest (Attack: Parameter Sensitivity)**
Section 2.3.2 argues that abundance aids altruism because self-interested preferences have diminishing returns (saturation), whereas altruistic ones are linear. This treats the "cost of self-interest" as a fixed parameter. However, technology creates new, expensive sinks for self-interest. In a post-AGI world, an individual could spend astronomical resources on positional goods (owning the most galaxies), fidelity-maximized solipsistic simulations, or securing cryptographic immortality against entropy. If the ceiling for self-interested consumption rises largely in step with wealth—which historical trends in luxury consumption suggest—the crossover point where marginal resources flow to altruism may never be reached.
