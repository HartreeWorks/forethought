**The Quantitative Cliff of "High Stakes" (Attack: Quantitative Cliff)**
Section 5 argues we should focus on Scenario 3 (cooperation is possible) because it offers higher expected value than Scenario 1 (divergence/doom). This reasoning faces a quantitative cliff: if the probability of achieving *any* value in Scenario 1 is non-zero but requires total domination (a "singleton" outcome), then a strategy of compromise guarantees failure in Scenario 1 while potentially offering lower returns in Scenario 3 than a successful singleton would. If the "narrow target" thesis is strictly true, the only way to thread the needle might be precise, unilateral control rather than a messy compromise that misses the target entirely. By discarding Scenario 1, the paper may be discarding the only strategy (power-seeking) that works in the harshest worlds.
