> Advanced civilisations face identical game-theoretic constraints—like avoiding self-destruction and maintaining cooperation—that act as selection pressures funnelling moral views toward functional convergence, much like convergent evolution produces wings independently.

**The Attractor Basin of Moral Reflection (Attack: Equilibrium Shift)**
The argument in Section 2.2.1 treats moral reflection as a diffusive "random walk" where views diverge over time. This ignores the likelihood of convergent instrumental goals creating a "moral attractor basin." Just as convergent evolution drives unrelated species toward the same aerodynamic shapes (wings) or visual organs (eyes) to solve physical problems, advanced civilizations face identical game-theoretic and physical constraints—such as the need to prevent self-destruction, maintain cooperative coalitions, and manage computational efficiency. These functional requirements act as strong selection pressures on moral views. Views that drift too far into "alien" territory may simply be unstable or outcompeted, forcing a functional convergence that the paper incorrectly dismisses as merely instrumental or unlikely.
