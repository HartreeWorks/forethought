"Mischaracterization of Moral Realism as 'Alien'" — The argument in section 2.4.1 suggests that if Moral Realism is true, the objective truth is likely "alien" and therefore non-motivational. This relies on a specific, non-naturalist intuition about Realism that divorces value from the nature of the beings holding it. Many robust Realist traditions (such as Aristotelian naturalism or constitutivism) argue that moral facts are grounded in the nature of rational agency or biological flourishing itself. If the "correct" moral view is derived from what constitutes a flourishing agent, then recognizing the truth would inherently align with the agent's motivation, rather than being an external, alien imposition that agents would reject.
