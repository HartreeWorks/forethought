The "Abundance and diminishing returns" argument (Section 2.3.2) is economically illiterate regarding positional goods. The authors assume that once absolute material needs are met, agents will pivot to altruism. This ignores that in a post-AGI context, the most relevant resource is *dominance*—the capacity to ensure one's continued existence and goal-pursuit against rivals. Power is a zero-sum, positional good with constant or increasing marginal utility. Billionaires today don't pivot to 99% altruism because wealth confers status and power; cosmic superintelligences will hoard resources not for consumption, but for defense and hegemony, leaving no surplus for the "altruistic" redistribution the paper hypothesizes.
