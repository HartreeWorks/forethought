"The Narcissism of Large Differences"
The paper suggests that trade works best when views are "resource-compatible" (Section 3.1), assuming that different moral views will want different slices of the pie. This underestimates the "totalizing" nature of many probable ethical systems. A negative utilitarian does not want a corner of the galaxy to reduce suffering; they want *all* matter organized to minimize suffering everywhere. A religious fundamentalist does not want a sanctuary; they want universal conversion. If the dominant moral views are absolutist rather than satisficing, the marginal utility of "owning 50% of the universe" is not 50% of the value—it may be zero or negative (due to the existence of the 'sinful' other half). The paper relies on a hidden assumption that future values will be essentially liberal-pluralist, willing to tolerate the existence of "bad" value systems in exchange for their own territory.
