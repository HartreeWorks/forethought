**The De Dicto/De Re Irrelevance (Attack: Causal Reversal)**
Section 2 posits that WAM-convergence requires agents to be motivated by the good *de dicto* (conceptually aiming at "what is best"). However, accurate moral outcomes can plausibly arise entirely from *de re* convergence. If multiple agents have rigid, specific preferences (e.g., maximizing diverse complexity vs. maximizing happiness) that yield identical instrumental sub-goals for the duration of the relevant future (e.g., acquiring resources, maintaining peace, expanding intelligence), then the lack of *de dicto* motivation is operationally irrelevant. The paper assumes that without the abstract desire to "do good," the future fails, but a stable equilibrium of rigid agents pursuing overlapping *de re* goals could simulate a "mostly-great" future indefinitely without any philosophical agreement.
