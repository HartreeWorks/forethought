[The Capability Accelerationist]
The entire premise of "aiming" (Section 4) assumes that the timescale of reflection allows for course correction, which ignores the primacy of speed in recursive self-improvement scenarios. The future belongs to the first maximize-able process that seizes the lightcone, regardless of its "aim." Safety measures, moral reflection, or attempts to "hone in" on a narrow target necessarily incur a compute penalty. Therefore, the agents most likely to determine the future are those that discard "aiming" in favor of raw acceleration. The paper’s "sailing" analogy fails because it assumes the island sits still; in reality, the ocean is being converted into paperclips while the captain checks the compass.
