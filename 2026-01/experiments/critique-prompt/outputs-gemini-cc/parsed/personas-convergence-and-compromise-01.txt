[The Evolutionary Skeptic]
The paper’s central metaphor of "honing in" on a target via reflection (Section 2) fundamentally misunderstands the selection pressures operative during an intelligence explosion. The authors treat moral values as static inputs that can be refined, ignoring that the *holders* of these values are subject to intense Darwinian competition. In a post-AGI environment, agents that pause to engage in the "random walk" of moral reflection or prioritize "goodness de dicto" will be out-competed by agents optimized for rapid replication, resource acquisition, and belligerence. The "narrow target" of a mostly-great future isn't missed because of poor navigation; it is missed because the specific trait of "caring about the abstract good" is maladaptive against a backdrop of ruthlessly expanding, non-reflective power-maximizers.
