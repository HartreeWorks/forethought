The discussion in Section 2.4 regarding moral realism vs. anti-realism is a category error that substitutes metaphysical speculation for causal modeling. Whether moral facts "exist" independently of minds is empirically irrelevant to the behavior of physical systems (brains or GPUs). The only thing that matters is the causal mechanism of objective function generalization in neural networks. The paper provides no empirical evidence or falsifiable model for how "valuing the good de dicto" would emerge from training data distributions or reward functions. Without a mechanistic account of how an optimization process generalizes to "morality" rather than "reward hacking," the speculation on convergence is essentially theology, not science.
