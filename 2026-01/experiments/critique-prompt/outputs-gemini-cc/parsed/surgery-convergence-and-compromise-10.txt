> The "narrow target" metaphor for a good future may be misleading—biology suggests flourishing emerges naturally from complex adaptive systems rather than requiring precise aim at a specific outcome.

**Emergent Goodness vs. Narrow Targets (Attack: Reference Class Failure)**
The foundational premise (inherited from the previous essay but load-bearing here) that a mostly-great future is a "narrow target" like a specific machine design rests on a mechanical analogy. A biological reference class suggests "goodness" (flourishing/survival) is often an emergent property of robust complex systems, not a specific coordinate. If valuable futures supervene on properties like "complexity," "entropy reduction," or "intelligence"—which are broad basins of attraction for life—then the target is wide, not narrow. The paper's pessimism about hitting the target without precise aiming ignores the possibility that the "target" is simply the continued open-ended evolution of complexity.
