"The Ontological Incompatibility of Moral Trade"
The paper argues that even if ethical views diverge (antirealism), a mostly-great future can be achieved through "moral trade," where different value systems swap resources to maximize their respective goals. This inference fails because it assumes that divergent moral ontologies will remain sufficiently compatible to define "resources" and "trade" in mutually intelligible ways. If antirealism is true to the degree the paper fears, distinct moral intelligences may not merely disagree on what is *good*, but on the fundamental metaphysics of what constitutes a "transaction," an "agent," or a "unit of value." A deep ecologist AI and a hedonistic utilitarian AI may lack the shared substrate to execute a trade, as the former views the commodification of nature required for the trade as an intrinsic harm, while the latter views the ecologist’s refusal to optimize matter as a waste. If values diverge radically, the transaction costs of establishing a shared trading protocol may approach infinity, rendering the "compromise" solution impossible.
