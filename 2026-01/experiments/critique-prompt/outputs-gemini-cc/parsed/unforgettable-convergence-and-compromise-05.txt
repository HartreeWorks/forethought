"The Dark Forest of Moral Trade"
The paper acknowledges threats (Section 3.3) but treats them as a tax on value that might be managed; it fails to recognize that the *possibility* of threats might preclude the initial expansion required for the "sailing" analogy. If the author is correct that "bads weigh heavily" and extortion is easier than production, the equilibrium strategy for a rational civilization is not to sail for the island (expansion) but to hide or preemptively destroy potential traders to avoid infinite negative utility. The "trade" scenario assumes a backdrop of secure property rights and non-aggression that usually requires a leviathan to enforce—the very "global dictatorship" the paper earlier critiques. Without a prior explanation of how defense dominates offense in this future, the existence of divergent values suggests a Hobbesian war of all against all, not a marketplace.
