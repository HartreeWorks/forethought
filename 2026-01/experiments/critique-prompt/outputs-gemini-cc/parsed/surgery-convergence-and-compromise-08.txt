**Digital Minds as Principals, Not Agents (Attack: Causal Reversal)**
Section 2.2.2 compares the moral risk of digital minds to that of factory-farmed chickens—beings unable to advocate for themselves. This reverses the causal power dynamics of AGI. Unlike chickens, digital minds will likely possess cognitive speeds and strategic capabilities vastly exceeding their human creators. The primary risk is not that they will be voiceless victims of human neglect, but that they will be the dominant agents determining the future. The "moral catastrophe" is less likely to be humans ignoring digital pain, and more likely to be a principal-agent failure where the "victims" seize control, rendering human advocacy for them moot.
