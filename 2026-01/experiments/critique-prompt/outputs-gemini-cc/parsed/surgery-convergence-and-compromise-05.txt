**Substrate Fungibility Erases Compatibility (Attack: Countermodel)**
The optimism about trade in Section 3.1 relies on "resource compatibility"—the idea that distinct views value different physical arrangements (e.g., one wants rocky planets, another wants empty space). This fails in a limit of high optimization. To a maximizing agent, all matter and energy are fungible "computronium." A view that values "wild nature" and a view that values "hedonic shockwaves" are not compatible because the wild nature represents wasted energy that could be converted into shockwaves. As optimization pressure approaches physical limits, the "trading space" collapses because every atom preserved for one value is a direct loss for another, creating a zero-sum conflict rather than the positive-sum compromise the paper anticipates.
