1. "The Fallacy of the Random Walk" — This critique challenges the argument in section 2.2.1 that moral reflection behaves like a "random walk" leading to divergence. The authors assume that reflection causes views to drift apart randomly from a shared origin, but they neglect the possibility that moral reasoning, like mathematical or logical reasoning, has strong attractors. If there are rational constraints on ethical consistency (e.g., transitivity of preferences, impartiality), increased reflection should reduce variance and lead to convergence, not divergence. By treating moral changes as stochastic drift rather than rational discovery, the paper unfairly discounts the potential for 'convergence to the truth' or convergence to a 'reflective equilibrium' shared by sufficiently intelligent agents.

2. "Neglect of Biological Shared Priors" — In section 2.4.2, the paper argues that under moral anti-realism, subjective idealization processes will likely diverge because of "free parameters." This ignores the immense, shared biological and evolutionary "prior" that all humans (and potentially human-derived AIs) possess. We are not starting from random coordinates in value-space; we share deep architectural similarities regarding pain, social bonding, status, and curiosity. These shared biological constraints mean that even subjective idealization processes are likely to remain tightly clustered around a set of "human-compatible" values, rather than scattering into an infinite space of alien preferences.

3. "The De Dicto Motivation Trap" — The paper places excessive weight on the necessity of motivation to promote the good "de dicto" (conceptually), rather than "de re" (the thing itself), particularly in section 2. The argument implies that unless agents explicitly aim for "The Good" as an abstract concept, they will fail to achieve a great future. However, a society where individuals strongly value specific goods *de re*—such as kindness, truth, and lack of suffering—can structurally achieve a "mostly-great" future without a meta-ethical commitment to an abstract definition of goodness. By demanding this high-level philosophical motivation, the paper sets an artificially high bar for what counts as a "safe" trajectory.

4. "Inconsistency Regarding Coordination Technologies" — There is a tension between section 3.1, which is optimistic about "iron-clad contracts" facilitating trade, and section 3.3, which fears "value-destroying threats." If superintelligence enables enforceable contracts that solve trust problems for trade, it should theoretically provide equally robust mechanisms for collective security and non-aggression pacts that neutralize the threat of extortion. The paper assumes technology solves the transaction costs of compromise but fails to solve the security dilemma of threats, without explaining why the defensive capabilities of superintelligence wouldn't scale alongside offensive ones to enforce a "mutually assured stability."

5. "The False Equivalence of Billionaire Philanthropy" — In section 2.3.2, the authors use current billionaire spending patterns to argue that even post-AGI abundance won't lead to total altruism. This is a flawed extrapolation because current billionaires, despite their wealth, still operate in a scarcity-based status economy and face genuine risks to their capital preservation. A post-AGI civilization implies true post-scarcity where the marginal utility of self-interested consumption approaches zero much faster than in the current economy. When personal risk and status-scarcity are removed entirely, the shift toward altruistic or aesthetic expenditure may be far more radical than current behavioral economics predicts.

6. "Mischaracterization of Moral Realism as 'Alien'" — The argument in section 2.4.1 suggests that if Moral Realism is true, the objective truth is likely "alien" and therefore non-motivational. This relies on a specific, non-naturalist intuition about Realism that divorces value from the nature of the beings holding it. Many robust Realist traditions (such as Aristotelian naturalism or constitutivism) argue that moral facts are grounded in the nature of rational agency or biological flourishing itself. If the "correct" moral view is derived from what constitutes a flourishing agent, then recognizing the truth would inherently align with the agent's motivation, rather than being an external, alien imposition that agents would reject.

7. "Ambiguity of the 'Mostly-Great' Threshold" — The paper relies heavily on the "No Easy Eutopia" premise, implying that the target for a good future is extremely narrow. However, the definition of a "mostly-great" future is ambiguous and seemingly perfectionist; if "mostly-great" requires hitting 99% of the theoretical maximum utility (e.g., Total Utilitarianism), the argument is tautologically pessimistic. If the threshold is relaxed to "a future free of suffering with vast flourishing," the target becomes significantly broader (or "clumpier"). By not defining the tolerance range for this target, the paper may be treating a "very good future" as a failure simply because it is not the "optimal" future, thereby exaggerating the difficulty of the task.

8. "Underestimation of Institutional Alignment" — In section 4.1, the paper dismisses the idea that self-interest can lead to a good future, critiquing the "invisible hand" analogy. This critique neglects the potential for advanced mechanism design and institutional engineering to align self-interest with global welfare more perfectly than current markets do. We do not rely on the "benevolence of the baker" today, but on the market structure; similarly, a superintelligent civilization could design allocation mechanisms where the only way for an agent to maximize their own utility is to contribute to the aggregate good. The failure of self-interest today is a failure of mechanism design, which is a solvable technical problem, not an intrinsic moral gap.

9. "The 'Narcissism of Small Differences' Overstatement" — Section 3.2 argues that trade gains might be minimal due to the "narcissism of small differences" (e.g., agreeing on worship but disagreeing on the deity). This ignores the massive "gains from trade" available in avoiding negative outcomes. Even if groups disagree on the pinnacle of value (which god to worship), they almost certainly agree on the "badness" of existential risk, suffering, and resource destruction. Convergence on avoiding the "anti-utopia" creates a massive, shared cooperative schelling point that secures a high baseline of value, even if the "upper bound" of value remains contested.

10. "Contradiction in Instrumental Convergence" — In section 4.2, the authors argue that "instrumentally valuable" goods (like knowledge or complexity) are insufficient to ensure a mostly-great future because they are merely means to an end. This conflicts with the concept of "instrumental convergence" in AI safety, which suggests that almost any final goal requires a standardized set of intermediate resources (peace, truth-seeking, cognitive enhancement). If 90% of the trajectory involves building these universally good instrumental structures, the "future" (as defined by the infrastructure and state of the world for eons) will look indistinguishable from a "good" future for the vast majority of time, regardless of the divergent final goals.
