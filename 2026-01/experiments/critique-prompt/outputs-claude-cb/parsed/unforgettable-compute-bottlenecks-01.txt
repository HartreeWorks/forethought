"The Reconfiguration Paradox": The paper argues that short-run estimates of ρ showing strong complementarity don't apply because AGIs could quickly "reconfigure AI R&D to make good use of abundant cognitive labor," citing Jones (2003) on how production processes adapt over time. But this creates a paradox: if reconfiguration is itself a cognitive task that AGIs can accelerate, then the paper is assuming the conclusion—that cognitive labor can substitute for compute—in order to prove that cognitive labor can substitute for compute. The reconfiguration hypothesis requires that the meta-task of finding new production processes is not compute-bottlenecked, but there's no reason to grant this special exemption. If finding better algorithms requires experiments, then finding better ways to organize research also plausibly requires experiments. If this objection holds, the paper cannot appeal to rapid reconfiguration without separately establishing that organizational innovation in AI R&D has different complementarity properties than algorithmic innovation.
