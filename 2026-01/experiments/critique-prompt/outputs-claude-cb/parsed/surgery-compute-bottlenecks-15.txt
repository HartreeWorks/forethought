> If the breakthroughs needed for self-improvement are paradigm-gated rather than effort-gated, input substitutability is irrelevant—no amount of cognitive labour overcomes an architectural ceiling the CES model doesn't capture.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The paper's final probability estimate (10-40% chance of SIE despite compute bottlenecks) is anchored on ρ being "likely between -0.2 and 0."

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

Construct a scenario where ρ is indeed -0.1 (within the paper's favored range), yet SIE fails for reasons orthogonal to CES dynamics. Suppose software improvements hit *capability walls* rather than compute walls—certain capabilities (robust reasoning, novel scientific insight, self-improvement) require architectural innovations that cannot be found through any amount of cognitive labor applied to current paradigms. The CES model describes input substitutability, not the existence of output ceilings. A high ρ means cognitive labor can substitute for compute, but says nothing about whether the resulting "progress" includes the specific capabilities needed for recursive self-improvement. If SIE requires capabilities that are paradigm-gated rather than effort-gated, the entire CES framing is orthogonal to the actual bottleneck.
