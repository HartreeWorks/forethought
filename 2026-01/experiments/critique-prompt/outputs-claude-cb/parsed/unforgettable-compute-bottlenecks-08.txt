"The Serial Dependency Blindspot": The paper lists ways cognitive labor could substitute for compute: "running smaller scale experiments, optimising every part of the stack, generating way better ideas, designing way better experiments, stopping experiments early." But these activities have serial dependencies that cognitive labor cannot parallelize away. You cannot "design way better experiments" until you've seen results from previous experiments; you cannot "stop experiments early" without running the early parts; "generating way better ideas" requires feedback on which ideas worked. Even with infinite cognitive labor, the wall-clock time for sequential experiment-feedback loops remains constrained by experiment runtime, which scales with compute. The paper treats cognitive labor as if all research activities are parallelizable, but the information dependencies in empirical research create serial bottlenecks that no amount of parallel cognition can eliminate.
