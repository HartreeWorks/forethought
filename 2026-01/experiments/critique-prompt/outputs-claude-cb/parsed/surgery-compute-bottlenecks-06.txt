> The long-run estimates showing ρ≈0 bundle in decades of physical capital accumulation alongside labour reorganisation, so they can't justify assuming labour alone can substitute for fixed compute in days.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The paper argues that long-run economic estimates showing ρ≈0 should be weighted heavily because "Cobb Douglas is a good model for long-run growth."

**Attack type:**
Reference class failure

The Jones (2003) hypothesis explains long-run ρ≈0 via decades-long industrial reorganization—building new factories, retraining workforces, developing new supply chains. The paper assumes AGIs could accomplish equivalent "reconfiguration" of AI R&D in "days or weeks," but this analogy fails because the long-run economic estimates bundle together not just process optimization but also the *physical capital accumulation* that occurs over decades. When the economy adjusts long-run, K isn't held fixed—it grows alongside the new production processes. The paper is citing evidence for "L and K both grow and reorganize together" to support "L can grow alone and reorganize around fixed K." If this critique holds, the appeal to long-run estimates as supporting ρ≈0 under fixed compute collapses.
