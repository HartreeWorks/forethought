"The Definitional Gerrymandering of 'Software Intelligence Explosion'" — The paper concludes by defining an SIE as ">=5 OOMs of increase in effective training compute in <1 years without needing more hardware" and estimates a 10-40% probability. But this definition appears chosen to be achievable even under moderate compute constraints, rather than capturing what matters about explosive AI development. Five orders of magnitude of effective compute improvement, if stretched over nearly a full year, might not produce the "shoot from human-level to superintelligent AI in a few months" scenario described in the introduction as motivating concern about SIE. The paper's framing shifts between an alarming scenario where "society wouldn't have time to prepare" and a technical definition that could be satisfied by relatively gradual progress. This makes it unclear whether the 10-40% estimate addresses the scenario of genuine concern.
