**[The Cognitive Scientist]** The paper claims that surveyed AI researchers estimate moving from "median employee" to "top employee" researchers would increase progress pace by 6x, treating this as evidence for high cognitive-labor returns. But this estimate is subject to massive anchoring effects, availability bias, and self-serving attribution. Researchers systematically overestimate the contribution of insight versus luck and compute, because insights are memorable and narratively satisfying while "we tried 500 things and one worked" is not. The paper also assumes that "smarter" AGI researchers would produce proportionally more progress, but cognitive science research on expert performance suggests diminishing returns to raw intelligence past threshold competence—domain knowledge, tacit skills, and serendipitous exposure to the right problems matter enormously. The implicit model where "2x smarter = 2x faster progress" has no empirical support in studies of human research productivity.
