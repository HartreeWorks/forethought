"The Strongest Link Fallacy": Counterargument 7 reframes AI R&D as a "strongest link" problem where you only need one non-bottlenecked route to succeed, against the CES model's "weakest link" structure. But this framing is inconsistent with how the paper treats the SIE mechanism. The SIE requires a feedback loop where improvements compound—AI improves algorithms, better algorithms improve AI, etc. For this loop to accelerate, the marginal route to improvement must itself not be bottlenecked. Finding one non-bottlenecked route only helps if that route remains non-bottlenecked as you iterate through the loop multiple times. The paper gives no reason to think that whichever route happens to have favorable ρ at step N will still have favorable ρ at step N+100. The "strongest link" framing might justify one-time gains but cannot justify sustained acceleration without additional assumptions about the durability of that link.
