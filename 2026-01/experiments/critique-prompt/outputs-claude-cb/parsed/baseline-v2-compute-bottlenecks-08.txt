"The Neglected Role of Data as a Third Input" — The CES framework as applied throughout the paper considers only two inputs: cognitive labor (L) and compute (K). However, AI R&D also requires training data, which has its own supply constraints and substitutability relationships. The paper never addresses whether data might constitute an additional bottleneck with its own ρ parameter. If high-quality training data has low substitutability with cognitive labor—plausible given that no amount of researcher intelligence can conjure novel data from nothing—then the two-input CES model fundamentally misspecifies the production function. This omission is particularly significant given recent concerns about training data exhaustion and the increasing difficulty of curating useful datasets.
