"The Manufacturing Disanalogy That Proves Too Much": The paper argues that economic estimates from manufacturing overstate complementarity because manufacturing lacks analogues to "running smaller scale experiments" and "optimizing every part of the stack." But manufacturing has its own substitution mechanisms—process innovation, lean production, automation of inspection—that economists have presumably captured in their ρ estimates. If manufacturing ρ is still -0.4 despite these substitution mechanisms, this suggests that domains generally have lower substitutability than naive lists of "things you could do with more labor" would suggest. The paper assumes AI R&D's substitution mechanisms are qualitatively more powerful than manufacturing's, but provides no evidence for this beyond assertion. The existence of domain-specific substitution mechanisms in manufacturing that still yield low ρ estimates is evidence against, not for, the paper's optimism about AI R&D.
