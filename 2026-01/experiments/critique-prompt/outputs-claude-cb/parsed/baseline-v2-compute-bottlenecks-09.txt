"The Unsubstantiated Claim About Long-Run ρ" — The paper relies heavily on the claim that "longer-run estimates of ρ tend to give higher results" and that "Cobb Douglas is a good model for long-run growth" (implying ρ=0). However, the cited source (Jones 2003) is a single paper with a specific hypothesis, not established consensus. The paper presents this as settled fact while simultaneously arguing that economic estimates are generally unreliable. Moreover, the analogy between long-run economic adjustment (occurring over years or decades) and potential AI-driven reconfiguration (claimed to happen in "days or weeks") is asserted without justification. The mechanisms enabling long-run ρ convergence to zero in traditional economies—institutional adaptation, capital formation, technological diffusion—may have no analogue in rapid AI development.
