**[The Institutional Corruptionist]** The paper's optimistic SIE scenario assumes that AI labs will accurately report their algorithmic efficiency gains and compute usage, but these metrics are unauditable and labs have overwhelming incentives to manipulate them. "Algorithmic efficiency" improvements can be fabricated by cherry-picking benchmarks, adjusting evaluation protocols, or quietly increasing actual compute while claiming otherwise. The paper cites "the past ten years" of algorithmic progress without acknowledging that these efficiency claims come from the same labs competing for investment and talent. When the paper assumes we can measure whether progress is "compute-bottlenecked" or "cognitive-labor-bottlenecked," it presupposes a transparency that doesn't exist. An SIE could appear to be happening on paper while actually being driven by undisclosed compute scaling, and we'd have no way to tell until the bottleneck suddenly materialized.
