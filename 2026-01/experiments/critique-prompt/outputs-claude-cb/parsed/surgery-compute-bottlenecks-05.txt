> Algorithmic efficiency gains act as a force multiplier on *both* cognitive labour and experimental throughput, so treating either input as fixed understates the feedback loop.

Algorithmic efficiency gains allow increasing both inputs (cognitive labor AND effective experiments), undermining the fixed-input assumption

**Dependencies**:
- The thesis depends on (1), which depends on (2), (3), and (4) as supporting arguments
- (5) is presented as an independent defeater of the bottleneck objection
- The "early stages" qualifier depends on the claim that even if -0.2<ρ<0, bottlenecks only bite after ~5 OOMs of progress

**Hidden load**:
- Assumes AI R&D progress can be meaningfully decomposed into separable inputs of "cognitive labor" and "compute"
- Assumes the SIE dynamic involves cognitive labor scaling while compute remains relatively fixed
- Assumes insights from talking to current AI researchers about what superintelligent researchers could do are reliable
- Assumes algorithmic efficiency gains during an SIE would be applicable to the experiments themselves (not just deployed models)
