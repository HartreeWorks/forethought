"The Extrapolation Sword Cuts Both Ways": The paper argues we should distrust economic estimates of ρ because they're measured over ~2× variation in L/K and extrapolating to multiple OOMs is "heroic." But this same reasoning undermines the paper's own positive claims about what happens at high cognitive labor inputs. The author's intuitions about "max speed" being implausibly low below 30× are also extrapolations from current experience—we've never observed what happens when you add even 10× more researchers to AI R&D, let alone trillions of superintelligent ones. The paper selectively applies extrapolation skepticism: dismissing empirical estimates as unreliable for extrapolation while treating armchair intuitions about the "specific things you could do with abundant cognitive labor" as reliable guides to behavior multiple OOMs away. If extrapolation is unreliable, the paper's confidence that ρ lies between -0.2 and 0 is equally unfounded.
