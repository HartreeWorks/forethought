**[The Historical Parallelist]** The paper argues that long-run estimates of ρ trend toward zero because "we invent new production processes that use our new balance of inputs more effectively," citing Jones (2003). But the historical cases where this rebalancing occurred—the Industrial Revolution, electrification, computerization—all involved decades of institutional adaptation, workforce retraining, and infrastructure development. The paper claims AGIs could achieve this reconfiguration "in days or weeks," but historical parallels suggest that the binding constraints on production reorganization are often social and institutional, not purely cognitive. When factories first got electric motors, they initially just replaced steam engines one-for-one; it took 30 years to realize you could redesign factory layouts around distributed power. The AGIs might think fast, but convincing human institutions to reorganize around new production methods has never been a pure speed-of-thought problem. The paper assumes away the actual historical bottleneck.
