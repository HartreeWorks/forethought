"The Implausibility Bootstrap": The paper rejects economic estimates because they imply "max speeds" the author finds "implausibly low" (below 10-30×), and uses this intuition to constrain ρ to between -0.2 and 0. But this methodology is circular: the paper determines plausible max speeds by "thinking through, and talking to AI researchers about, the specific things you could do with abundant cognitive labor." These researchers have never operated with abundant cognitive labor—they're extrapolating from current conditions. The paper is effectively saying "economic estimates must be wrong because my intuitions, formed under compute-scarce conditions, suggest higher substitutability." There's no independent ground truth here; the author's intuitions about what abundant cognitive labor could achieve are exactly what's in question. If this objection holds, the paper needs an independent method for establishing plausible max speeds that doesn't rely on intuitions shaped by the current regime.
