> The fact that frontier labs already optimise across all available scaling routes means today's compute-heavy dominance is evidence the compute-light alternatives have already hit walls.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The paper argues there are "multiple routes to superintelligence" (extrapolation, scaffolding, data flywheels) and we only need one non-bottlenecked route

**Attack type:**
Equilibrium shift

If multiple routes exist with different ρ values, and labs optimize for whichever route has highest ρ, then *current* observed progress already reflects this optimization. The revealed preference of frontier labs—which heavily invest in larger training runs rather than purely scaling researcher headcount—suggests the high-ρ routes have already been exploited or don't scale far. During an SIE, the same optimization would occur, but the fact that compute-intensive approaches dominate today implies the compute-light alternatives hit walls that abundant cognition can't overcome. The "strongest link" framing assumes we haven't already found and exhausted the best links.
