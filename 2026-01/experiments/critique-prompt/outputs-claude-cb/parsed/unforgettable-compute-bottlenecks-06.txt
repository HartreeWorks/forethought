"The Survey Mismatch": The paper cites a survey finding that moving from median to top researchers would increase progress 6×, using this as evidence that "smarter researchers" dramatically increase output. But this finding, if anything, supports complementarity rather than substitutability. The survey measures quality variation among humans who all operate under the same compute constraints—it says nothing about what happens when you hold compute fixed and add more smart researchers. A 6× gain from quality at fixed quantity is perfectly consistent with strong complementarity between cognitive labor (however skilled) and compute. The paper needs evidence about what happens when you vary quantity/quality of researchers while holding compute fixed, not evidence about quality differences at current compute levels. This survey actually cannot distinguish between the paper's position and Epoch's.
