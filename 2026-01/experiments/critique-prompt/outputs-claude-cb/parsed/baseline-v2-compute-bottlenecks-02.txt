"The Missing Mechanism for ρ Estimation" — The author claims that "most likely, -0.2 < ρ < 0" but provides no rigorous methodology for arriving at this estimate. The reasoning offered is informal—conversations with AI researchers about "specific things you could do with abundant cognitive labour" and intuitions about max speed being implausibly low below certain thresholds. This is precisely the kind of non-empirical reasoning the author criticizes in others. If economic estimates of ρ are unreliable due to "identification problems, confounders, data measurement issues," the author's preferred range based on researcher intuitions and thought experiments is surely even less reliable. The paper needs either empirical grounding for its ρ estimates or acknowledgment that its conclusions are essentially speculative.
