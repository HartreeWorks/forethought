"The Strongest Link Framing Proves Too Much" — Counterargument 7 proposes a "strongest link" framing where multiple routes to superintelligence exist and only one needs to work. But this framing, if taken seriously, would undermine not just the compute bottleneck objection but virtually any objection to an SIE. One could equally argue that alignment difficulties, regulatory intervention, or organizational failures won't matter because "you just need one route to work." The strongest link framing provides no principled way to distinguish which obstacles are genuine bottlenecks. Moreover, if multiple independent paths exist, we need evidence that at least one such path has favorable ρ—the mere possibility of multiple paths doesn't establish that any of them escape compute constraints.
