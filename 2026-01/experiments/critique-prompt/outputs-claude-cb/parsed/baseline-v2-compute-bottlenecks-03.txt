"The Conflation of Cognitive Labor Quality and Quantity" — Counterargument 4 notes that economic estimates don't account for workers becoming "smarter" or "thinking faster," and claims this should raise our estimate of ρ. However, this conflates two distinct dimensions of the input variable L. The CES model treats L as a single homogeneous input, but the author wants to simultaneously vary quantity of workers, quality of workers, and processing speed of workers. These three factors may have very different substitutability relationships with compute. It's entirely possible that more workers substitutes well for compute while smarter workers does not, or vice versa. Without disaggregating these effects, the claim that accounting for intelligence should "raise our estimate of ρ" is unsupported.
