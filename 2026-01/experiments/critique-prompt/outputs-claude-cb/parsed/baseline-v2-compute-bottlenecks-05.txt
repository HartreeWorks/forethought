"The Circular Reasoning About Max Speed Plausibility" — The author argues that economic estimates of ρ must be wrong because they imply "implausibly low" max speeds for AI progress. But the judgment that max speeds below 10x or 30x are implausible appears to derive from prior beliefs about how an SIE should proceed. This is circular: the author believes an SIE is likely, therefore max speeds must be high, therefore ρ must be near zero, therefore an SIE is likely. The paper acknowledges that reasoning about max speed "could be its own post" and that views are "informed by thinking through" possibilities with AI researchers, but this doesn't provide independent grounds for rejecting the economic estimates—it simply reasserts the prior that compute shouldn't be a strong bottleneck.
