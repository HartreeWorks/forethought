"The Late-Stage Irrelevance Problem": The paper concludes that compute bottlenecks "are unlikely to block an SIE in its early stages, but could well do so after a few OOMs of progress." But the entire motivation for worrying about SIE—stated in the intro—is that "you could shoot from human-level to superintelligent AI in a few months." If compute bottlenecks kick in "after a few OOMs," they would prevent exactly the scenario the paper frames as catastrophic. A world where AI improves 2-3 OOMs then plateaus is radically different from unbounded acceleration, yet the paper's conclusion treats this as a minor concession. The paper's own analysis, even granting all its assumptions, suggests that the "massive consequences" scenario requires ρ very close to zero—the most optimistic end of the paper's already-optimistic range. The paper has argued itself into a position where its headline claim (SIE is plausible) depends on parameters being at the extreme favorable end of its stated distribution.
