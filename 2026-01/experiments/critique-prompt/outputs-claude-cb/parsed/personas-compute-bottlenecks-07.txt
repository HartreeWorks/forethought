**[The Complexity Theorist]** The paper treats AI R&D as decomposable into "cognitive labor" and "compute" as separable inputs, but modern ML research exhibits strong emergent coupling between these factors that the CES model cannot capture. Algorithmic insights often only work at specific compute scales—techniques that improve efficiency at 10^23 FLOP may fail or reverse at 10^25 FLOP. The paper assumes efficiency gains compound multiplicatively, but empirically we see complex phase transitions: batch size scaling breaks down, certain architectures only emerge as optimal past threshold scales, and "scaling laws" themselves are discovered to have regime-specific validity. The substitution elasticity ρ isn't a constant—it's likely a function of the current capability level, with unknown discontinuities. The entire CES framework assumes smooth, predictable tradeoffs, but complex systems exhibit precisely the kind of non-linear interactions that make such extrapolations unreliable.
