"The Selective Application of CES Model Limitations" — The paper argues extensively that the CES model should not be trusted when extrapolating to AI R&D because it was designed for manufacturing contexts and tested only over narrow ranges of input variation. However, the author then proceeds to use the same CES framework to argue that ρ is likely between -0.2 and 0, and generates graphs showing how an SIE would proceed under these parameters. This is internally inconsistent: if the CES model is fundamentally unsuited for predicting AI R&D dynamics at extreme scales, then the author cannot legitimately use it to support their preferred conclusions about early-stage SIE feasibility. The paper wants to have it both ways—rejecting the model when it produces unfavorable estimates while embracing it when calibrated to favorable parameters.
