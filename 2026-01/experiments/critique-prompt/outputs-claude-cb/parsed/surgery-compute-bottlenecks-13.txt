> The paper's own confidence in ρ rests on intuitions about superintelligent capabilities—an extrapolation far wilder than the economic estimates it dismisses as "truly heroic."

**Load-bearing claim:**
The paper dismisses economic estimates because "extrapolating very very far" from observed L/K variation of ~2x to OOM changes is "truly heroic."

**Attack type:**
Causal reversal

This critique applies symmetrically to the paper's own reasoning. The paper's confidence that ρ is between -0.2 and 0 is based on informal reasoning about what superintelligent researchers "could do"—an extrapolation far beyond any observed researcher capability. If CES extrapolation is invalid for the skeptic, intuition-based extrapolation about superintelligent capabilities is equally invalid for the advocate. The paper cannot reject the skeptic's methodology while relying on even more speculative extrapolation for its own estimates.
