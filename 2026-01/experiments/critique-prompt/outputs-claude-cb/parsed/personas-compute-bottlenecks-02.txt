**[The Game-Theoretic Defector]** The paper assumes AI labs will actually pursue compute-efficient algorithmic improvements during an SIE, but ignores the competitive incentive structure. If Lab A discovers a 2x algorithmic efficiency gain, they face a choice: publish it (allowing competitors to also run 2x more experiments) or keep it secret and use their fixed compute to race ahead. The Nash equilibrium is secrecy, which means efficiency gains don't compound across the field—each lab hits its own compute ceiling independently. Furthermore, labs have strong incentives to exaggerate their algorithmic progress publicly while hoarding actual techniques, making it impossible to verify whether the "algorithmic efficiency gains" cited in the paper represent genuine substitutability or just marketing. The paper's entire framework assumes cooperative knowledge-sharing that game theory predicts won't occur under competitive pressure.
