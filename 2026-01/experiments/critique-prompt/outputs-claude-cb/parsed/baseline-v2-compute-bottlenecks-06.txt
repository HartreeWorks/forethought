"The Unexamined Assumption About Experiment Efficiency Gains" — Counterargument 5 claims that as AI algorithms become more efficient, labs can run more experiments with the same compute, thereby increasing both cognitive labor and experimental capacity simultaneously. However, this assumes that algorithmic efficiency gains during an SIE will continue at historical rates or accelerate—precisely the conclusion the paper is trying to establish. If compute bottlenecks do constrain the SIE, then the efficiency gains enabling more experiments would themselves slow down. The argument assumes away the bottleneck rather than addressing it. Additionally, the reply about "near-frontier experiments" is dismissed too quickly; the author's response that progress hasn't slowed despite fewer near-frontier experiments doesn't account for the possibility that we're still in a regime where small-scale experiments suffice, which may not hold indefinitely.
