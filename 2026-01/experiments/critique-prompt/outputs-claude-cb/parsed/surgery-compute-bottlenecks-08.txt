> The lack of 100x productivity gaps among human researchers despite huge IQ variation suggests we're already near the ceiling of what raw cognitive ability can extract, not that optimisation has been left on the table.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The paper claims max speeds of <30x are "implausible" based on reasoning about what superintelligent researchers could do (running smaller experiments, optimizing every part of the stack, etc.)

**Attack type:**
Causal reversal

The same evidence—that current AI progress has been rapid despite limited cognitive labor—could support the conclusion that we're *already* extracting most of the cognitive-labor-substitutable gains. If "optimizing every part of the stack" and "designing better experiments" were high-ρ activities, we'd expect current variations in researcher quality to show larger effects. The paper cites a 6x improvement from median-to-top researchers, but this is within the range the economic estimates would predict as achievable. The absence of observed 100x+ productivity differences among human researchers, despite enormous IQ variation, suggests the bottleneck is indeed binding, not that we haven't tried hard enough.
