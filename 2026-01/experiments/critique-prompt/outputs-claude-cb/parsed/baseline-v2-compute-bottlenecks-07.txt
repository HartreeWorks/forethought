"The Temporal Ambiguity in 'Early Stages'" — The paper's central conclusion is that "compute bottlenecks are unlikely to block an SIE in its early stages." However, "early stages" and "late stages" are never precisely defined. The paper variously references "1-3 OOMs" of cognitive labor increase as early stages and ">=5 OOMs" as later stages, but doesn't connect these to timeframes, capability levels, or meaningful milestones. If the "early stages" where bottlenecks don't bite correspond to only weeks or months of an SIE, and the problematic "late stages" begin before reaching superintelligence, then the practical implications differ dramatically from a scenario where early stages encompass most of the path to superintelligence. This ambiguity makes the paper's conclusions difficult to evaluate or falsify.
