**[The Political Economist]** The paper frames compute bottlenecks as a purely technical question about production functions, entirely ignoring that compute access is politically allocated. The labs most likely to approach an SIE are those with preferential access to chips, energy, and datacenter space—access determined by relationships with NVIDIA, nation-state compute initiatives, and hyperscaler partnerships. An SIE that "isn't bottlenecked by compute" in aggregate may still be bottlenecked by compute for any given actor, with the constraint being political rather than physical. Furthermore, if one lab appears to be achieving an SIE, compute will be actively withheld from competitors through export controls, exclusive contracts, and regulatory intervention. The paper's ρ analysis assumes compute is a tradeable commodity with market-clearing prices, but in practice compute allocation during an SIE would be a zero-sum geopolitical struggle where technical efficiency gains are dwarfed by access restrictions. Who controls the compute matters more than how efficiently it's used.
