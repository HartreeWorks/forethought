**[The Systems Engineer]** The paper's "strongest link" framing—that multiple routes to superintelligence mean you only need one to work—ignores that real R&D pipelines have interdependencies creating single points of failure. The paper lists "extrapolate from small experiments, design better experiments, scaffolding, data flywheels" as parallel paths, but each of these depends on shared infrastructure: evaluation frameworks, training data pipelines, model serving systems, and experimental tracking. If compute becomes a bottleneck, it bottlenecks all of these simultaneously because they share the same underlying resource. More importantly, the paper provides no analysis of graceful degradation—what happens when you're 80% of the way to a bottleneck? Systems don't transition smoothly from "accelerating" to "stuck"; they exhibit degraded performance, increased variance, and cascading delays well before hitting hard limits. The binary "SIE or not" framing obscures the messy reality of partial bottlenecks creating compounding coordination failures.
