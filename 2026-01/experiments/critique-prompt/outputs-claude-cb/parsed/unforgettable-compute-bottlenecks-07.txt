"The Definitional Escape Hatch": The paper concludes with a 10-40% probability of an SIE, defined as ">=5 OOMs of increase in effective training compute in <1 year without needing more hardware." But "effective training compute" is defined by algorithmic efficiency gains, which the paper earlier argued scale with cognitive labor inputs (counterargument 5). This definition allows the paper to count any algorithmic progress as evidence for the SIE, regardless of whether it required compute-heavy experiments. The paper has essentially defined SIE in terms of the output metric (effective compute) rather than the mechanism (feedback loop acceleration), making the claim nearly unfalsifiable. A skeptic who believes algorithmic progress will continue but plateau at some multiple of current speed would still see "effective training compute" increase—just not accelerate. The paper's framing obscures the actual crux about acceleration dynamics.
