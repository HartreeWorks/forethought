1. "The Selective Application of CES Model Limitations" — The paper argues extensively that the CES model should not be trusted when extrapolating to AI R&D because it was designed for manufacturing contexts and tested only over narrow ranges of input variation. However, the author then proceeds to use the same CES framework to argue that ρ is likely between -0.2 and 0, and generates graphs showing how an SIE would proceed under these parameters. This is internally inconsistent: if the CES model is fundamentally unsuited for predicting AI R&D dynamics at extreme scales, then the author cannot legitimately use it to support their preferred conclusions about early-stage SIE feasibility. The paper wants to have it both ways—rejecting the model when it produces unfavorable estimates while embracing it when calibrated to favorable parameters.

2. "The Missing Mechanism for ρ Estimation" — The author claims that "most likely, -0.2 < ρ < 0" but provides no rigorous methodology for arriving at this estimate. The reasoning offered is informal—conversations with AI researchers about "specific things you could do with abundant cognitive labour" and intuitions about max speed being implausibly low below certain thresholds. This is precisely the kind of non-empirical reasoning the author criticizes in others. If economic estimates of ρ are unreliable due to "identification problems, confounders, data measurement issues," the author's preferred range based on researcher intuitions and thought experiments is surely even less reliable. The paper needs either empirical grounding for its ρ estimates or acknowledgment that its conclusions are essentially speculative.

3. "The Conflation of Cognitive Labor Quality and Quantity" — Counterargument 4 notes that economic estimates don't account for workers becoming "smarter" or "thinking faster," and claims this should raise our estimate of ρ. However, this conflates two distinct dimensions of the input variable L. The CES model treats L as a single homogeneous input, but the author wants to simultaneously vary quantity of workers, quality of workers, and processing speed of workers. These three factors may have very different substitutability relationships with compute. It's entirely possible that more workers substitutes well for compute while smarter workers does not, or vice versa. Without disaggregating these effects, the claim that accounting for intelligence should "raise our estimate of ρ" is unsupported.

4. "The Strongest Link Framing Proves Too Much" — Counterargument 7 proposes a "strongest link" framing where multiple routes to superintelligence exist and only one needs to work. But this framing, if taken seriously, would undermine not just the compute bottleneck objection but virtually any objection to an SIE. One could equally argue that alignment difficulties, regulatory intervention, or organizational failures won't matter because "you just need one route to work." The strongest link framing provides no principled way to distinguish which obstacles are genuine bottlenecks. Moreover, if multiple independent paths exist, we need evidence that at least one such path has favorable ρ—the mere possibility of multiple paths doesn't establish that any of them escape compute constraints.

5. "The Circular Reasoning About Max Speed Plausibility" — The author argues that economic estimates of ρ must be wrong because they imply "implausibly low" max speeds for AI progress. But the judgment that max speeds below 10x or 30x are implausible appears to derive from prior beliefs about how an SIE should proceed. This is circular: the author believes an SIE is likely, therefore max speeds must be high, therefore ρ must be near zero, therefore an SIE is likely. The paper acknowledges that reasoning about max speed "could be its own post" and that views are "informed by thinking through" possibilities with AI researchers, but this doesn't provide independent grounds for rejecting the economic estimates—it simply reasserts the prior that compute shouldn't be a strong bottleneck.

6. "The Unexamined Assumption About Experiment Efficiency Gains" — Counterargument 5 claims that as AI algorithms become more efficient, labs can run more experiments with the same compute, thereby increasing both cognitive labor and experimental capacity simultaneously. However, this assumes that algorithmic efficiency gains during an SIE will continue at historical rates or accelerate—precisely the conclusion the paper is trying to establish. If compute bottlenecks do constrain the SIE, then the efficiency gains enabling more experiments would themselves slow down. The argument assumes away the bottleneck rather than addressing it. Additionally, the reply about "near-frontier experiments" is dismissed too quickly; the author's response that progress hasn't slowed despite fewer near-frontier experiments doesn't account for the possibility that we're still in a regime where small-scale experiments suffice, which may not hold indefinitely.

7. "The Temporal Ambiguity in 'Early Stages'" — The paper's central conclusion is that "compute bottlenecks are unlikely to block an SIE in its early stages." However, "early stages" and "late stages" are never precisely defined. The paper variously references "1-3 OOMs" of cognitive labor increase as early stages and ">=5 OOMs" as later stages, but doesn't connect these to timeframes, capability levels, or meaningful milestones. If the "early stages" where bottlenecks don't bite correspond to only weeks or months of an SIE, and the problematic "late stages" begin before reaching superintelligence, then the practical implications differ dramatically from a scenario where early stages encompass most of the path to superintelligence. This ambiguity makes the paper's conclusions difficult to evaluate or falsify.

8. "The Neglected Role of Data as a Third Input" — The CES framework as applied throughout the paper considers only two inputs: cognitive labor (L) and compute (K). However, AI R&D also requires training data, which has its own supply constraints and substitutability relationships. The paper never addresses whether data might constitute an additional bottleneck with its own ρ parameter. If high-quality training data has low substitutability with cognitive labor—plausible given that no amount of researcher intelligence can conjure novel data from nothing—then the two-input CES model fundamentally misspecifies the production function. This omission is particularly significant given recent concerns about training data exhaustion and the increasing difficulty of curating useful datasets.

9. "The Unsubstantiated Claim About Long-Run ρ" — The paper relies heavily on the claim that "longer-run estimates of ρ tend to give higher results" and that "Cobb Douglas is a good model for long-run growth" (implying ρ=0). However, the cited source (Jones 2003) is a single paper with a specific hypothesis, not established consensus. The paper presents this as settled fact while simultaneously arguing that economic estimates are generally unreliable. Moreover, the analogy between long-run economic adjustment (occurring over years or decades) and potential AI-driven reconfiguration (claimed to happen in "days or weeks") is asserted without justification. The mechanisms enabling long-run ρ convergence to zero in traditional economies—institutional adaptation, capital formation, technological diffusion—may have no analogue in rapid AI development.

10. "The Definitional Gerrymandering of 'Software Intelligence Explosion'" — The paper concludes by defining an SIE as ">=5 OOMs of increase in effective training compute in <1 years without needing more hardware" and estimates a 10-40% probability. But this definition appears chosen to be achievable even under moderate compute constraints, rather than capturing what matters about explosive AI development. Five orders of magnitude of effective compute improvement, if stretched over nearly a full year, might not produce the "shoot from human-level to superintelligent AI in a few months" scenario described in the introduction as motivating concern about SIE. The paper's framing shifts between an alarming scenario where "society wouldn't have time to prepare" and a technical definition that could be satisfied by relatively gradual progress. This makes it unclear whether the 10-40% estimate addresses the scenario of genuine concern.
