1. **[The Empirical Hardliner]** The paper claims that ρ values between -0.2 and 0 are "most likely" for AI R&D, but provides zero empirical evidence specific to AI research productivity. The author dismisses economic estimates of ρ (ranging from -1.2 to -0.15) as inapplicable, then substitutes personal intuitions about "optimising every part of the stack" and conversations with unnamed AI researchers. Where is the data on how AI research output actually scales with researcher count at fixed compute? Where are the controlled experiments varying cognitive labor inputs while holding compute constant? The author's "max speed seems implausibly low" argument is pure intuition pump—there's no identified causal mechanism explaining why AI R&D should have fundamentally different substitution elasticity than other empirically-studied domains. If the claim is that AI R&D is special, the burden is to demonstrate this empirically, not to gesture at theoretical possibilities like "AGIs doing math in their heads to simulate experiments."

2. **[The Game-Theoretic Defector]** The paper assumes AI labs will actually pursue compute-efficient algorithmic improvements during an SIE, but ignores the competitive incentive structure. If Lab A discovers a 2x algorithmic efficiency gain, they face a choice: publish it (allowing competitors to also run 2x more experiments) or keep it secret and use their fixed compute to race ahead. The Nash equilibrium is secrecy, which means efficiency gains don't compound across the field—each lab hits its own compute ceiling independently. Furthermore, labs have strong incentives to exaggerate their algorithmic progress publicly while hoarding actual techniques, making it impossible to verify whether the "algorithmic efficiency gains" cited in the paper represent genuine substitutability or just marketing. The paper's entire framework assumes cooperative knowledge-sharing that game theory predicts won't occur under competitive pressure.

3. **[The Mechanism Designer]** The paper hand-waves that "experiments can become more compute-efficient" and that labs can "extrapolate from experiments that use increasingly small fractions of compute," but provides no formal specification of what this extrapolation function looks like or when it breaks down. What is the mathematical relationship between experiment scale and information gained about frontier performance? At what point does the extrapolation error exceed the signal? The claim that "the number of near-frontier experiments has significantly decreased while algorithmic progress continued" is offered as evidence, but without a formal model of how information from sub-frontier experiments transfers to frontier predictions, this proves nothing—maybe we've just been lucky, or maybe we're already accumulating extrapolation debt that will come due. Until someone specifies the actual extrapolation mechanism and its failure conditions, "you might not need near-frontier experiments" is wishful thinking dressed as analysis.

4. **[The Institutional Corruptionist]** The paper's optimistic SIE scenario assumes that AI labs will accurately report their algorithmic efficiency gains and compute usage, but these metrics are unauditable and labs have overwhelming incentives to manipulate them. "Algorithmic efficiency" improvements can be fabricated by cherry-picking benchmarks, adjusting evaluation protocols, or quietly increasing actual compute while claiming otherwise. The paper cites "the past ten years" of algorithmic progress without acknowledging that these efficiency claims come from the same labs competing for investment and talent. When the paper assumes we can measure whether progress is "compute-bottlenecked" or "cognitive-labor-bottlenecked," it presupposes a transparency that doesn't exist. An SIE could appear to be happening on paper while actually being driven by undisclosed compute scaling, and we'd have no way to tell until the bottleneck suddenly materialized.

5. **[The Second-Order Catastrophist]** Suppose the paper is correct that compute bottlenecks don't kick in until "a few OOMs of progress" into the SIE. This means we get rapid, largely unconstrained algorithmic improvement for months or years before hitting any natural speed limit. The paper frames this as good news for SIE believers, but consider the failure mode: a sudden, unpredictable transition from "progress accelerating freely" to "hard wall." Labs will have built organizational structures, raised capital, and made commitments premised on continued acceleration. When the bottleneck hits, they face massive sunk costs and pressure to find workarounds—potentially including abandoning safety-relevant compute overhead, cutting corners on alignment testing, or racing to deploy undertested systems before competitors. The paper's "good chance bottlenecks don't slow things until late stages" is precisely the setup for a whiplash transition where the deceleration itself causes catastrophic decision-making.

6. **[The Historical Parallelist]** The paper argues that long-run estimates of ρ trend toward zero because "we invent new production processes that use our new balance of inputs more effectively," citing Jones (2003). But the historical cases where this rebalancing occurred—the Industrial Revolution, electrification, computerization—all involved decades of institutional adaptation, workforce retraining, and infrastructure development. The paper claims AGIs could achieve this reconfiguration "in days or weeks," but historical parallels suggest that the binding constraints on production reorganization are often social and institutional, not purely cognitive. When factories first got electric motors, they initially just replaced steam engines one-for-one; it took 30 years to realize you could redesign factory layouts around distributed power. The AGIs might think fast, but convincing human institutions to reorganize around new production methods has never been a pure speed-of-thought problem. The paper assumes away the actual historical bottleneck.

7. **[The Complexity Theorist]** The paper treats AI R&D as decomposable into "cognitive labor" and "compute" as separable inputs, but modern ML research exhibits strong emergent coupling between these factors that the CES model cannot capture. Algorithmic insights often only work at specific compute scales—techniques that improve efficiency at 10^23 FLOP may fail or reverse at 10^25 FLOP. The paper assumes efficiency gains compound multiplicatively, but empirically we see complex phase transitions: batch size scaling breaks down, certain architectures only emerge as optimal past threshold scales, and "scaling laws" themselves are discovered to have regime-specific validity. The substitution elasticity ρ isn't a constant—it's likely a function of the current capability level, with unknown discontinuities. The entire CES framework assumes smooth, predictable tradeoffs, but complex systems exhibit precisely the kind of non-linear interactions that make such extrapolations unreliable.

8. **[The Cognitive Scientist]** The paper claims that surveyed AI researchers estimate moving from "median employee" to "top employee" researchers would increase progress pace by 6x, treating this as evidence for high cognitive-labor returns. But this estimate is subject to massive anchoring effects, availability bias, and self-serving attribution. Researchers systematically overestimate the contribution of insight versus luck and compute, because insights are memorable and narratively satisfying while "we tried 500 things and one worked" is not. The paper also assumes that "smarter" AGI researchers would produce proportionally more progress, but cognitive science research on expert performance suggests diminishing returns to raw intelligence past threshold competence—domain knowledge, tacit skills, and serendipitous exposure to the right problems matter enormously. The implicit model where "2x smarter = 2x faster progress" has no empirical support in studies of human research productivity.

9. **[The Systems Engineer]** The paper's "strongest link" framing—that multiple routes to superintelligence mean you only need one to work—ignores that real R&D pipelines have interdependencies creating single points of failure. The paper lists "extrapolate from small experiments, design better experiments, scaffolding, data flywheels" as parallel paths, but each of these depends on shared infrastructure: evaluation frameworks, training data pipelines, model serving systems, and experimental tracking. If compute becomes a bottleneck, it bottlenecks all of these simultaneously because they share the same underlying resource. More importantly, the paper provides no analysis of graceful degradation—what happens when you're 80% of the way to a bottleneck? Systems don't transition smoothly from "accelerating" to "stuck"; they exhibit degraded performance, increased variance, and cascading delays well before hitting hard limits. The binary "SIE or not" framing obscures the messy reality of partial bottlenecks creating compounding coordination failures.

10. **[The Political Economist]** The paper frames compute bottlenecks as a purely technical question about production functions, entirely ignoring that compute access is politically allocated. The labs most likely to approach an SIE are those with preferential access to chips, energy, and datacenter space—access determined by relationships with NVIDIA, nation-state compute initiatives, and hyperscaler partnerships. An SIE that "isn't bottlenecked by compute" in aggregate may still be bottlenecked by compute for any given actor, with the constraint being political rather than physical. Furthermore, if one lab appears to be achieving an SIE, compute will be actively withheld from competitors through export controls, exclusive contracts, and regulatory intervention. The paper's ρ analysis assumes compute is a tradeable commodity with market-clearing prices, but in practice compute allocation during an SIE would be a zero-sum geopolitical struggle where technical efficiency gains are dwarfed by access restrictions. Who controls the compute matters more than how efficiently it's used.
