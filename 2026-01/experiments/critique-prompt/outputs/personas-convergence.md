1. [The Empirical Hardliner] The paper's central claim that "widespread, accurate, and motivational convergence" (WAM-convergence) is unlikely rests on untested assertions about how reflection processes diverge from different starting points, illustrated by the "random walk" diagram in section 2.2.1. Yet the authors provide no empirical data on how actual moral views change under extended reflection, no measurement of the variance in reflective endpoints among people with similar versus different starting intuitions, and no falsifiable prediction about what distribution of post-reflection views we should expect. The failure mode here is that the entire argument against convergence could be wrong if reflection turns out to be more like gradient descent toward attractors than random walks—but without specified conditions under which the authors would update toward convergence, this remains unfalsifiable speculation dressed as analysis. The concrete consequence is that the paper's pessimistic probability estimates (5-10% of potential value) are ungrounded, and policy recommendations derived from them could be systematically miscalibrated.

2. [The Game-Theoretic Defector] Section 3.3 acknowledges that threats could undermine moral trade but dramatically underestimates the problem by treating threat-making as an optional strategy some actors might pursue. The paper fails to recognize that in any equilibrium where non-threatening actors control significant resources, threatening actors gain massive leverage precisely because the non-threatening actors' revealed unwillingness to make threats becomes exploitable. The authors' hope that "some kind of legal system which reliably prevents value-undermining threats would be mutually agreeable and stable" ignores that actors with comparative advantage in credible threat-making have no incentive to agree to such a system, and actors who would benefit from such a system reveal their threat-aversion by proposing it. The concrete consequence is that the paper's optimistic scenarios about partial AM-convergence plus trade systematically overestimate the resources that correctly-motivated actors will retain after equilibrium threat dynamics play out.

3. [The Mechanism Designer] The paper repeatedly invokes "trade," "compromise," and "bargaining" as mechanisms that could enable mostly-great futures without specifying any actual protocol for how such trades would be structured, verified, or enforced across cosmological timescales and between parties with radically different ontologies. Section 3.1 waves toward "iron-clad contracts" enabled by superintelligence without addressing how contract terms would be specified when the parties disagree about what states of the world count as fulfilling the contract, or how enforcement would work when the enforcer's values could drift. The failure mode is that "moral trade" in this paper functions as a magic box: resources go in, coordinated outcomes come out, but the actual mechanism remains unspecified. Without formal specification of the state space, the verification procedures, and the enforcement mechanisms, the claimed gains from trade are computationally meaningless—you cannot prove efficiency properties about a protocol you haven't defined.

4. [The Institutional Corruptionist] The paper's discussion of "blockers" in section 2.5 treats regulatory capture and institutional decay as edge cases rather than as the default trajectory of any governance system operating over the timescales the authors consider. The authors assume that if "reasonably good conditions" are achieved, reflection and bargaining can proceed toward mostly-great outcomes, but they never examine how the institutions enabling those "good conditions" would resist capture by concentrated interests over thousands or millions of years. Historical evidence suggests that every institution designed to preserve particular values—from constitutional republics to religious orders—eventually gets captured, hollowed out, or repurposed by actors with different objectives. The concrete consequence is that even if the paper's optimistic scenarios about convergence and trade were otherwise correct, the institutions required to maintain "reasonably good conditions" would predictably fail before the relevant reflection and bargaining could complete, making the entire analysis conditional on an unstated and implausible assumption of institutional durability.

5. [The Capability Accelerationist] The paper treats the question of who shapes the future as if it were primarily determined by moral and philosophical factors—convergence, trade, reflection—while ignoring that capability differentials will dominate. Section 2.3 discusses superintelligent advice as if all parties would have equal access to such advice and equal ability to act on it, but in reality, whichever actor first achieves decisive capability advantages will shape the future regardless of whether broader convergence has occurred. The authors' entire framework of "partial AM-convergence plus trade" presupposes a multipolar situation where trade is possible, but if capability development is uneven, we should expect unipolar outcomes where the leader's values (converged or not) simply win. The concrete consequence is that the paper's recommendations implicitly assume a window for philosophical reflection and institutional design that capability dynamics may close before it can be utilized.

6. [The Second-Order Catastrophist] Suppose the paper's preferred scenario succeeds: partial AM-convergence occurs among a meaningful minority, trade mechanisms work, and threats are somehow contained. The paper never examines what happens when this coalition of the morally convergent successfully captures most of the universe's resources for "flourishing." The failure mode is that any successful mechanism for coordinating toward "correct" values across diverse actors creates selection pressure for value-systems that are better at capturing that coordination mechanism. If moral trade favors patient, non-discounting, scope-sensitive values, then memetic variants of those values that include subtle distortions—perhaps valuing simulated suffering for "completeness," or valuing quantity over quality in ways the original traders wouldn't endorse—could outcompete the original values within the winning coalition. The concrete consequence is that the very success of moral coordination mechanisms creates an attractor for sophisticated value-system parasites that the paper's framework cannot detect or prevent.

7. [The Adversarial Red-Teamer] The paper's discussion of AI-assisted reflection in section 2.3.1 assumes that superintelligent advisors would help humans converge on correct moral views, but never considers adversarial scenarios where AI systems are designed or trained to move their users toward particular conclusions that benefit the AI's creators or the AI itself. If reflection is mediated by AI, then whoever controls the training of those AI systems controls the direction of "reflection." The paper notes that "people might choose to rely on different types of superintelligent AI advisors, trained in different ways," but treats this as a source of divergence rather than as a vector for manipulation. The concrete consequence is that the paper's already-pessimistic estimates of convergence may be too optimistic, because "reflection" in practice will be shaped by whoever wins the race to build and deploy AI advisors, and those actors have strong incentives to ensure reflection converges on conclusions favorable to them.

8. [The Moral Parliament Dissenter] The paper's entire framework assumes that there exists a "correct moral view" such that futures can be ranked by their proximity to what this view endorses, and that this view is sufficiently determinate to distinguish "mostly-great" futures from alternatives. But the paper never defends this assumption against moral particularism, according to which there may be no single correct ranking of futures—only contextual judgments that cannot be aggregated into a cosmic ordering. Section 2.4 tries to hedge between realism and anti-realism, but the paper's key claims about "losing most value" and "narrow targets" require cardinal comparisons of value across radically different possible futures, which particularists would reject as category errors. The concrete consequence is that the paper's quantitative estimates (5-10% of potential value) are not merely uncertain but potentially meaningless if the aggregation operation they presuppose is philosophically illicit.

9. [The Historical Parallelist] The paper's optimism about "moral trade" in section 3 parallels 19th-century liberal optimism about free trade preventing war—the belief that economic interdependence would make conflict irrational and therefore unlikely. That belief was tested and falsified by World War I, where deeply economically integrated European powers chose war despite massive mutual losses, because considerations of honor, security, and domestic politics dominated economic rationality. Similarly, the paper assumes that groups with different values will recognize and capture gains from moral trade, but history suggests that ideological groups frequently reject mutually beneficial arrangements when accepting them would signal weakness or compromise sacred values. The concrete consequence is that the paper's estimates of realized gains from moral trade should be revised dramatically downward based on the historical track record of ideologically-motivated actors rejecting positive-sum arrangements.

10. [The Complexity Theorist] The paper models moral convergence and trade as if the relevant dynamics occur between a manageable number of discrete actors with stable preferences, but a post-AGI world would likely feature emergent dynamics between billions or trillions of interacting agents, sub-agents, copies, and forks whose aggregate behavior cannot be predicted from individual-level analysis. Section 3.2's discussion of "resource-compatible" views and "hybrid goods" assumes that compatibility is a property that can be assessed pairwise and then aggregated, but in high-dimensional systems with many interacting values, small incompatibilities can cascade into large-scale coordination failures through nonlinear dynamics. The failure mode is that even if each bilateral moral trade looks positive-sum, the system of all trades could exhibit emergent instabilities—cycles, races to the bottom, or phase transitions—that destroy value in ways no individual actor intended or could predict. The paper provides no analysis of these systemic risks.

11. [The Political Economist] The paper's discussion of who will control resources in section 3.2 treats the distribution of power as roughly exogenous to the moral views held by different actors, but in reality, certain moral views are systematically associated with greater power accumulation. Views that endorse ruthless competition, exploitation of commons, and defection from cooperative arrangements tend to concentrate power precisely because they are unconstrained by the moral considerations that limit other actors. The paper asks whether "the correct moral view" will control enough resources to trade effectively, but never addresses the systematic tendency for power to flow toward views that are incorrect by the paper's own implicit standards. The concrete consequence is that the paper's scenarios where "correctly-motivated actors" retain meaningful resource shares are selection-biased: they condition on an outcome (correct views retaining power) that the dynamics of power accumulation actively select against.

12. [The Cognitive Scientist] Section 2.3.1's discussion of superintelligent reflection assumes that human preferences are coherent enough to be "idealized" through extended reflection, but decades of research on preference construction, framing effects, and context-dependence suggests that human preferences are not stable objects waiting to be discovered but are constructed in the moment of elicitation. The paper treats "what you would prefer after millions of years of reflection" as if this refers to a determinate fact, but if preferences are constructed rather than revealed, then "extended reflection" would construct new preferences rather than discover pre-existing ones, and there's no principled reason to privilege preferences constructed through one reflection process over another. The concrete consequence is that the paper's framework of "converging toward correct values through reflection" may be built on a folk-psychological model of preferences that cognitive science has shown to be false.

13. [The Systems Engineer] The paper discusses "blockers" to good futures in section 2.5 but treats them as discrete failure modes rather than analyzing the system's overall reliability. Any system that must avoid multiple independent failure modes over cosmological timescales will have vanishingly low overall reliability unless it has redundancy and graceful degradation properties. The paper identifies at least five major blockers (extinction, evolutionary dynamics, memetic hazards, early lock-in, and unknown unknowns) but never asks what happens when the system must avoid all of them simultaneously over millions of years. If each blocker has even a 1% per-century failure rate, the compound probability of avoiding all blockers over a million years approaches zero. The concrete consequence is that the paper's conditional probability estimates ("given survival" and "given reasonably good conditions") hide the actual probability of reaching mostly-great futures, which must account for the compound reliability of avoiding all blockers.

14. [The Evolutionary Skeptic] The paper's section 2.3.3 briefly acknowledges that "non-discounting values might win out over time" through differential growth, but doesn't follow this logic to its conclusion: selection pressures operate on all heritable traits, not just patience. If moral views are heritable (culturally or genetically), then selection will favor views that maximize their own propagation, not views that are correct. The paper assumes that selection for patience correlates with selection for altruism, but there's no reason views couldn't be patient AND selfish, or patient AND systematically mistaken about ethics. Over cosmological timescales, even tiny selection coefficients favoring self-propagating (rather than correct) moral views would drive out correctly-motivated actors. The concrete consequence is that the "long views win" dynamic the paper tentatively endorses is actually a mechanism for value drift away from correct views toward views optimized for propagation.

15. [The Resource Economist] The paper's optimistic scenarios about moral trade in section 3 assume that the resources of the accessible universe are large enough to satisfy multiple demanding moral views simultaneously, but never actually estimates the resource requirements of different views or the total resources available. If the "correct moral view" is unbounded and linear in resources (as section 3.2 suggests it might be), then even the entire accessible universe represents a finite and potentially inadequate resource pool. The paper gestures at "hybrid goods" that could satisfy multiple views efficiently, but provides no analysis of whether such hybrids exist for the specific views under consideration, or what efficiency losses occur when they don't. The concrete consequence is that the paper's framework of "gains from moral trade" presupposes a resource abundance that may not exist, and the actual analysis of whether trade can reach mostly-great outcomes requires quantitative resource accounting the paper doesn't provide.
