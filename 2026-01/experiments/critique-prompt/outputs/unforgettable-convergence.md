1. "The Reflection Lottery" attacks the paper's central inference that partial AM-convergence plus trade could yield a mostly-great future because different people with different starting preferences would converge sufficiently through reflection. The paper assumes that among the minority who do reflect earnestly on the good de dicto, there will be enough overlap in their conclusions to enable mutually beneficial trade. But if reflection is genuinely open-ended and the target is genuinely narrow (as the authors themselves argue), then even the small fraction of altruistically-motivated reflectors will scatter across the vast space of possible moral conclusions like lottery balls. The paper cannot simultaneously maintain that (a) the target is so narrow that widespread convergence is unlikely, and (b) the minority who do engage in reflection will cluster tightly enough around correct views to control meaningful resource shares. If this objection holds, the authors would need to either abandon the "narrow target" framing that motivates their entire project, or provide a mechanism for why altruistic reflectors specifically would converge when others wouldn't.

2. "The Narcissism Boomerang" targets the paper's argument that resource-compatible views could achieve hybrid goods through trade. The authors introduce the "narcissism of small differences" concept to explain why superficially similar views might have smaller gains from trade—Annie and Bob both care about worship but can't compromise on which deity. But this principle, properly generalized, undermines the entire optimistic case for moral trade. The views most likely to engage in earnest moral trade are precisely those that take morality seriously and have strong convictions about what matters—and such views are exactly the ones most likely to exhibit narcissism of small differences with each other. Meanwhile, views that are genuinely resource-compatible (one cares about wisdom, another about bliss) are probably held by people with such different psychological profiles that they're unlikely to be trading partners in the first place. The paper needs a principled account of which view-pairs are both resource-compatible AND plausible trading partners.

3. "The Threat Asymmetry Trap" attacks the inference that preventing value-destroying threats would make trade scenarios much more optimistic. The paper argues that if threats can be prevented, "it's just on the linear views that we don't reach a mostly-great future via compromise and trade." But the capacity to prevent threats requires enforcement mechanisms, and enforcement mechanisms themselves create new threat vectors. Any system powerful enough to prevent Alice from threatening to harm animals unless Bob pays her is also powerful enough to be captured by whichever coalition controls it, who can then use that enforcement capacity to extract concessions from others. The paper treats threat-prevention as a clean intervention, but the authors have given no reason to think the cure isn't worse than the disease—especially since, by their own logic, whoever controls enforcement would face the same lack of convergence pressures as everyone else.

4. "The Motivational Gap Cannot Close" challenges the paper's central move of treating "reasonably good conditions" as achievable while separately analyzing what happens under such conditions. The authors define reasonably good conditions as having "no major blockers" and then proceed to analyze convergence assuming we reach them. But the paper's own arguments about why WAM-convergence is unlikely apply equally to convergence on what counts as "reasonably good conditions" in the first place. If people won't converge on correct moral views even with superintelligent assistance, they certainly won't converge on the institutional arrangements, decision-making procedures, and enforcement mechanisms that would constitute "reasonably good conditions." The analysis is thus question-begging: it assumes we can coordinate on the prerequisites for coordination while arguing we can't coordinate on the outcomes.

5. "The Realism-Antirealism Squeeze" targets the paper's argument structure in section 2.4, which claims pessimism follows on both horns of the realism/antirealism dilemma. The authors argue that given realism, correct views are probably alien and unmotivating; given antirealism, there's no convergence target. But this framing hides a third possibility the authors don't adequately address: that the correct metaethical view is some form of constructivism where convergence is possible precisely because the "correct" view is partly constituted by what reflective agents would converge on. On such views, the question isn't whether agents converge on some mind-independent truth, but whether the convergence process itself is well-structured. The paper dismisses "objectively correct idealizing processes" as inconsistent with antirealism's motivations, but constructivism isn't antirealism—it's a view on which correctness is real but convergence-dependent. If constructivism is true, the entire argument structure collapses.

6. "The Selection Pressure Reversal" attacks the argument in section 2.3.3 that "long views win" through asymmetric growth. The authors suggest that patient, non-discounting altruistic values might come to dominate through differential savings and fertility. But the same selection logic that favors patience could favor patience in service of *any* goal, including goals antithetical to the good. A patient sadist or a patient power-seeker benefits from the same selection pressures as a patient altruist. Moreover, the selection pressure for non-discounting values is also a selection pressure for values that are *good at spreading themselves*, which may be orthogonal or opposed to values that are *correct*. The paper's own logic suggests that what wins out is memetic fitness, not moral accuracy. If this objection holds, the "long views win" consideration should actually increase pessimism.

7. "The Abundance Paradox" challenges the inference from diminishing marginal utility to increased altruistic spending in section 2.3.2. The authors acknowledge that billionaires today spend only ~6% of their income on philanthropy despite steeply diminishing returns to self-interested consumption, but then wave this away by noting that "more advanced technology provides greater scope to spend money in self-interested ways." This is precisely the problem: if self-interested preferences can always expand to absorb additional resources (through positional goods, copies of oneself, experiences of ownership, etc.), then there's no level of abundance at which altruistic preferences necessarily dominate. The authors have provided a mechanism for why altruistic spending *could* increase with abundance but simultaneously provided the counter-mechanism that explains why it *won't*. They need to argue that one mechanism dominates the other, which they haven't done.

8. "The Hybrid Goods Illusion" attacks the paper's reliance on the possibility that two views can be "resource-compatible" through creating "hybrid goods" that satisfy both. The paper offers the example of hedonists and objective list theorists agreeing to create beings that are both blissful and wise. But this assumes that hybrid goods are nearly as efficient at producing value-per-resource as optimized goods would be for each view separately. If being maximally blissful requires cognitive architectures incompatible with wisdom, or vice versa, then the "hybrid" represents a substantial discount for both parties. The paper offers no argument that hybrid goods don't involve such discounts—and given the "narrow target" premise, we should expect that optimal states for different views are highly particular and non-overlapping. The hybrid goods concept may be mostly empty.

9. "The Random Walk Cuts Both Ways" targets the paper's use of the random walk analogy in section 2.2.1, where moral reflection is visualized as walks that diverge from a shared origin. The authors argue that current agreement is misleading because people haven't walked far yet, and further reflection will cause divergence. But random walks are symmetric in time: if we don't know which direction is "correct," the random walk analogy provides no reason to think current positions are *worse* than future positions will be. The analogy only supports pessimism if you assume current positions are better than chance and reflection adds noise. But if current positions are worse than chance (perhaps due to evolutionary biases), reflection could cause convergence. The authors' use of this analogy depends on an unstated assumption about the current quality of moral beliefs that they haven't defended.

10. "The Meta-Ethical Confidence Problem" attacks the paper's practice of drawing conclusions by conditioning on different metaethical views. The authors argue that given realism, X follows; given antirealism, Y follows; therefore we should be pessimistic. But this inference pattern only works if our uncertainty across metaethical views is well-calibrated. If we're systematically overconfident in antirealism (perhaps because it's culturally dominant in academic philosophy), then the paper's pessimistic conclusions are driven by that miscalibration rather than by the object-level considerations. More fundamentally, the authors never justify treating metaethical uncertainty as irreducible—perhaps superintelligent reflection could resolve metaethical questions, in which case conditioning on both horns is premature. The paper needs an argument that metaethical uncertainty persists even under the "reasonably good conditions" they're analyzing.

11. "The Externality Blindspot" challenges the paper's framing of trade as occurring between agents with different moral views who control separable resource shares. Real moral trade, the paper assumes, involves discrete parties agreeing to exchanges. But many of the most important moral questions concern externalities—effects on parties who aren't at the bargaining table. Digital minds that could be created, future generations, animals, and potential persons have no resources with which to trade. The paper's trade framework systematically ignores these constituencies, but the "narrow target" of a mostly-great future presumably includes getting their interests right. Trade between existing powerful parties provides no mechanism for representing these interests unless some traders happen to care about them—bringing us back to the convergence problem the paper already deemed unlikely. The trade framework is thus far less general than the paper suggests.

12. "The Lock-In Timing Problem" attacks the paper's deferred discussion of lock-in as a "blocker" while proceeding to analyze scenarios assuming no lock-in. The authors acknowledge that early lock-in could make it "impossible for later generations to produce a mostly-great future," but they structure their analysis as if lock-in considerations are independent of convergence considerations. They're not. If lock-in happens early (which is plausible given rapid AI development), then the only convergence that matters is convergence among early decision-makers, who will by construction have had less time for reflection than the paper's analysis assumes. The paper's optimistic scenarios all depend on eventually reaching good conditions, but lock-in means "eventually" might never come. This isn't an additional blocker to consider separately—it undermines the entire analytical framework.

13. "The Will MacAskill Update Paradox" reveals a tension in the paper's own credibility. The authors note that Will revised his estimate of expected future value from <1% to 5-10% after exposure to these arguments. But the arguments in section 2 suggest that convergence is unlikely even among earnest reflectors with similar starting points. If Will's update is evidence that these arguments are compelling, it should also make us wonder why other thoughtful people haven't updated similarly—suggesting either the arguments aren't that compelling, or that even compelling arguments don't produce convergence. The paper can't use Will's update as evidence of the arguments' force while simultaneously arguing that compelling arguments won't produce convergence. Either the update is epistemically suspicious, or the pessimism about convergence is overstated.

14. "The Common-Sense Utopia Escape Hatch" targets the paper's recurring reference to "common-sense utopia" as a state where common-sense ethical views get most of what they want. The paper uses this concept to suggest that even if WAM-convergence fails, perhaps most people converging on common-sense views would be good enough. But "common-sense ethical views" is doing enormous unacknowledged work here. Common sense in 1800 endorsed slavery; common sense in 1950 endorsed racial segregation; common sense today may endorse factory farming. The paper provides no argument that common-sense views after superintelligent reflection would be better rather than worse than common-sense views today, especially if (as the paper suggests) memetic pressures, social conformity, and selection effects shape which views become "common sense." This escape hatch may lead to a mostly-terrible future that feels fine to its inhabitants.

15. "The Scope Sensitivity Shell Game" attacks the paper's framing of the difference between bounded and unbounded moral views as crucial for whether trade can achieve mostly-great futures. The authors argue that bounded views are more likely to be satisfied through trade, while unbounded views face the "narcissism of small differences" problem. But whether a view is bounded or unbounded often depends on arbitrary framings. Is hedonistic utilitarianism bounded (there's a maximum hedonic intensity) or unbounded (there can always be more experiencers)? Is a preference for biodiversity bounded (finite species) or unbounded (infinite possible ecosystems)? The paper's conclusions about which scenarios lead to mostly-great futures depend on how views are categorized, but the categorization scheme is underdetermined by the views themselves. This makes the analysis less action-guiding than it appears, since we can't confidently place actual moral views into the paper's taxonomy.
