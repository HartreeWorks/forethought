"The Normalization Nullification" undermines the paper's intertheoretic comparison discussion. The paper surveys various normalization methods and notes they disagree significantly. But this disagreement is presented as neutral when it actually favors the "easy eutopia" position—if experts cannot agree on how to aggregate views, we have little reason to act on any particular aggregation. The paper uses intertheoretic uncertainty to suggest we should be fussy, but such deep uncertainty about how to even compare views suggests we should be epistemically humble about any strong claims regarding how difficult eutopia is. The paper's own demonstration of normalization disagreement undercuts confidence in its fussiness conclusion.
