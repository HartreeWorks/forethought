**Load-bearing claim 1 (Moral convergence under good conditions is unlikely given antirealism)** — *Causal reversal*: The paper interprets persistent moral disagreement as evidence that reflection doesn't reliably converge, supporting pessimism about WAM-convergence. But the same evidence equally supports an opposite conclusion: disagreement persists precisely because we haven't yet created the "reasonably good conditions" the paper stipulates—conditions including superintelligent assistance, cognitive abundance, and resolution of empirical disputes. Historical disagreement may tell us nothing about disagreement under genuinely ideal conditions, just as pre-scientific disagreement about physics tells us little about whether physics converges under scientific conditions. If the causal story reverses this way, the paper's appeal to current disagreement as evidence against future convergence commits a reference class error—treating pre-ideal conditions as informative about post-ideal outcomes.
