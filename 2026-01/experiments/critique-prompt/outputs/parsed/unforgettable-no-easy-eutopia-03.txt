"The Fat Tail Inversion" challenges the inference that fat-tailed distributions of value-efficiency make eutopia harder to achieve. The paper argues that because the best uses of resources are much better than typical uses, hitting the narrow peak is necessary. But fat-tailed distributions also mean that the difference between the 90th and 99th percentile is small compared to the difference between the 50th and 90th percentile—so once you're doing reasonably well, you're already capturing most of the value. The same evidence about fat tails that supposedly makes eutopia hard could equally suggest that "pretty good" captures most of what matters. The paper would need to show specifically where on the distribution the 50% threshold falls, which requires empirical claims it doesn't make.
