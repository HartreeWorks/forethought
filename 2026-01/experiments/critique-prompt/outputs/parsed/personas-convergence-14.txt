The paper's section 2.3.3 briefly acknowledges that "non-discounting values might win out over time" through differential growth, but doesn't follow this logic to its conclusion: selection pressures operate on all heritable traits, not just patience. If moral views are heritable (culturally or genetically), then selection will favor views that maximize their own propagation, not views that are correct. The paper assumes that selection for patience correlates with selection for altruism, but there's no reason views couldn't be patient AND selfish, or patient AND systematically mistaken about ethics. Over cosmological timescales, even tiny selection coefficients favoring self-propagating (rather than correct) moral views would drive out correctly-motivated actors. The concrete consequence is that the "long views win" dynamic the paper tentatively endorses is actually a mechanism for value drift away from correct views toward views optimized for propagation.
