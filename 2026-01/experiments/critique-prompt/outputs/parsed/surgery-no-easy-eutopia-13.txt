> The threat from "wrong" population ethics shrinks dramatically if plausible views mostly converge on practical recommendations at cosmic scales, making the theoretical disagreements less action-relevant than the paper assumes.

The paper's population ethics examples suffer from **parameter sensitivity** regarding what views future civilizations will actually hold. The paper argues that getting population ethics "wrong" could cause massive value loss—but this only matters if there's a fact of the matter about population ethics and civilizations are likely to miss it. If population ethics is genuinely indeterminate or if the differences between plausible views wash out at cosmic scales (because all plausible views agree that more flourishing is better within some broad range), then "mistaken population ethics" becomes far less threatening. The paper treats the space of population ethics views as if each leads to radically different recommendations, but the practically relevant disagreements might be much narrower than the theoretically possible ones.
