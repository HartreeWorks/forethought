[The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper assumes that "coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes" could meaningfully steer civilization toward eutopia, but ignores that any actor with the capability to influence resource allocation at cosmic scales faces overwhelming incentives to defect from cooperative value-maximization. Consider the "initial periods of settlement and resource appropriation" the paper mentions—whoever controls the first self-replicating probes or AI systems that reach extrasolar resources has no credible commitment mechanism to share those resources according to any collectively agreed moral framework. The paper's own acknowledgment that resources might be "concentrated among a tiny number of hands" by "whoever was most-willing and most-able to grab them" is not merely one possible failure mode; it is the dominant equilibrium when first-mover advantages are astronomical and enforcement mechanisms are physically impossible across light-year distances. The consequence is that the paper's entire framework of "aiming" at eutopia assumes a coordination capacity that incentive structures will systematically destroy.
