> Many configurations can land in the fat tail, so hitting exceptional value-efficiency might be easy rather than hard if the tail is thick with diverse winners.

**Load-bearing claim:**
fat-tailed distributions of value-efficiency across resource uses make linear views fussy

**Attack type:**
Causal reversal

The paper argues that because value-efficiency is fat-tailed, most resource uses capture only a small fraction of maximum value. But the same evidence—that outcomes vary enormously in value-efficiency—could support the opposite conclusion: that there are many different configurations in the fat tail, not just one. If 1% of configurations capture 90% of maximum value (as in many fat-tailed distributions), and that 1% represents billions of distinct possible arrangements given cosmic resources, then hitting "something in the tail" becomes easy rather than hard. The paper assumes a single optimal configuration, but fat-tailed distributions often have thick tails precisely because many different approaches can achieve exceptional outcomes through different mechanisms.
