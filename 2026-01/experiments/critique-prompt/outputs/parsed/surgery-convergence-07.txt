> If suffering and flourishing scale asymmetrically with technology—suffering being harder to sustain at scale—then threats become too costly to execute, making them self-limiting rather than value-destroying.

**Load-bearing claim 3 (Value-destroying threats could rob trade scenarios of most value)** — *Countermodel*: The paper warns that even small fractions of resources devoted to executed threats could destroy most value, especially on negative-leaning views. But consider a world where the capacity to generate extreme suffering and the capacity to generate extreme flourishing scale differently with technology. If suffering requires specific computational architectures that are difficult to maintain at scale, while flourishing-producing systems are more robust and easier to replicate, then threat execution becomes increasingly expensive relative to value creation. In such a world, the equilibrium would involve credible threats but almost no executed threats, because execution costs exceed the coercive benefits. The paper's threat analysis assumes symmetric scaling of goods and bads creation, but this assumption may fail, making threats self-limiting rather than value-destroying.
