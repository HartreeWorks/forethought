"The Externality Blindspot" challenges the paper's framing of trade as occurring between agents with different moral views who control separable resource shares. Real moral trade, the paper assumes, involves discrete parties agreeing to exchanges. But many of the most important moral questions concern externalities—effects on parties who aren't at the bargaining table. Digital minds that could be created, future generations, animals, and potential persons have no resources with which to trade. The paper's trade framework systematically ignores these constituencies, but the "narrow target" of a mostly-great future presumably includes getting their interests right. Trade between existing powerful parties provides no mechanism for representing these interests unless some traders happen to care about them—bringing us back to the convergence problem the paper already deemed unlikely. The trade framework is thus far less general than the paper suggests.
