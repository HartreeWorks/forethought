> If superintelligence makes contracts perfectly enforceable as the paper claims, then executed threats should drop to near zero, since threats only fire when commitments fail.

**Load-bearing claim 3 (Value-destroying threats could rob trade scenarios of most value)** — *Parameter sensitivity*: The paper treats the fraction of resources devoted to executed threats as an independent variable, but this fraction is itself determined by the enforceability of contracts and credibility of commitments—parameters the paper acknowledges will be radically different with superintelligent assistance enabling "iron-clad contracts." If contracts become perfectly enforceable, executed threats should approach zero: threats only execute when commitments fail, and perfect enforcement means commitments don't fail. The paper simultaneously claims superintelligence enables reliable trade infrastructure and that threats remain a major risk, but these exist in tension. The critique is that threat-risk and contract-enforcement aren't independent parameters—they're tightly coupled, and the paper's optimism about one should propagate to the other.
