[The Historical Parallelist] The paper's optimism about "moral trade" in section 3 parallels 19th-century liberal optimism about free trade preventing war—the belief that economic interdependence would make conflict irrational and therefore unlikely. That belief was tested and falsified by World War I, where deeply economically integrated European powers chose war despite massive mutual losses, because considerations of honor, security, and domestic politics dominated economic rationality. Similarly, the paper assumes that groups with different values will recognize and capture gains from moral trade, but history suggests that ideological groups frequently reject mutually beneficial arrangements when accepting them would signal weakness or compromise sacred values. The concrete consequence is that the paper's estimates of realized gains from moral trade should be revised dramatically downward based on the historical track record of ideologically-motivated actors rejecting positive-sum arrangements.
