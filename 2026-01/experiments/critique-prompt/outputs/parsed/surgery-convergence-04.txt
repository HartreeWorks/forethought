> Strategic misrepresentation unravels the whole framework: if groups know moral trade will allocate cosmic resources, they'll exaggerate or fabricate extreme preferences to grab a larger share, collapsing the gains from trade.

**Load-bearing claim 2 (Trade and compromise can achieve mostly-great futures only under specific axiological conditions)** — *Equilibrium shift*: The paper analyzes moral trade assuming relatively static bargaining positions, but strategic actors would adapt. If groups anticipate that moral trade will determine cosmic resource allocation, they have strong incentives to misrepresent their values—claiming to hold linear, non-discounting views even if they don't, to maximize their share before bargaining. Groups might also strategically adopt "harder to satisfy" values precisely because such values command larger resource transfers in trade. This could trigger an arms race of increasingly extreme stated preferences, collapsing the gains from trade the paper relies on. The paper assumes moral trade operates on genuine preferences, but game-theoretic considerations suggest stated preferences would become strategically constructed, fundamentally undermining the optimistic trade scenarios.
