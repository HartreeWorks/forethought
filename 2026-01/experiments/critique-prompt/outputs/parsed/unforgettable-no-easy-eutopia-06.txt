"The Bounds Bootstrap" attacks the paper's treatment of bounded versus unbounded views. The paper argues bounded views are fussy because they become approximately linear over humanity's small contribution to universal value. But this assumes we should evaluate humanity's contribution relative to universal value rather than relative to accessible value. If bounded views care about diminishing returns within what we can affect, then the curvature kicks in precisely where it matters. The paper's argument requires bounded theorists to adopt a particular cosmological reference frame that they have no reason to accept. A bounded theorist could simply define their bounds over the accessible universe, escaping the linearization argument entirely.
