"The Extinction Anchor Problem" targets the paper's definition of value where extinction is stipulated at 0. The entire argument about how far common-sense utopia falls short depends on this anchoring—but why should extinction serve as the natural zero point rather than, say, the expected value of a random accessible future? If we anchor differently, the ratios change dramatically. The paper claims this follows from von Neumann-Morgenstern representation, but the representation theorem only gives uniqueness up to positive affine transformation, meaning the choice of zero is arbitrary and doing substantial argumentative work the authors don't acknowledge. The paper would need to justify this specific anchoring or show its conclusions are robust to alternative anchors.
