The paper discusses "blockers" to good futures in section 2.5 but treats them as discrete failure modes rather than analyzing the system's overall reliability. Any system that must avoid multiple independent failure modes over cosmological timescales will have vanishingly low overall reliability unless it has redundancy and graceful degradation properties. The paper identifies at least five major blockers (extinction, evolutionary dynamics, memetic hazards, early lock-in, and unknown unknowns) but never asks what happens when the system must avoid all of them simultaneously over millions of years. If each blocker has even a 1% per-century failure rate, the compound probability of avoiding all blockers over a million years approaches zero. The concrete consequence is that the paper's conditional probability estimates ("given survival" and "given reasonably good conditions") hide the actual probability of reaching mostly-great futures, which must account for the compound reliability of avoiding all blockers.
