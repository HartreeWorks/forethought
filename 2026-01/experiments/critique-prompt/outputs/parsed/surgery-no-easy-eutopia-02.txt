**Load-bearing claim:**
The paper's first load-bearing claim about multiplicative value structure is further vulnerable

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

Consider a world where value is lexicographically ordered by first achieving some threshold of basic flourishing, after which additional dimensions contribute additively. In this model, once a civilization crosses the threshold (avoiding extinction, achieving basic material abundance), additional factors like "correct population ethics" or "optimal digital being treatment" add value but their absence doesn't multiply everything to near-zero. Many plausible moral frameworks work this way—Rawlsian justice prioritizes a threshold of primary goods before considering other dimensions, and most virtue ethics doesn't treat failure in one virtue as zeroing out all others. This countermodel shows that the multiplicative structure is assumed rather than argued for, yet it's doing most of the work in making eutopia appear difficult.
