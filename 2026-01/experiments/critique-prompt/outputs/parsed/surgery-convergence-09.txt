> If everyone loses from executed threats, rational actors would pre-invest in threat-prevention infrastructure, so the paper's threat scenarios describe an unstable disequilibrium rather than the likely outcome.

**Load-bearing claim 3 (Value-destroying threats could rob trade scenarios of most value)** — *Equilibrium shift*: The paper warns about value-destroying threats but doesn't model the second-order effects of anticipating such threats. If all parties know threats will destroy value, rational actors would invest heavily in threat-prevention infrastructure before resource allocation begins—analogous to how nuclear powers developed MAD doctrines and arms control before any nuclear exchange. The "state of nature" the paper describes would be unstable; the stable equilibrium includes whatever threat-prevention mechanisms are mutually beneficial to adopt. Since nearly all views lose from executed threats, nearly all views have incentives to create robust threat-prevention, suggesting the paper's threat-pessimism describes a disequilibrium scenario rather than the likely outcome. The relevant question isn't "what if threats occur?" but "what threat-prevention equilibrium emerges?"—and the paper doesn't adequately address this.
