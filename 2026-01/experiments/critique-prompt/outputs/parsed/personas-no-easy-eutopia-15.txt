The paper's discussion of space resource allocation and cosmic scale assumes that resources can be directed toward value-maximization with negligible transaction costs, but coordination across astronomical distances faces fundamental physical constraints that make such allocation practically impossible. The light-speed limit means that any governance system for extrasolar resources faces multi-year communication delays, making real-time coordination impossible and creating persistent information asymmetries. The paper notes that "20 billion galaxies in the affectable universe" would need to be used optimally for linear views to achieve eutopia, but provides no analysis of the coordination costs scaling with this scope. Furthermore, the paper assumes that "best feasible futures" are computationally identifiable—that we can actually determine which resource configurations maximize value—when this optimization problem is almost certainly intractable at cosmic scales. The consequence is that the paper's quantitative framework for evaluating futures ignores that the optimization it describes cannot be computed or implemented with any physically realizable governance system.
