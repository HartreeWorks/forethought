**Load-bearing claim 4 (Past moral progress doesn't reliably predict future convergence toward correct views)** — *Reference class failure*: The paper argues that the mechanism driving past moral progress (groups advocating for themselves) won't extend to future moral questions (chickens, digital minds, nonexistent people can't advocate). But this reference class is too narrow. Many historical moral advances came not from self-advocacy but from moral entrepreneurs: abolitionists weren't slaves, animal welfare advocates aren't animals, children's rights advocates weren't exclusively children. The relevant reference class isn't "self-advocacy" but "moral entrepreneurship on behalf of those who can't advocate." Since digital minds and future people will have human advocates with access to vastly superior persuasion tools (superintelligent rhetoric, immersive simulations of others' experiences), the mechanism for moral progress may actually strengthen rather than weaken. The paper's pessimism rests on a misidentified reference class.
