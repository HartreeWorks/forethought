"The Hedonic Treadmill Cuts Both Ways" undermines the paper's use of psychological evidence. The paper invokes treadmill effects to explain why eutopia seems closer than it is—but the same psychological mechanisms should make our current judgments that the future is far from eutopia equally suspect. If we systematically underestimate how far we are from ideal states, we might also systematically overestimate how specific our requirements are for satisfaction. The paper's own psychological argument suggests we cannot trust our intuitions about how fussy to be, yet the paper relies heavily on intuitions about what would constitute moral catastrophe. The argument would need some way to escape this self-undermining pattern.
