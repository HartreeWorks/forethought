"The Convergence Smuggle" identifies a hidden assumption in the paper's treatment of moral views. The paper lists many moral perspectives (religious, conservative, cosmopolitan, etc.) as each seeing current society as catastrophic, implying that satisfying any one view leaves others unsatisfied. But this treats these views as independent when many share deep structural features—most care about flourishing, suffering, autonomy, and meaning. A future optimized for these shared features might satisfy the core concerns of most views simultaneously, even if it fails on each view's distinctive requirements. The paper would need to defend the claim that the distinctive requirements, not the shared ones, are what matter for achieving most value.
