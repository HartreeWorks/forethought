[The Moral Parliament Dissenter] The paper's entire quantitative apparatus depends on von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory—complete orderings satisfying transitivity, continuity, and independence—but this framework systematically excludes moral views that reject these axioms. Deontological constraints often generate lexicographic preferences that violate continuity: some actions are simply impermissible regardless of consequences, and no probability weighting makes them acceptable. Virtue ethics centers character and practical wisdom rather than outcome optimization, rendering the entire "maximize expected value" framing category-mistaken. The paper briefly acknowledges that "not all reasonable moral views allow quantitative comparisons" but then proceeds as if this footnote absolved the analysis. The consequence is that the paper's conclusions about "fussy" versus "easygoing" views apply only within a consequentialist framework that many sophisticated moral traditions reject entirely, making its ostensibly ecumenical approach actually parochial.
