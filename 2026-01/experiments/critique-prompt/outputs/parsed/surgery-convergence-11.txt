> The paper's scepticism about moral progress is itself a product of historical positioning, so it can't selectively distrust optimism about convergence while exempting its own pessimistic framework.

**Load-bearing claim 4 (Past moral progress doesn't reliably predict future convergence toward correct views)** — *Causal reversal*: The paper suggests we can't infer future moral progress from past progress because we are biased—"our personal values are very significantly influenced by prevailing modern values, and it's trivial that values have historically trended toward modern values." But this argument cuts both ways: if our values are just products of our historical position, then so is our skepticism about moral progress. The argument that "moral progress is an illusion of perspective" is itself a product of a particular intellectual tradition that emerged historically. Either our historical position can generate genuine insights about moral progress, or it can't—but the paper selectively applies historical skepticism to optimistic claims while exempting its own pessimistic framework. If the critique holds, the paper's asymmetric skepticism is unjustified.
