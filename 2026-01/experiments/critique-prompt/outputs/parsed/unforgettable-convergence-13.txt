"The Will MacAskill Update Paradox" reveals a tension in the paper's own credibility. The authors note that Will revised his estimate of expected future value from <1% to 5-10% after exposure to these arguments. But the arguments in section 2 suggest that convergence is unlikely even among earnest reflectors with similar starting points. If Will's update is evidence that these arguments are compelling, it should also make us wonder why other thoughtful people haven't updated similarly—suggesting either the arguments aren't that compelling, or that even compelling arguments don't produce convergence. The paper can't use Will's update as evidence of the arguments' force while simultaneously arguing that compelling arguments won't produce convergence. Either the update is epistemically suspicious, or the pessimism about convergence is overstated.
