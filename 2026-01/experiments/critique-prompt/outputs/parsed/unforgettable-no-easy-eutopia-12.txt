"The Narrow View Nihilism" reveals that the paper's argument, if successful, undermines its own practical implications. If eutopia requires getting essentially everything right, and we have systematic uncertainty about what's right, then our expected impact on achieving eutopia is negligible regardless of what we do—we're almost certainly wrong about something crucial. But then the paper's implicit recommendation to work on "flourishing" rather than just "survival" loses force, since we have no reliable way to move toward the narrow target. The paper motivates concern about flourishing by showing the stakes are high, but simultaneously argues the target is so narrow that hitting it deliberately seems nearly impossible. The paper needs some account of how working on flourishing helps given radical uncertainty about the target.
