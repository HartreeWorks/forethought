> Our sense that "a tiny change shouldn't flip the verdict" breaks down at cosmic scales, where that "tiny change" is itself an entire stellar civilisation we can't intuitively grasp.

The joint-aggregation bounded view criticism also involves **reference class failure**. The paper's intuition pump about scale-tipping relies on our reactions to described scenarios, but our intuitions about cosmic-scale tradeoffs are poorly calibrated. We find it strange that "a tiny change to the relative balance of goods and bads shouldn't ever move the value of the future from as-good-as-extinction to eutopia"—but this strangeness might reflect our inability to intuitively grasp that the "tiny change" actually involves an entire common-sense utopia around a star. Our intuitions about proportionality were formed in contexts where we could actually comprehend the quantities involved. Using intuitive strangeness about cosmic-scale scenarios as evidence against a theory requires assuming our intuitions remain reliable in such contexts, which is itself a substantive and questionable assumption.
