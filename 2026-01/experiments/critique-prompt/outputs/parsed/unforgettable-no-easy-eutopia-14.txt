"The Experience Machine Reversal" turns the paper's wellbeing argument against itself. The paper argues that uncertainty about correct theories of wellbeing (hedonism vs. objective list vs. preference satisfaction) creates catastrophe risk. But the existence of this genuine uncertainty suggests that the "correct" theory might be one that doesn't distinguish sharply between these alternatives—perhaps what matters is some combination or none are fully correct. If moral reality doesn't carve at the joints the paper assumes, then futures that do reasonably well by all three theories might capture most of what matters. The paper's uncertainty argument assumes the true theory is one of the candidates when it might be none or a blend, which would make the target less narrow.
