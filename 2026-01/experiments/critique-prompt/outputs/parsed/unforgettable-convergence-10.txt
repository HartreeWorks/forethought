"The Meta-Ethical Confidence Problem" attacks the paper's practice of drawing conclusions by conditioning on different metaethical views. The authors argue that given realism, X follows; given antirealism, Y follows; therefore we should be pessimistic. But this inference pattern only works if our uncertainty across metaethical views is well-calibrated. If we're systematically overconfident in antirealism (perhaps because it's culturally dominant in academic philosophy), then the paper's pessimistic conclusions are driven by that miscalibration rather than by the object-level considerations. More fundamentally, the authors never justify treating metaethical uncertainty as irreducible—perhaps superintelligent reflection could resolve metaethical questions, in which case conditioning on both horns is premature. The paper needs an argument that metaethical uncertainty persists even under the "reasonably good conditions" they're analyzing.
