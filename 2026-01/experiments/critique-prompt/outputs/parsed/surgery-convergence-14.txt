> In a post-scarcity world, status competition could shift from wealth accumulation toward moral exemplarity, making self-interested behaviour look altruistic without any change in underlying motivation.

**Load-bearing claim 5 (Self-interest alone won't reliably produce mostly-great futures without explicit aim at the good de dicto)** — *Equilibrium shift*: The paper argues billionaires' low philanthropic rates show self-interest doesn't shift toward altruism even with diminishing returns. But current billionaires exist in an equilibrium where status competition emphasizes wealth accumulation and conspicuous consumption. In a post-scarcity world, status competition might shift dramatically—when everyone can have unlimited material goods, status might derive primarily from being seen as morally exemplary or benevolent. Historical status markers have shifted before (from martial prowess to wealth to cultural capital); a further shift toward moral status isn't implausible. If status competition equilibria shift in this direction, self-interested behavior would increasingly resemble altruistic behavior not because motivations change but because the social payoff matrix changes. The paper treats current billionaire behavior as indicative of future behavior while ignoring equilibrium dependence.
