"The Abundance Paradox" challenges the inference from diminishing marginal utility to increased altruistic spending in section 2.3.2. The authors acknowledge that billionaires today spend only ~6% of their income on philanthropy despite steeply diminishing returns to self-interested consumption, but then wave this away by noting that "more advanced technology provides greater scope to spend money in self-interested ways." This is precisely the problem: if self-interested preferences can always expand to absorb additional resources (through positional goods, copies of oneself, experiences of ownership, etc.), then there's no level of abundance at which altruistic preferences necessarily dominate. The authors have provided a mechanism for why altruistic spending *could* increase with abundance but simultaneously provided the counter-mechanism that explains why it *won't*. They need to argue that one mechanism dominates the other, which they haven't done.
