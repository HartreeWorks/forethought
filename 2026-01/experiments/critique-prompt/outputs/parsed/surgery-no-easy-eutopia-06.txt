The third load-bearing claim is that bounded difference-making views that aggregate goods and bads separately are fussy because even tiny quantities of bads prevent mostly-great futures. **Attack type: Countermodel.** The paper's calculation assumes that one star system's worth of bads in 10^22 star systems suffices to exceed 50% of the upper bound on disvalue. But this only follows if the bounded function approaches its upper bound extremely quickly. Consider instead a bounded function where approaching 50% of the upper bound requires something like 10^10 star systems of bads (still a tiny fraction of cosmic resources). In this countermodel, a civilization could have substantial imperfections—millions of star systems with net negative value—while still achieving a mostly-great future. The paper provides no justification for assuming the bound is approached so quickly that effectively zero bads are permissible.
