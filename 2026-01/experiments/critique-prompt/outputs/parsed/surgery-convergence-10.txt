**Load-bearing claim 4 (Past moral progress doesn't reliably predict future convergence toward correct views)** — *Countermodel*: The paper argues moral progress may reflect contingent historical forces (e.g., British power, WWII outcomes) rather than reliable truth-tracking. But construct a world where moral progress is indeed contingent in its specific path but convergent in its destination—like water finding its way downhill through different routes depending on terrain. In this world, had Germany won WWII, initial post-war values would differ, but over centuries they would converge toward the same endpoint because the arguments for certain views are simply stronger. The paper conflates path-contingency with outcome-contingency, but these can come apart: the specific route of moral progress can be historically contingent while the eventual destination remains determined by the strength of moral arguments. If this critique holds, the paper's dismissal of moral progress as evidence for convergence is too quick.
