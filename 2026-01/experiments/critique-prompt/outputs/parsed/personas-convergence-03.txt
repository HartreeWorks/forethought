The paper repeatedly invokes "trade," "compromise," and "bargaining" as mechanisms that could enable mostly-great futures without specifying any actual protocol for how such trades would be structured, verified, or enforced across cosmological timescales and between parties with radically different ontologies. Section 3.1 waves toward "iron-clad contracts" enabled by superintelligence without addressing how contract terms would be specified when the parties disagree about what states of the world count as fulfilling the contract, or how enforcement would work when the enforcer's values could drift. The failure mode is that "moral trade" in this paper functions as a magic box: resources go in, coordinated outcomes come out, but the actual mechanism remains unspecified. Without formal specification of the state space, the verification procedures, and the enforcement mechanisms, the claimed gains from trade are computationally meaningless—you cannot prove efficiency properties about a protocol you haven't defined.
