**Load-bearing claim 1 (Moral convergence under good conditions is unlikely given antirealism)** — *Countermodel*: The paper argues that under antirealism, different subjective idealizing processes will diverge because there are too many "free parameters" in ethics. However, consider a world where antirealism is true but the space of stable reflective equilibria is actually quite small due to coherence constraints—most combinations of ethical parameters generate internal contradictions when pushed to their limits, and the remaining stable configurations cluster tightly. In such a world, different idealizing processes would converge not because of objective moral facts but because of structural constraints on coherent value systems, similar to how different mathematicians converge on the same theorems despite mathematics being arguably constructed. If this critique holds, the paper's central argument against WAM-convergence under antirealism loses much of its force, and the probability assigned to reaching mostly-great futures should increase substantially.
