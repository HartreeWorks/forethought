[The Historical Parallelist] The paper's argument that moral catastrophes are "the norm across history" is deployed to support pessimism about achieving eutopia, but the same historical evidence shows that confident assertions about moral truth—exactly what the paper's framework requires for deliberate optimization—have repeatedly produced the catastrophes in question. The religious persecution, slavery, and subjugation the authors list were not accidents of moral uncertainty; they were confident applications of moral frameworks their adherents believed were correct. The 20th century's greatest moral catastrophes—from colonialism to totalitarianism—were perpetrated by actors who believed they had solved the questions the paper raises: correct population ethics (eugenics), proper social organization (communism, fascism), civilization's appropriate resource allocation (lebensraum). The consequence is that the paper's call for deliberate optimization toward identified best outcomes echoes the exact epistemic posture that historically enabled catastrophe, suggesting the framework is not merely insufficient but actively dangerous.
