"The Intertheoretic Escape Hatch" challenges the paper's claim that moral uncertainty makes things worse. The paper argues that aggregating across views remains fussy, but this assumes we should aggregate by taking expectations. An alternative approach—satisficing across views, aiming for outcomes that clear some threshold on most views—could be far more achievable. The paper dismisses joint-aggregation bounded views as implausible, but a satisficing approach could inherit joint aggregation's easygoingness without its "scale-tipping" problems. The paper treats expected value maximization across views as the only serious approach to moral uncertainty, which is itself a highly contested assumption. The paper's fussiness conclusion depends on this methodological choice.
