The paper models moral convergence and trade as if the relevant dynamics occur between a manageable number of discrete actors with stable preferences, but a post-AGI world would likely feature emergent dynamics between billions or trillions of interacting agents, sub-agents, copies, and forks whose aggregate behavior cannot be predicted from individual-level analysis. Section 3.2's discussion of "resource-compatible" views and "hybrid goods" assumes that compatibility is a property that can be assessed pairwise and then aggregated, but in high-dimensional systems with many interacting values, small incompatibilities can cascade into large-scale coordination failures through nonlinear dynamics. The failure mode is that even if each bilateral moral trade looks positive-sum, the system of all trades could exhibit emergent instabilities—cycles, races to the bottom, or phase transitions—that destroy value in ways no individual actor intended or could predict. The paper provides no analysis of these systemic risks.
