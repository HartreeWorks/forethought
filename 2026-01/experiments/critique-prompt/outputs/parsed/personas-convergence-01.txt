[The Empirical Hardliner] The paper's central claim that "widespread, accurate, and motivational convergence" (WAM-convergence) is unlikely rests on untested assertions about how reflection processes diverge from different starting points, illustrated by the "random walk" diagram in section 2.2.1. Yet the authors provide no empirical data on how actual moral views change under extended reflection, no measurement of the variance in reflective endpoints among people with similar versus different starting intuitions, and no falsifiable prediction about what distribution of post-reflection views we should expect. The failure mode here is that the entire argument against convergence could be wrong if reflection turns out to be more like gradient descent toward attractors than random walks—but without specified conditions under which the authors would update toward convergence, this remains unfalsifiable speculation dressed as analysis. The concrete consequence is that the paper's pessimistic probability estimates (5-10% of potential value) are ungrounded, and policy recommendations derived from them could be systematically miscalibrated.
