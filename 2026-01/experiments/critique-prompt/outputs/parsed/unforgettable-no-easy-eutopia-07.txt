"The Digital Being Dilemma" exposes how the paper's argument proves too much. The paper treats uncertainty about digital welfare as a risk of moral catastrophe. But this uncertainty exists now—we don't know if current AI systems have morally relevant experiences. If mere uncertainty about welfare creates catastrophic risk, then current society is already in moral catastrophe for different reasons than the paper acknowledges, and the "survival" baseline the paper uses is already deeply negative. This would collapse the paper's framework where survival is the denominator against which flourishing is measured. The paper cannot simultaneously treat digital welfare uncertainty as a future catastrophe and treat current survival as a meaningful positive baseline.
