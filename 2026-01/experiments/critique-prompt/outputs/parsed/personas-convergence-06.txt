[The Second-Order Catastrophist] Suppose the paper's preferred scenario succeeds: partial AM-convergence occurs among a meaningful minority, trade mechanisms work, and threats are somehow contained. The paper never examines what happens when this coalition of the morally convergent successfully captures most of the universe's resources for "flourishing." The failure mode is that any successful mechanism for coordinating toward "correct" values across diverse actors creates selection pressure for value-systems that are better at capturing that coordination mechanism. If moral trade favors patient, non-discounting, scope-sensitive values, then memetic variants of those values that include subtle distortions—perhaps valuing simulated suffering for "completeness," or valuing quantity over quality in ways the original traders wouldn't endorse—could outcompete the original values within the winning coalition. The concrete consequence is that the very success of moral coordination mechanisms creates an attractor for sophisticated value-system parasites that the paper's framework cannot detect or prevent.
