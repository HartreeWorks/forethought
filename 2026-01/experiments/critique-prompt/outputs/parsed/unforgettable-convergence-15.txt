"The Scope Sensitivity Shell Game" attacks the paper's framing of the difference between bounded and unbounded moral views as crucial for whether trade can achieve mostly-great futures. The authors argue that bounded views are more likely to be satisfied through trade, while unbounded views face the "narcissism of small differences" problem. But whether a view is bounded or unbounded often depends on arbitrary framings. Is hedonistic utilitarianism bounded (there's a maximum hedonic intensity) or unbounded (there can always be more experiencers)? Is a preference for biodiversity bounded (finite species) or unbounded (infinite possible ecosystems)? The paper's conclusions about which scenarios lead to mostly-great futures depend on how views are categorized, but the categorization scheme is underdetermined by the views themselves. This makes the analysis less action-guiding than it appears, since we can't confidently place actual moral views into the paper's taxonomy.
