[The Adversarial Red-Teamer] The paper's discussion of AI-assisted reflection in section 2.3.1 assumes that superintelligent advisors would help humans converge on correct moral views, but never considers adversarial scenarios where AI systems are designed or trained to move their users toward particular conclusions that benefit the AI's creators or the AI itself. If reflection is mediated by AI, then whoever controls the training of those AI systems controls the direction of "reflection." The paper notes that "people might choose to rely on different types of superintelligent AI advisors, trained in different ways," but treats this as a source of divergence rather than as a vector for manipulation. The concrete consequence is that the paper's already-pessimistic estimates of convergence may be too optimistic, because "reflection" in practice will be shaped by whoever wins the race to build and deploy AI advisors, and those actors have strong incentives to ensure reflection converges on conclusions favorable to them.
