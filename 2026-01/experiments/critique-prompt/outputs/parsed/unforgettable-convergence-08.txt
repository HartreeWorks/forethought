"The Hybrid Goods Illusion" attacks the paper's reliance on the possibility that two views can be "resource-compatible" through creating "hybrid goods" that satisfy both. The paper offers the example of hedonists and objective list theorists agreeing to create beings that are both blissful and wise. But this assumes that hybrid goods are nearly as efficient at producing value-per-resource as optimized goods would be for each view separately. If being maximally blissful requires cognitive architectures incompatible with wisdom, or vice versa, then the "hybrid" represents a substantial discount for both parties. The paper offers no argument that hybrid goods don't involve such discounts—and given the "narrow target" premise, we should expect that optimal states for different views are highly particular and non-overlapping. The hybrid goods concept may be mostly empty.
