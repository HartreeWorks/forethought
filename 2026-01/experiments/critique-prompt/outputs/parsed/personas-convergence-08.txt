The paper's entire framework assumes that there exists a "correct moral view" such that futures can be ranked by their proximity to what this view endorses, and that this view is sufficiently determinate to distinguish "mostly-great" futures from alternatives. But the paper never defends this assumption against moral particularism, according to which there may be no single correct ranking of futures—only contextual judgments that cannot be aggregated into a cosmic ordering. Section 2.4 tries to hedge between realism and anti-realism, but the paper's key claims about "losing most value" and "narrow targets" require cardinal comparisons of value across radically different possible futures, which particularists would reject as category errors. The concrete consequence is that the paper's quantitative estimates (5-10% of potential value) are not merely uncertain but potentially meaningless if the aggregation operation they presuppose is philosophically illicit.
