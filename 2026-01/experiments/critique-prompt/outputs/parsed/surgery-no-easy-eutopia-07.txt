> Whether a bounded value function seems "fussy" depends entirely on its asymmetry—slow approach to the disvalue bound could actually make the view quite permissive, but the paper treats this parameterisation as fixed.

The separate-aggregation bounded view argument faces **parameter sensitivity** regarding the shape of the bounding function. The paper assumes the disvalue function is symmetric or nearly symmetric in its rate of approaching bounds, but many plausible bounded functions are highly asymmetric in their derivatives. A function that approaches its upper bound for goods slowly but approaches its bound for bads quickly would be fussy in the paper's sense, but a function with the opposite properties—slow approach to the disvalue bound—would permit substantial bads without catastrophic value loss. The paper treats the specific parameterization of the bounding function as given rather than as a critical variable that determines whether the view is fussy or easygoing.
