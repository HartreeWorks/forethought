"The Narcissism Boomerang" targets the paper's argument that resource-compatible views could achieve hybrid goods through trade. The authors introduce the "narcissism of small differences" concept to explain why superficially similar views might have smaller gains from trade—Annie and Bob both care about worship but can't compromise on which deity. But this principle, properly generalized, undermines the entire optimistic case for moral trade. The views most likely to engage in earnest moral trade are precisely those that take morality seriously and have strong convictions about what matters—and such views are exactly the ones most likely to exhibit narcissism of small differences with each other. Meanwhile, views that are genuinely resource-compatible (one cares about wisdom, another about bliss) are probably held by people with such different psychological profiles that they're unlikely to be trading partners in the first place. The paper needs a principled account of which view-pairs are both resource-compatible AND plausible trading partners.
