[The Capability Accelerationist] The paper treats the question of who shapes the future as if it were primarily determined by moral and philosophical factors—convergence, trade, reflection—while ignoring that capability differentials will dominate. Section 2.3 discusses superintelligent advice as if all parties would have equal access to such advice and equal ability to act on it, but in reality, whichever actor first achieves decisive capability advantages will shape the future regardless of whether broader convergence has occurred. The authors' entire framework of "partial AM-convergence plus trade" presupposes a multipolar situation where trade is possible, but if capability development is uneven, we should expect unipolar outcomes where the leader's values (converged or not) simply win. The concrete consequence is that the paper's recommendations implicitly assume a window for philosophical reflection and institutional design that capability dynamics may close before it can be utilized.
