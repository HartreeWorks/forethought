"The Common-Sense Utopia Escape Hatch" targets the paper's recurring reference to "common-sense utopia" as a state where common-sense ethical views get most of what they want. The paper uses this concept to suggest that even if WAM-convergence fails, perhaps most people converging on common-sense views would be good enough. But "common-sense ethical views" is doing enormous unacknowledged work here. Common sense in 1800 endorsed slavery; common sense in 1950 endorsed racial segregation; common sense today may endorse factory farming. The paper provides no argument that common-sense views after superintelligent reflection would be better rather than worse than common-sense views today, especially if (as the paper suggests) memetic pressures, social conformity, and selection effects shape which views become "common sense." This escape hatch may lead to a mostly-terrible future that feels fine to its inhabitants.
