"The Reflection Lottery" attacks the paper's central inference that partial AM-convergence plus trade could yield a mostly-great future because different people with different starting preferences would converge sufficiently through reflection. The paper assumes that among the minority who do reflect earnestly on the good de dicto, there will be enough overlap in their conclusions to enable mutually beneficial trade. But if reflection is genuinely open-ended and the target is genuinely narrow (as the authors themselves argue), then even the small fraction of altruistically-motivated reflectors will scatter across the vast space of possible moral conclusions like lottery balls. The paper cannot simultaneously maintain that (a) the target is so narrow that widespread convergence is unlikely, and (b) the minority who do engage in reflection will cluster tightly enough around correct views to control meaningful resource shares. If this objection holds, the authors would need to either abandon the "narrow target" framing that motivates their entire project, or provide a mechanism for why altruistic reflectors specifically would converge when others wouldn't.
