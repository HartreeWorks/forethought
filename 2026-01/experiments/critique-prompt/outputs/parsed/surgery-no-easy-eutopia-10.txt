The fifth load-bearing claim is that linear unbounded views require both using almost all resources AND putting them toward very specific uses, making the target narrow. **Attack type: Countermodel.** The paper argues that separability plus fat-tailed value-efficiency means "unless most available resources are configured for almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing... most achievable value is almost certainly lost." But consider a universe where the "most valuable configuration" is one that maximizes diversity of valuable experiences. On such a view, a civilization that spreads across 20 billion galaxies with enormous internal variation—some optimized for bliss, others for achievement, others for connection—could be exactly what the linear view recommends. The paper assumes the optimal configuration must be homogeneous replication of a single "value-efficient" arrangement, but linear separable views are compatible with optimal configurations that are inherently diverse, which would make the target much broader.
