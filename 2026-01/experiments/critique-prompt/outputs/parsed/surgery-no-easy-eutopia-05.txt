The claim about fat-tailed value-efficiency distributions also faces **quantitative cliff** concerns. The paper's reasoning assumes that the fat-tail property of earthly distributions (wealth, city size, intervention effectiveness) will persist at cosmic scales, but this extrapolation may break down. At sufficiently large scales, there may be hard physical limits on value-efficiency (thermodynamic constraints on computation supporting consciousness, for instance), creating effective upper bounds that compress the distribution. The ratio between "exceptional" and "typical" value-efficiency might be enormous at human scales but converge at cosmic scales. If the distribution becomes less fat-tailed as scale increases—because physically optimal solutions become more constrained—then the argument that most of the probability mass misses most of the value no longer holds.
