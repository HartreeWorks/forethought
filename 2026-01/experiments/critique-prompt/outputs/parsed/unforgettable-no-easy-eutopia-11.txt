"The Moral Progress Paradox" identifies a self-undermining element in the paper's historical argument. The paper uses past moral catastrophes (slavery, animal farming) to argue future catastrophes are likely. But recognizing past catastrophes requires moral progress—we now see what was wrong. If moral progress is real and continuing, the argument for ongoing catastrophes weakens over time. The paper needs both that we've made enough progress to identify past errors and that we won't make enough progress to avoid future errors. This requires a specific claim about where moral progress saturates that the paper doesn't provide. The paper would need to explain why moral progress was sufficient to reveal historical catastrophes but insufficient to prevent future ones.
