"The Multiplicative Mirage" attacks the paper's inference that value being a product of independent factors implies most futures are far from eutopia. The paper assumes these factors are independently distributed, but in any realistic future, the factors are deeply correlated—societies that get digital welfare right are more likely to get population ethics right because both stem from similar moral reasoning capacities and institutional structures. If factors are positively correlated, the product distribution shifts dramatically rightward, making mostly-great futures far more common than the toy model suggests. The paper would need to defend the independence assumption with empirical evidence about how moral progress actually works across domains, which would require a substantially different argumentative strategy.
