[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Section 3.3 acknowledges that threats could undermine moral trade but dramatically underestimates the problem by treating threat-making as an optional strategy some actors might pursue. The paper fails to recognize that in any equilibrium where non-threatening actors control significant resources, threatening actors gain massive leverage precisely because the non-threatening actors' revealed unwillingness to make threats becomes exploitable. The authors' hope that "some kind of legal system which reliably prevents value-undermining threats would be mutually agreeable and stable" ignores that actors with comparative advantage in credible threat-making have no incentive to agree to such a system, and actors who would benefit from such a system reveal their threat-aversion by proposing it. The concrete consequence is that the paper's optimistic scenarios about partial AM-convergence plus trade systematically overestimate the resources that correctly-motivated actors will retain after equilibrium threat dynamics play out.
