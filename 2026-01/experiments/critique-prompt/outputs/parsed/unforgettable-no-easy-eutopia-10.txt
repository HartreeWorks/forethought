"The Resources Red Herring" attacks the paper's claim that linear views require using "most accessible resources." The paper argues that achieving 50% of best feasible value requires controlling most of the accessible universe. But this assumes value scales linearly with resources at all scales, when the paper's own examples (Russell's ecstasy, Dostoevsky's epileptic experiences) suggest that some small-scale arrangements might achieve extraordinary value density. If the best use of resources is intensely concentrated rather than evenly spread, then a civilization controlling a tiny fraction of resources but using them optimally might achieve most feasible value. The paper's linearization argument undermines its scale argument.
