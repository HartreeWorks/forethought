> If rational agents understand the scale-tipping property, they'd simply avoid threshold-adjacent gambles, so the supposedly absurd scenario never arises in practice—it's a feature, not a bug.

**Load-bearing claim:**
joint-aggregation bounded views, while potentially easygoing, suffer from fatal "scale-tipping" problems

**Attack type:**
Equilibrium shift

The paper argues that these views are implausible because adding a tiny common-sense utopia to a massive balance of goods and bads could tip the scales from worse-than-extinction to eutopia. But if agents know this property of value, they would never construct scenarios where outcomes teeter at the scale-tipping threshold—strategic actors would either stay well within comfortable margins or recognize that threshold-adjacent gambles are decision-theoretically unstable. In a world where powerful actors understand this property of value, the "strange" scale-tipping scenarios would never arise in practice, because building massive compensating quantities of goods and bads while ignoring the balance would be irrational. The argument treats the counterintuitive implication as a reductio, but it might instead be a feature that shapes rational behavior.
