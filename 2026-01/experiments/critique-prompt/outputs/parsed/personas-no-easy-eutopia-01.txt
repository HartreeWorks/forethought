The paper's central claim that value is "multiplicative" across independent factors—such that a single flaw can eliminate most potential value—is asserted without any identified causal mechanism explaining why moral value should decompose this way rather than additively or through some other aggregation function. The authors offer the toy model where value equals the product of N uniformly distributed factors, but provide no empirical evidence that moral value actually behaves this way, nor any falsifiable prediction that would distinguish multiplicative from additive models. The analogy to fat-tailed distributions of wealth and health outcomes conflates instrumental goods with intrinsic moral value without justification. If this multiplicative structure is wrong, the entire quantitative framing collapses—the 99.99th percentile "best feasible future" threshold, the 50% "mostly-great" cutoff, and the claim that even futures scoring highly "on average" across factors still miss most value all depend on this undefended functional form. The consequence is that the paper's core argument rests on a mathematical convenience rather than a demonstrated feature of moral reality.
