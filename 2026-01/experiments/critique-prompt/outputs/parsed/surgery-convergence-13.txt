> Competitive dynamics might force even self-interested actors toward creating flourishing digital minds, much like markets force efficiency—making good outcomes a strategic byproduct rather than requiring explicit moral aim.

**Load-bearing claim 5 (Self-interest alone won't reliably produce mostly-great futures without explicit aim at the good de dicto)** — *Countermodel*: The paper argues self-interested motivation is insufficient because people might create bad lives (digital servants), fail to create enough good lives, or neglect non-individual goods like nature. But consider a world where the optimization target of "flourishing digital minds" becomes instrumentally valuable for nearly all goals—because happy workers are more productive, because maintaining unhappy servants is a security risk, because social status depends on being seen to treat one's digital creations well. In such a world, competitive dynamics would force even self-interested actors toward creating flourishing, similar to how market competition forces firms toward efficiency even absent intrinsic concern for efficiency. If competitive dynamics at cosmic scales select for flourishing-creation as a strategy, self-interest could produce mostly-great futures as a byproduct.
