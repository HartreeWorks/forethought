> Perhaps nearly all achievable value sits within reach of recognisably human minds, making the "alien experiences" gap negligible rather than the large chasm the paper assumes without evidence.

**Load-bearing claim 5 (Self-interest alone won't reliably produce mostly-great futures without explicit aim at the good de dicto)** — *Quantitative cliff*: The paper acknowledges that "meta-ethical hedonism" combined with welfarism might allow self-interest to produce good outcomes, but dismisses this because "the very best experiences are so alien that most people initially pursuing their self-interest cannot themselves experience them." This assumes a continuous gradient from current human experiences to optimal experiences. But there may be a quantitative cliff: perhaps 99% of achievable value is accessible to minds recognizable as continuous with current humans, with only the remaining 1% requiring alien transformation. If the value function is concave in "alienness" in this way, self-interested humans could capture nearly all achievable value while remaining recognizably human. The paper treats the gap between human-accessible value and maximum possible value as potentially large, but this is an empirical assumption about the shape of the value landscape that receives no defense.
