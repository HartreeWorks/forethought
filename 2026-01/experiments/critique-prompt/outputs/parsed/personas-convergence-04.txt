The paper's discussion of "blockers" in section 2.5 treats regulatory capture and institutional decay as edge cases rather than as the default trajectory of any governance system operating over the timescales the authors consider. The authors assume that if "reasonably good conditions" are achieved, reflection and bargaining can proceed toward mostly-great outcomes, but they never examine how the institutions enabling those "good conditions" would resist capture by concentrated interests over thousands or millions of years. Historical evidence suggests that every institution designed to preserve particular values—from constitutional republics to religious orders—eventually gets captured, hollowed out, or repurposed by actors with different objectives. The concrete consequence is that even if the paper's optimistic scenarios about convergence and trade were otherwise correct, the institutions required to maintain "reasonably good conditions" would predictably fail before the relevant reflection and bargaining could complete, making the entire analysis conditional on an unstated and implausible assumption of institutional durability.
