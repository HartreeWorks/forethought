The paper assumes that correct moral views, once identified, could be stably maintained across cosmic timescales, but selection pressures will systematically erode any configuration that is not self-reinforcing. Consider the paper's concern about "wrong discount rate"—civilizations that discount the future will expand faster than those that don't, eventually dominating the resource base regardless of which discount rate is "correct." The same logic applies to population ethics: views that favor more reproduction will outcompete views favoring fewer, higher-welfare lives. The paper acknowledges that "values could become unmoored from human values, drifting into worthlessness," but treats this as an avoidable risk rather than an evolutionary inevitability. Any eutopian configuration that is not also an evolutionarily stable strategy will be invaded by variants that sacrifice value for competitive advantage. The consequence is that the paper's entire framework ignores that the "target" isn't stationary—selection will reshape what configurations are achievable, making eutopia a moving target that recedes under competitive dynamics.
