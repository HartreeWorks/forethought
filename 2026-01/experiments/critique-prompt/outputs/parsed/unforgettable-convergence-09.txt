"The Random Walk Cuts Both Ways" targets the paper's use of the random walk analogy in section 2.2.1, where moral reflection is visualized as walks that diverge from a shared origin. The authors argue that current agreement is misleading because people haven't walked far yet, and further reflection will cause divergence. But random walks are symmetric in time: if we don't know which direction is "correct," the random walk analogy provides no reason to think current positions are *worse* than future positions will be. The analogy only supports pessimism if you assume current positions are better than chance and reflection adds noise. But if current positions are worse than chance (perhaps due to evolutionary biases), reflection could cause convergence. The authors' use of this analogy depends on an unstated assumption about the current quality of moral beliefs that they haven't defended.
