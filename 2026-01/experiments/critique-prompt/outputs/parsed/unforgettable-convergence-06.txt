"The Selection Pressure Reversal" attacks the argument in section 2.3.3 that "long views win" through asymmetric growth. The authors suggest that patient, non-discounting altruistic values might come to dominate through differential savings and fertility. But the same selection logic that favors patience could favor patience in service of *any* goal, including goals antithetical to the good. A patient sadist or a patient power-seeker benefits from the same selection pressures as a patient altruist. Moreover, the selection pressure for non-discounting values is also a selection pressure for values that are *good at spreading themselves*, which may be orthogonal or opposed to values that are *correct*. The paper's own logic suggests that what wins out is memetic fitness, not moral accuracy. If this objection holds, the "long views win" consideration should actually increase pessimism.
