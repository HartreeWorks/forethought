**Load-bearing claim:**
value should be understood as the product of many independent factors, such that failure on any single dimension causes massive value loss

**Attack type:**
Reference class failure

The multiplicative model is illustrated by analogy to wealth distribution and individual wellbeing, but these domains may transfer poorly. Wealth is multiplicative largely due to specific institutional features (compound returns, network effects in markets), and individual wellbeing factors interact in complex, often substitutive ways (people with chronic pain can achieve high wellbeing through other channels). The paper provides no argument that cosmic-scale moral value should follow the same mathematical structure as these contingent human-scale phenomena. If moral value is instead additive, threshold-based, or exhibits diminishing returns across factors rather than multiplicative collapse, then "single flaws" wouldn't erase most value, and the paper's central quantitative claims about narrow targets collapse entirely.
