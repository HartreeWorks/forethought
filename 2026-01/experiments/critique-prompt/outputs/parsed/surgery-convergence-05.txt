> At cosmic scales, even tiny design incompatibilities between value systems make hybrid compromises catastrophically wasteful for both sides, turning apparent resource-compatibility into mutual suboptimality.

**Load-bearing claim 2 (Trade and compromise can achieve mostly-great futures only under specific axiological conditions)** — *Quantitative cliff*: The paper suggests trade works well when views are "resource-compatible" and can pursue "hybrid goods," but this logic inverts at scale. At small scales, hybrid goods provide mutual gains because neither party has saturated their preferences. At cosmic scales with linear preferences, even tiny incompatibilities become catastrophic. If View A wants maximally efficient hedonium and View B wants maximally efficient preference-satisfaction-substrate, and these optima diverge by even 0.1% in design specifications, then at cosmic scale, devoting resources to any "hybrid" means both parties lose astronomical amounts of value compared to pure optimization. The paper treats resource-compatibility as a binary or spectrum, but there's a cliff: below certain scales, hybrid goods yield gains; above it, they become mutually assured suboptimality. Given cosmic stakes, we're definitionally above this cliff.
