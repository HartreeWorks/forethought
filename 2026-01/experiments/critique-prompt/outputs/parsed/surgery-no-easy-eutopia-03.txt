The multiplicative value model faces a **parameter sensitivity** problem regarding the number of "factors" and their independence. The paper treats the number of morally relevant factors as fixed and treats these factors as independent, but both parameters are contentious. If factors are correlated (e.g., getting digital welfare right correlates strongly with getting population ethics right, because both require similar epistemic and moral capacities), then the probability of hitting a mostly-great future is much higher than the model suggests. Conversely, if one can always subdivide factors into finer distinctions (is "correct treatment of digital beings" one factor or fifty?), the number N is arbitrary and can be tuned to produce any desired conclusion. The paper's quantitative example with N=5 factors producing expected value of 0.03 would change dramatically under different assumptions about factor count and correlation structure.
