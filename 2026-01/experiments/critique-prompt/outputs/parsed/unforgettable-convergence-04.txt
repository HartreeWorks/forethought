"The Motivational Gap Cannot Close" challenges the paper's central move of treating "reasonably good conditions" as achievable while separately analyzing what happens under such conditions. The authors define reasonably good conditions as having "no major blockers" and then proceed to analyze convergence assuming we reach them. But the paper's own arguments about why WAM-convergence is unlikely apply equally to convergence on what counts as "reasonably good conditions" in the first place. If people won't converge on correct moral views even with superintelligent assistance, they certainly won't converge on the institutional arrangements, decision-making procedures, and enforcement mechanisms that would constitute "reasonably good conditions." The analysis is thus question-begging: it assumes we can coordinate on the prerequisites for coordination while arguing we can't coordinate on the outcomes.
