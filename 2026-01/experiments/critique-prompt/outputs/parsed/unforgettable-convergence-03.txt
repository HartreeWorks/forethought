"The Threat Asymmetry Trap" attacks the inference that preventing value-destroying threats would make trade scenarios much more optimistic. The paper argues that if threats can be prevented, "it's just on the linear views that we don't reach a mostly-great future via compromise and trade." But the capacity to prevent threats requires enforcement mechanisms, and enforcement mechanisms themselves create new threat vectors. Any system powerful enough to prevent Alice from threatening to harm animals unless Bob pays her is also powerful enough to be captured by whichever coalition controls it, who can then use that enforcement capacity to extract concessions from others. The paper treats threat-prevention as a clean intervention, but the authors have given no reason to think the cure isn't worse than the disease—especially since, by their own logic, whoever controls enforcement would face the same lack of convergence pressures as everyone else.
