The paper treats the "factors" determining future value as "relatively independent," enabling its multiplicative model, but complex adaptive systems generate emergent properties and feedback loops that make such independence assumptions catastrophically wrong. Consider the paper's own examples: digital being welfare interacts with population ethics (more digital beings changes optimal population calculations), which interacts with space resource allocation (different populations require different resources), which feeds back to digital welfare (resource constraints affect what kinds of beings are created). The paper's toy model with N independent uniform distributions ignores that actual civilizational choices are embedded in path-dependent historical processes where early decisions constrain later option spaces in unpredictable ways. The authors acknowledge they "should expect that this list is very far from exhaustive" but don't recognize that incompleteness in a complex system isn't merely missing items—it's missing the interaction effects that dominate actual outcomes. The consequence is that the paper's quantitative framework produces precise-seeming conclusions from a model that fundamentally misrepresents how civilizational value actually emerges.
