[The Resource Economist] The paper's optimistic scenarios about moral trade in section 3 assume that the resources of the accessible universe are large enough to satisfy multiple demanding moral views simultaneously, but never actually estimates the resource requirements of different views or the total resources available. If the "correct moral view" is unbounded and linear in resources (as section 3.2 suggests it might be), then even the entire accessible universe represents a finite and potentially inadequate resource pool. The paper gestures at "hybrid goods" that could satisfy multiple views efficiently, but provides no analysis of whether such hybrids exist for the specific views under consideration, or what efficiency losses occur when they don't. The concrete consequence is that the paper's framework of "gains from moral trade" presupposes a resource abundance that may not exist, and the actual analysis of whether trade can reach mostly-great outcomes requires quantitative resource accounting the paper doesn't provide.
