[The Mechanism Designer] The paper repeatedly invokes "society" making decisions about digital being welfare, space resource allocation, and population ethics, but never specifies the mechanism by which these collective choices would be made or enforced. When the authors write that "society's political systems might not allow those views to win out in face of a majority (or empowered minority) that opposes them," they acknowledge the problem but offer no formal specification of what alternative institutional design could overcome it. The sailing metaphor—with its "navigation systems" and "reconnaissance boats"—is pure analogy without any corresponding protocol. What voting rule aggregates preferences over incompatible population ethics? What property rights regime governs the first asteroid miners? What court enforces digital being rights against their human owners? Without these mechanisms specified precisely enough to analyze their equilibria and failure modes, the paper's framework for "reaching a near-best future" is not a proposal but a wish. The consequence is that readers cannot evaluate whether eutopia is achievable because there is no specified path to evaluate.
