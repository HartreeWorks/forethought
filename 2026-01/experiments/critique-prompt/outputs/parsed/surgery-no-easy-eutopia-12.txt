> Past moral catastrophes happened under scarcity and limited reflection time, so they're a misleading reference class for predicting moral failures in post-scarcity civilizations with far greater resources for ethical deliberation.

The paper's treatment of ongoing moral catastrophes as evidence for future fragility commits **reference class failure**. The paper lists historical moral catastrophes (slavery, subjugation) and contemporary candidates (factory farming, abortion depending on one's view) to argue that "single flaws" easily undermine value. But historical moral catastrophes occurred under conditions of scarcity, limited information, and lack of moral reflection time that may not characterize post-scarcity advanced civilizations. The reference class of "moral errors made by resource-constrained human societies with limited deliberation" may not transfer to "moral errors made by civilizations with vastly more resources for ethical reflection, experimentation, and course-correction." If moral progress is real and correlated with resources available for reflection, the historical reference class overstates the probability of future moral catastrophe.
