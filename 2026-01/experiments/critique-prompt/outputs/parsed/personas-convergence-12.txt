[The Cognitive Scientist] Section 2.3.1's discussion of superintelligent reflection assumes that human preferences are coherent enough to be "idealized" through extended reflection, but decades of research on preference construction, framing effects, and context-dependence suggests that human preferences are not stable objects waiting to be discovered but are constructed in the moment of elicitation. The paper treats "what you would prefer after millions of years of reflection" as if this refers to a determinate fact, but if preferences are constructed rather than revealed, then "extended reflection" would construct new preferences rather than discover pre-existing ones, and there's no principled reason to privilege preferences constructed through one reflection process over another. The concrete consequence is that the paper's framework of "converging toward correct values through reflection" may be built on a folk-psychological model of preferences that cognitive science has shown to be false.
