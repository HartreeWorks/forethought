**Load-bearing claim 1 (Moral convergence under good conditions is unlikely given antirealism)** — *Parameter sensitivity*: The paper treats "distance from current human preferences" to "correct moral view" as roughly fixed across metaethical positions, but this parameter could vary enormously depending on which specific antirealist theory obtains. On some constructivist views, the correct moral view is constituted by idealized human agreement, which means the "distance" is definitionally bounded by human psychology. On error theory, there is no correct view at all, making "distance" undefined. On relativism, there may be multiple equally correct views, some very close to human preferences. The paper's argument requires that antirealism implies high variance in reflective outcomes, but some antirealist theories actually constrain variance more tightly than realism would (since realism permits the true moral facts to be arbitrarily alien). If this parameter varies as suggested, the paper's pessimism about antirealist convergence is overconfident.
