> Our current inability to articulate a plausible easygoing moral view might just mean we haven't made the conceptual breakthroughs yet, not that such views are impossible—history shows "impossible" metaethical positions get developed all the time.

The argument that moral views are unlikely to become more easygoing after reflection faces **causal reversal**. The paper suggests that because we can't currently specify an easygoing view that's also plausible, further reflection won't help. But the inability to currently specify such a view is weak evidence about what reflection would yield—it might instead indicate that easygoing views require conceptual innovations we haven't yet made. Historical precedent shows that metaethical positions once thought impossible (like error theories that remained action-guiding, or non-cognitivist views that accommodated moral reasoning) were later developed. The same evidence—current inability to articulate easygoing views—could indicate either that such views don't exist or that we haven't yet discovered how to articulate them.
