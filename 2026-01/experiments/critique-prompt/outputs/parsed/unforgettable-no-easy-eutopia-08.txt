"The Common-Sense Utopia Trap" reveals that the paper's key example undermines its own argument. The paper stipulates that common-sense utopia involves "minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings"—but this is already loading in the correct answer to several of the supposedly difficult questions. If achieving common-sense utopia requires solving animal welfare and digital welfare, then it's not a baseline against which fussiness is measured but rather a demanding achievement. The paper needs common-sense utopia to seem easily achievable to make fussiness surprising, but describes it in terms that already require solving hard problems. The paper would need to define a genuinely minimal baseline that doesn't presuppose solutions to its own catastrophe examples.
