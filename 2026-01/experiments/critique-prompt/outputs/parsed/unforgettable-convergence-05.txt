"The Realism-Antirealism Squeeze" targets the paper's argument structure in section 2.4, which claims pessimism follows on both horns of the realism/antirealism dilemma. The authors argue that given realism, correct views are probably alien and unmotivating; given antirealism, there's no convergence target. But this framing hides a third possibility the authors don't adequately address: that the correct metaethical view is some form of constructivism where convergence is possible precisely because the "correct" view is partly constituted by what reflective agents would converge on. On such views, the question isn't whether agents converge on some mind-independent truth, but whether the convergence process itself is well-structured. The paper dismisses "objectively correct idealizing processes" as inconsistent with antirealism's motivations, but constructivism isn't antirealism—it's a view on which correctness is real but convergence-dependent. If constructivism is true, the entire argument structure collapses.
