**Load-bearing claim 2 (Trade and compromise can achieve mostly-great futures only under specific axiological conditions)** — *Reference class failure*: The paper draws on trade analogies (coin collectors, bird-freeing) and economic reasoning to suggest moral trade would yield large mutual gains. But the reference class of trades where both parties have roughly commensurate alternatives and can walk away doesn't transfer to cosmic-scale moral trade. In ordinary trade, outside options bound exploitation. In cosmic moral trade, if your view controls 0.001% of resources and another view controls 99.9%, your "outside option" (keeping your resources) yields cosmically negligible value, giving you essentially no bargaining power. The paper assumes trade dynamics resemble ordinary markets, but they may more closely resemble hostage negotiations—where asymmetric stakes lead to highly unequal outcomes regardless of theoretical efficiency gains.
