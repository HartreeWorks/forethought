The paper's framework for analyzing bounded vs. unbounded views exhibits **quantitative cliff** problems at the boundary between "approximately linear" and "meaningfully sublinear" regimes. The paper argues that bounded views are approximately linear if the bound is far from humanity's achievable impact, but this depends critically on empirical claims about cosmic scale that are deeply uncertain. If the universe is smaller than assumed, or if humanity's potential cosmic impact is larger than assumed, or if there are fewer alien civilizations than assumed, then bounded views might be meaningfully sublinear rather than approximately linear. The paper's central taxonomy—and the conclusion that most bounded views are fussy—depends on empirical cosmological assumptions being correct, but our uncertainty about cosmology is sufficient that we should have substantial credence that the framework's boundary conditions don't hold.
