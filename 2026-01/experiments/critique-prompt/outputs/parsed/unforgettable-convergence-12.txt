"The Lock-In Timing Problem" attacks the paper's deferred discussion of lock-in as a "blocker" while proceeding to analyze scenarios assuming no lock-in. The authors acknowledge that early lock-in could make it "impossible for later generations to produce a mostly-great future," but they structure their analysis as if lock-in considerations are independent of convergence considerations. They're not. If lock-in happens early (which is plausible given rapid AI development), then the only convergence that matters is convergence among early decision-makers, who will by construction have had less time for reflection than the paper's analysis assumes. The paper's optimistic scenarios all depend on eventually reaching good conditions, but lock-in means "eventually" might never come. This isn't an additional blocker to consider separately—it undermines the entire analytical framework.
