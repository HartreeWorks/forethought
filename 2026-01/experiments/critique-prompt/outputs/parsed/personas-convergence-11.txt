[The Political Economist] The paper's discussion of who will control resources in section 3.2 treats the distribution of power as roughly exogenous to the moral views held by different actors, but in reality, certain moral views are systematically associated with greater power accumulation. Views that endorse ruthless competition, exploitation of commons, and defection from cooperative arrangements tend to concentrate power precisely because they are unconstrained by the moral considerations that limit other actors. The paper asks whether "the correct moral view" will control enough resources to trade effectively, but never addresses the systematic tendency for power to flow toward views that are incorrect by the paper's own implicit standards. The concrete consequence is that the paper's scenarios where "correctly-motivated actors" retain meaningful resource shares are selection-biased: they condition on an outcome (correct views retaining power) that the dynamics of power accumulation actively select against.
