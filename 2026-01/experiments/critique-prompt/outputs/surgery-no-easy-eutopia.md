1. The paper's first load-bearing claim is that value should be understood as the product of many independent factors, such that failure on any single dimension causes massive value loss. **Attack type: Reference class failure.** The multiplicative model is illustrated by analogy to wealth distribution and individual wellbeing, but these domains may transfer poorly. Wealth is multiplicative largely due to specific institutional features (compound returns, network effects in markets), and individual wellbeing factors interact in complex, often substitutive ways (people with chronic pain can achieve high wellbeing through other channels). The paper provides no argument that cosmic-scale moral value should follow the same mathematical structure as these contingent human-scale phenomena. If moral value is instead additive, threshold-based, or exhibits diminishing returns across factors rather than multiplicative collapse, then "single flaws" wouldn't erase most value, and the paper's central quantitative claims about narrow targets collapse entirely.

2. The paper's first load-bearing claim about multiplicative value structure is further vulnerable. **Attack type: Countermodel.** Consider a world where value is lexicographically ordered by first achieving some threshold of basic flourishing, after which additional dimensions contribute additively. In this model, once a civilization crosses the threshold (avoiding extinction, achieving basic material abundance), additional factors like "correct population ethics" or "optimal digital being treatment" add value but their absence doesn't multiply everything to near-zero. Many plausible moral frameworks work this way—Rawlsian justice prioritizes a threshold of primary goods before considering other dimensions, and most virtue ethics doesn't treat failure in one virtue as zeroing out all others. This countermodel shows that the multiplicative structure is assumed rather than argued for, yet it's doing most of the work in making eutopia appear difficult.

3. The multiplicative value model faces a **parameter sensitivity** problem regarding the number of "factors" and their independence. The paper treats the number of morally relevant factors as fixed and treats these factors as independent, but both parameters are contentious. If factors are correlated (e.g., getting digital welfare right correlates strongly with getting population ethics right, because both require similar epistemic and moral capacities), then the probability of hitting a mostly-great future is much higher than the model suggests. Conversely, if one can always subdivide factors into finer distinctions (is "correct treatment of digital beings" one factor or fifty?), the number N is arbitrary and can be tuned to produce any desired conclusion. The paper's quantitative example with N=5 factors producing expected value of 0.03 would change dramatically under different assumptions about factor count and correlation structure.

4. The second load-bearing claim is that fat-tailed distributions of value-efficiency across resource uses make linear views fussy. **Attack type: Causal reversal.** The paper argues that because value-efficiency is fat-tailed, most resource uses capture only a small fraction of maximum value. But the same evidence—that outcomes vary enormously in value-efficiency—could support the opposite conclusion: that there are many different configurations in the fat tail, not just one. If 1% of configurations capture 90% of maximum value (as in many fat-tailed distributions), and that 1% represents billions of distinct possible arrangements given cosmic resources, then hitting "something in the tail" becomes easy rather than hard. The paper assumes a single optimal configuration, but fat-tailed distributions often have thick tails precisely because many different approaches can achieve exceptional outcomes through different mechanisms.

5. The claim about fat-tailed value-efficiency distributions also faces **quantitative cliff** concerns. The paper's reasoning assumes that the fat-tail property of earthly distributions (wealth, city size, intervention effectiveness) will persist at cosmic scales, but this extrapolation may break down. At sufficiently large scales, there may be hard physical limits on value-efficiency (thermodynamic constraints on computation supporting consciousness, for instance), creating effective upper bounds that compress the distribution. The ratio between "exceptional" and "typical" value-efficiency might be enormous at human scales but converge at cosmic scales. If the distribution becomes less fat-tailed as scale increases—because physically optimal solutions become more constrained—then the argument that most of the probability mass misses most of the value no longer holds.

6. The third load-bearing claim is that bounded difference-making views that aggregate goods and bads separately are fussy because even tiny quantities of bads prevent mostly-great futures. **Attack type: Countermodel.** The paper's calculation assumes that one star system's worth of bads in 10^22 star systems suffices to exceed 50% of the upper bound on disvalue. But this only follows if the bounded function approaches its upper bound extremely quickly. Consider instead a bounded function where approaching 50% of the upper bound requires something like 10^10 star systems of bads (still a tiny fraction of cosmic resources). In this countermodel, a civilization could have substantial imperfections—millions of star systems with net negative value—while still achieving a mostly-great future. The paper provides no justification for assuming the bound is approached so quickly that effectively zero bads are permissible.

7. The separate-aggregation bounded view argument faces **parameter sensitivity** regarding the shape of the bounding function. The paper assumes the disvalue function is symmetric or nearly symmetric in its rate of approaching bounds, but many plausible bounded functions are highly asymmetric in their derivatives. A function that approaches its upper bound for goods slowly but approaches its bound for bads quickly would be fussy in the paper's sense, but a function with the opposite properties—slow approach to the disvalue bound—would permit substantial bads without catastrophic value loss. The paper treats the specific parameterization of the bounding function as given rather than as a critical variable that determines whether the view is fussy or easygoing.

8. The fourth load-bearing claim is that joint-aggregation bounded views, while potentially easygoing, suffer from fatal "scale-tipping" problems. **Attack type: Equilibrium shift.** The paper argues that these views are implausible because adding a tiny common-sense utopia to a massive balance of goods and bads could tip the scales from worse-than-extinction to eutopia. But if agents know this property of value, they would never construct scenarios where outcomes teeter at the scale-tipping threshold—strategic actors would either stay well within comfortable margins or recognize that threshold-adjacent gambles are decision-theoretically unstable. In a world where powerful actors understand this property of value, the "strange" scale-tipping scenarios would never arise in practice, because building massive compensating quantities of goods and bads while ignoring the balance would be irrational. The argument treats the counterintuitive implication as a reductio, but it might instead be a feature that shapes rational behavior.

9. The joint-aggregation bounded view criticism also involves **reference class failure**. The paper's intuition pump about scale-tipping relies on our reactions to described scenarios, but our intuitions about cosmic-scale tradeoffs are poorly calibrated. We find it strange that "a tiny change to the relative balance of goods and bads shouldn't ever move the value of the future from as-good-as-extinction to eutopia"—but this strangeness might reflect our inability to intuitively grasp that the "tiny change" actually involves an entire common-sense utopia around a star. Our intuitions about proportionality were formed in contexts where we could actually comprehend the quantities involved. Using intuitive strangeness about cosmic-scale scenarios as evidence against a theory requires assuming our intuitions remain reliable in such contexts, which is itself a substantive and questionable assumption.

10. The fifth load-bearing claim is that linear unbounded views require both using almost all resources AND putting them toward very specific uses, making the target narrow. **Attack type: Countermodel.** The paper argues that separability plus fat-tailed value-efficiency means "unless most available resources are configured for almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing... most achievable value is almost certainly lost." But consider a universe where the "most valuable configuration" is one that maximizes diversity of valuable experiences. On such a view, a civilization that spreads across 20 billion galaxies with enormous internal variation—some optimized for bliss, others for achievement, others for connection—could be exactly what the linear view recommends. The paper assumes the optimal configuration must be homogeneous replication of a single "value-efficient" arrangement, but linear separable views are compatible with optimal configurations that are inherently diverse, which would make the target much broader.

11. The unbounded linear view argument faces **equilibrium shift** problems regarding what future civilizations would actually do. The paper assumes that without "deliberate optimization towards" best outcomes, civilizations would fail to hit the narrow target. But advanced civilizations capable of spreading across galaxies would presumably also be capable of reasoning about value, and competitive dynamics might select for civilizations that effectively capture value. Just as market competition tends to discover efficient resource uses even without central planning, cosmic-scale civilizations might converge on high-value configurations through evolutionary or competitive mechanisms that don't require anyone to deliberately "optimize for value de dicto." If so, the conditional probability distribution used to define fussiness—outcomes "assuming no serious optimisation pressure"—describes a scenario that's cosmically unlikely to obtain.

12. The paper's treatment of ongoing moral catastrophes as evidence for future fragility commits **reference class failure**. The paper lists historical moral catastrophes (slavery, subjugation) and contemporary candidates (factory farming, abortion depending on one's view) to argue that "single flaws" easily undermine value. But historical moral catastrophes occurred under conditions of scarcity, limited information, and lack of moral reflection time that may not characterize post-scarcity advanced civilizations. The reference class of "moral errors made by resource-constrained human societies with limited deliberation" may not transfer to "moral errors made by civilizations with vastly more resources for ethical reflection, experimentation, and course-correction." If moral progress is real and correlated with resources available for reflection, the historical reference class overstates the probability of future moral catastrophe.

13. The paper's population ethics examples suffer from **parameter sensitivity** regarding what views future civilizations will actually hold. The paper argues that getting population ethics "wrong" could cause massive value loss—but this only matters if there's a fact of the matter about population ethics and civilizations are likely to miss it. If population ethics is genuinely indeterminate or if the differences between plausible views wash out at cosmic scales (because all plausible views agree that more flourishing is better within some broad range), then "mistaken population ethics" becomes far less threatening. The paper treats the space of population ethics views as if each leads to radically different recommendations, but the practically relevant disagreements might be much narrower than the theoretically possible ones.

14. The argument that moral views are unlikely to become more easygoing after reflection faces **causal reversal**. The paper suggests that because we can't currently specify an easygoing view that's also plausible, further reflection won't help. But the inability to currently specify such a view is weak evidence about what reflection would yield—it might instead indicate that easygoing views require conceptual innovations we haven't yet made. Historical precedent shows that metaethical positions once thought impossible (like error theories that remained action-guiding, or non-cognitivist views that accommodated moral reasoning) were later developed. The same evidence—current inability to articulate easygoing views—could indicate either that such views don't exist or that we haven't yet discovered how to articulate them.

15. The paper's framework for analyzing bounded vs. unbounded views exhibits **quantitative cliff** problems at the boundary between "approximately linear" and "meaningfully sublinear" regimes. The paper argues that bounded views are approximately linear if the bound is far from humanity's achievable impact, but this depends critically on empirical claims about cosmic scale that are deeply uncertain. If the universe is smaller than assumed, or if humanity's potential cosmic impact is larger than assumed, or if there are fewer alien civilizations than assumed, then bounded views might be meaningfully sublinear rather than approximately linear. The paper's central taxonomy—and the conclusion that most bounded views are fussy—depends on empirical cosmological assumptions being correct, but our uncertainty about cosmology is sufficient that we should have substantial credence that the framework's boundary conditions don't hold.
