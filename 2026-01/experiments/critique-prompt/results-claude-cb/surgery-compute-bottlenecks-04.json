So its centrality to refuting the position is near zero, and it has essentially zero strength as a critique of the position. The claim is intelligible and focused (high clarity, single-issue, no filler), but it is largely an unsupported assertion (\u201cimplausibly low\u201d) rather than a demonstrated refutation; still, it\u2019s at least plausibly true, giving moderate correctness. Overall it poses little to no problem for the position.",
