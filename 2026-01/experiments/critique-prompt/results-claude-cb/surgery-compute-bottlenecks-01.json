Because it doesn\u2019t oppose any central premise or inference of the position, its centrality and refutational strength are effectively zero. The claim itself is reasonably plausible but asserted without argument or evidence, so correctness is moderate rather than high. It is very clear, contains no filler, and focuses on a single issue.",
