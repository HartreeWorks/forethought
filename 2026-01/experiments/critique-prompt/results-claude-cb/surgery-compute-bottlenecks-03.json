So its centrality-as-a-refutation is ~0 and it provides ~0 strength against the position. The claim itself is reasonably plausible (and consistent with cited economic discussion), though not established here, so correctness is moderate-high. It is clear, focused on a single issue, and contains no extraneous material.",
