1. [**The Empirical Hardliner**]
The paper’s entire argument for "eutopian fragility" rests on the unvalidated postulate that the value of the future is the *product* of independent factors ($V = \Pi x_i$) rather than a sum or a complex system with redundancy. In Section 2.4, the authors assert that scoring well on most factors but failing one leads to near-zero value, modeling social wellbeing like a delicate circuit board. Empirical data on human flourishing, however, suggests high substitutability; wealth compensates for health deficits, and social connection compensates for material poverty. By forcing a multiplicative model without historical or sociological evidence, the authors mathematically manufacture a "fragility" that likely does not exist, leading to a false conclusion that we must obsessively optimize every single variable to avoid catastrophe.

2. [**The Complexity Theorist**]
The central metaphor of "aiming" a ship at a specific "island" of value (Section 1) commits the fallacy of treating a complex adaptive system as a static optimization problem. In complex systems, "value" is an emergent property of interaction, not a pre-defined coordinate space we can navigate toward using linear vectors. The paper’s "Linear Unbounded" view (Section 3.2), which requires reconfiguring all resources for a specific "value-efficient" arrangement, would in reality trigger collapse; systems homogenized for single-variable maximization lack resilience and shatter under volatility. The consequence of "aiming" for this narrow peak is not eutopia, but system-wide ruin due to the removal of the slack and diversity required for survival.

3. [**The Political Economist**]
The attack on "easygoing liberalism" and "Common-sense utopia" (Section 2.2) functions as a rhetorical pretext for elite rent-seeking. By arguing that a future where everyone is happy, free, and abundant is actually a "moral catastrophe" because it fails to hit a theoretical 99.99th percentile target, the authors justify transferring power from democratic mechanisms (people choosing what they want) to technocratic "moral optimizers." This creates a principal-agent failure where a priestly caste defines the "narrow target" of value to align with their own ideological preferences, effectively stealing the future’s surplus under the guise of preventing "waste."

4. [**The Moral Parliament Dissenter**]
The paper’s handling of intertheoretic uncertainty (Section 3.5) constitutes a Pascal’s Mugging that destroys moral pluralism. By arguing that "Unbounded Linear Views" should loom largest because they posit the highest stakes (the difference between 0 and $\infty$), the authors allow a single fanatical framework to hijack the entire decision-making process. This logic implies we must sacrifice the certain flourishing of billions (the "bounded" views) to chase a speculative, astronomical payoff dictated by the most greedy utility function. The concrete consequence is a total disenfranchisement of human-scale values in favor of a "utility monster" theology.

5. [**The Second-Order Catastrophist**]
The paper’s thesis—that a "mostly-great" future is a failure mode—provides the intellectual ammunition for totalitarian atrocities. By characterizing a world of abundance and consent as potentially holding "near-zero value" (Section 2.3) due to obscure philosophical technicalities (like population ethics or digital rights), the authors lower the barrier for radical intervention. If a "good" world is actually "bad" relative to a theoretical maximum, then radical actors are justified in destroying a flourishing liberal civilization to gamble on a "perfect" one. This "perfect is the enemy of the good" logic is the exact mechanism behind historical utopian purges.

6. [**The Cognitive Scientist**]
The "Hedonic Treadmill" argument in Section 2.5 fundamentally misunderstands the nature of valuation. The authors treat the treadmill as a bias that hides the "true" absolute scale of value, but cognitive science suggests value is intrinsically relative and prediction-error based; there is no "view from nowhere." If future beings are satisfied and report high well-being, asserting they are in a "catastrophe" because they lack an "objective good" (Section 2.3.3) is a category error. Attempting to optimize for an objective metric that disconnects from the subjective experience of the agents involved leads to "wireheading"—creating a universe of high numbers that no mind actually enjoys.

7. [**The Mechanism Designer**]
The paper discusses "aiming" for a "best feasible future" but offers no formal specification for how this objective function could be verified or elicited. The critique of "difference-making bounded views" (Section 3.3) relies on abstract algebra about goods and bads ($v_b(g-b)$) without a mechanism to measure these units in a real-world context. Without a specified sensor or oracle to distinguish the "99.99th percentile" future from the "90th percentile" future, the proposal is computationally undecidable. A governance system built on this vagueness will inevitably drift, optimizing for proxy metrics (like GDP or computing cycles) that diverge from "true" value, resulting in Goodhart’s Law failures.

8. [**The Evolutionary Skeptic**]
The authors worry that the future might lock in "unreflective values" (Section 2.3.5), but they ignore that values are selected for their survival utility, not their philosophical purity. A "narrow target" morality that requires precise optimization is evolutionarily fragile; it will be outcompeted by "Common-sense utopia" or other "easygoing" systems which are likely more robust and reproductive. If the "best" future requires a fragile equilibrium that survival pressures naturally erode, then that future is not actually "feasible." The pursuit of this fragile eutopia distracts from the real imperative: reinforcing the evolutionary robustness of civilization against extinction.

9. [**The Resource Economist**]
The claim that "linear views" require almost all resources to be used for a specific end (Section 3.2) ignores the law of diminishing marginal utility. The paper posits a fat-tailed distribution of value-per-resource, assuming that the "best" use of matter is orders of magnitude better than the "second best." In reality, resource allocation is subject to congestion costs and saturation; the trillionth unit of "bliss" is worth less than the first. By modeling value as linear/unbounded, the paper advocates for a "winner-take-all" allocation strategy that misallocates capital toward hyper-specialized ends, destroying the diversification necessary for a stable economy.

10. [**The Institutional Corruptionist**]
The paper concludes that "society must have deliberately optimised" to hit the narrow target (Section 1). This assumes that the institutions created to perform this optimization will remain benevolent. In reality, any institution granted the power to steer humanity toward a specific "moral perfection" will be immediately captured by sociopaths or special interests who will redefine "eutopia" to mean "maximum power for the steering committee." The "No Easy Eutopia" thesis serves as a justification for indefinite emergency powers, ensuring that the "steering" mechanism becomes the primary source of the moral catastrophe it claims to prevent.
