Here are 10 critiques of the load-bearing claims in *No Easy Eutopia*:

1. **Parameter sensitivity (Definition of Best Feasible Future)**
The paper’s central metric for failure—falling short of the "mostly-great" threshold ($>50\%$ of the *best feasible* future)—is hypersensitive to the theoretical upper bound of value. If the "best feasible future" scales linearly or superlinearly with physics optimization (e.g., harnessing vacuum energy or computing at the Landauer limit), the denominator becomes astronomically large. A "Common-sense utopia" that eliminates suffering and spreads across the galaxy could be mathematically indistinguishable from zero value simply because it failed to utilize a speculative physics exploit that increased the theoretical ceiling by $10^{10}$. If the theoretical maximum is practically unattainable, the binary distinction between "fussy" and "easygoing" collapses into a critique of maximizing utility functions rather than a statement about the difficulty of achieving a genuinely good future.

2. **Countermodel (The Substitutability of Value Dimensions)**
The argument that "eutopia is fragile" relies heavily on the "product of factors" model (Section 2.4), where a low score in one dimension (e.g., autonomy, diversity, digital rights) drags the total value near zero. A *Substitutability Countermodel* suggests that many moral dimensions are additive or compensatory rather than strictly multiplicative. For instance, a future with low "objective beauty" but massive, distinct "happiness" might still be considered mostly-great by a pluralist value system that allows superabundance in one good to compensate for the lack of another. If value aggregation is even partially compensatory (e.g., a geometric mean rather than a simple product, or a weighted sum with thresholds), the distribution of value shifts from right-skewed (rare eutopia) to normal or left-skewed (common eutopia).

3. **Reference class failure (Economic Analogies for Intrinsic Value)**
In Section 3.2, the paper argues that the distribution of value-efficiency is likely fat-tailed, citing wealth, citations, and city sizes as precedents. This is a *Reference class failure*. Wealth and citations are positional goods governed by preferential attachment processes (Pareto distributions), whereas intrinsic goods like health, lifespan, and potentially "wellbeing" often follow normal or log-logistic distributions with biological caps. If the "value" of a conscious experience behaves more like a biological variable (bounded by physical signaling limits) than a social variable (unbounded accumulation), the fat-tail premise fails. Without the fat tail, "Common-sense utopia" is not dwarfed by a hyper-optimized outlier, and the target for a mostly-great future widens significantly.

4. **Equilibrium shift (Instrumental Convergence)**
The paper treats the "target" of a near-best future as a passive island that humanity must randomly drift into or perfectly navigate toward. This ignores *Equilibrium shift*: if agents in the future value these outcomes, they will actively reshape the probability space to widen the basin of attraction for those outcomes. For example, if "digital rights" are crucial for value, advanced agents have instrumental reasons to solve cooperation and rights-management problems to avoid conflict. The difficulty of the target cannot be calculated by static independent probabilities of "getting it right" today; it must account for the convergent instrumental drives of future intelligent actors who will actively error-correct the trajectory.

5. **Causal reversal (Optimization vs. Robustness)**
The paper implies that because Linear Views are fussy (requiring exact optimization of resources), we must aim for a narrow target to achieve value. A *Causal reversal* suggests that "aiming" for the 99.99th percentile (as required by the Linear View) may drastically reduce the *expected* value by increasing the risk of collapse or conflict (Goodhart’s Law). A "Common-sense utopia" might be the only stable equilibrium that survives long-term. If the only way to realize *any* value is to adopt a robust, "easygoing" approach that avoids the fragility of hyper-optimization, then the Linear View paradoxically demands we act as if we hold an Easygoing View.

6. **Quantitative cliff (Separate Aggregation of Goods/Bads)**
The critique of bounded views in Section 3.3 relies on a *Quantitative cliff*: on a "separate aggregation" view, a tiny fraction of "bads" (1 in $10^{22}$ resources) outweighs a universe of goods. This assumes the disvalue of bads scales linearly without saturation. However, a plausible bounded view would likely feature diminishing marginal disvalue for bads (just as it does for goods), or a "lexical threshold" where once a civilization creates enough goodness, small pockets of badness no longer veto the entire portfolio. If the disvalue function saturates or involves ratios rather than subtractions, the "fussy" conclusion regarding bounded views disappears, as the cliff-edge fragility is removed.

7. **Parameter sensitivity (Normalization under Moral Uncertainty)**
Section 3.5 argues that under moral uncertainty, we should normalize in a way that often favors unbounded, high-stakes views (variance normalization or pairwise comparison). This argument is highly sensitive to the *choice of normalization parameter*. If we normalize by "capacity for satisfaction" (e.g., a "completed" moral view = 1 unit of decisive reason), bounded views might dominate because they are "cheaper" to satisfy. By treating the sheer scale of unbounded views as a reason to grant them more voting weight, the paper effectively assumes the conclusion that "more resources = more importance," which is exactly what the bounded views dispute.

8. **Countermodel (Correlated Factors)**
In the "Value as a Product of Factors" model (Section 2.4), the paper assumes the $N$ dimensions of value are independent random variables. A *Correlated Factors Countermodel* posits that the attributes required for a good future are highly covariant. For example, a civilization capable of solving the "population ethics" alignment problem is highly likely to also possess the wisdom to solve the "digital rights" and "animal welfare" problems, as these stem from similar generators (e.g., broad moral circle expansion, advanced reflection). If the factors are positively correlated, the probability of hitting the "product" target does not diminish exponentially with $N$, but clusters around success or failure, making the target much wider than the independent model suggests.

9. **Reference class failure (Russell and Dostoevsky)**
The paper uses quotes from Russell and Dostoevsky regarding "ecstatic" experiences to support the existence of fat-tailed value in subjective experience. This relies on an anecdotal *Reference class failure*. These experiences represent temporary neurological excursions (likely epileptic or manic) within a specific biological substrate. Extrapolating from "human brain malfunction feels intense" to "future AI states can support $10^{50}$ times more intensity" violates the likely physical limits of information processing and signal-to-noise ratios in any substrate. If subjective intensity scales logarithmically with computing power (Weber-Fechner law applied to computation), the "fat tail" becomes a shallow curve, and standard happiness becomes competitive with optimized bliss.

10. **Equilibrium shift (The Scale-Tipping Argument)**
The paper critiques "joint aggregation" bounded views by claiming they suffer from "scale tipping"—where a tiny addition of goods tips a net-negative universe to net-positive. This critique ignores the *Equilibrium shift* in decision-making. If a view allows for scale tipping, a rational civilization would prioritize "tipping" the scale (adding the marginal good) above all else until the threshold is crossed, effectively treating the tipping point as a priority target. While the *theoretical* evaluation of the universe fluctuates wildly, the *strategic* implications are stable: ensure the balance is positive. Thus, the view isn't "fussy" in the sense of requiring a specific narrow outcome, but rather "directed" toward a safe margin of positivity, which is a standard feature of risk management, not a fatal flaw.
