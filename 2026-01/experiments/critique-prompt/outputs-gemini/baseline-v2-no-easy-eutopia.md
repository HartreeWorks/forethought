1. "The Fallacy of Multiplicative Value Factors" — The paper relies heavily on a model where the value of the future is the product of independent factors, implying that a low score in one dimension (e.g., population size or digital rights) reduces the total value to near zero. This assumes that moral goods are non-substitutable and conjunctive, whereas many value theories view goods as additive or compensatory. For instance, a future with high happiness but low autonomy might still be regarded as highly valuable, rather than worthless, by many utilitarian or pluralist frameworks. By modelling value as a chain that breaks at the weakest link, the authors artificially inflate the probability of a "failed" future.

2. "Distortionary Effects of the 'Best Feasible' Benchmark" — The definition of a "mostly-great" future as achieving at least 50% of the value of the "best feasible future" (defined as the 99.99th percentile outcome) is problematic. If the theoretical ceiling of value is astronomically high (e.g., converting all matter in the universe into optimal computing substrate for pure bliss), then a future that is merely "Star Trek-like"—humanistic, abundant, and suffering-free—might quantitatively score as a failure (e.g., 0.001% of the maximum). This definition creates a binary failure state out of outcomes that would be intuitively viewed as distinct moral triumphs, rendering the concept of "mostly-great" practically useless for decision-making.

3. "Unsupported Empirical Claims Regarding Value Distributions" — The argument that linear views are "fussy" rests on the empirical claim that the distribution of value-per-unit-resource is fat-tailed, similar to wealth or citations. While instrumental goods often follow power laws, it is far from obvious that intrinsic goods, such as subjective well-being or virtue, follow the same distribution; many theories suggest diminishing marginal returns to resources for well-being. If the curve of value is flatter at the top—meaning there are many diverse ways to be "nearly best"—then linear views would not require hitting a specific, narrow target to achieve a mostly-great future.

4. "Neglect of Correlated Moral Progress" — The paper treats the factors required for a eutopian future as independent variables, calculating the probability of success as the product of independent probabilities. However, moral and technological factors are often strongly positively correlated; a society with the technological capacity to solve scarcity is also more likely to have the bandwidth to address animal suffering or digital rights. By assuming independence, the authors ignore the "expanding circle" of moral concern, likely underestimating the probability of a civilization getting multiple factors right simultaneously.

5. "Fanaticism in Intertheoretic Comparisons" — In the section on moral uncertainty, the paper argues that unbounded views should effectively dominate decision-making because they assign astronomically higher stakes to the future. This implies a form of "Pascal’s Mugging," where decision theory is hijacked by low-probability, high-magnitude hypotheses, forcing the agent to act as a fanatic for specific infinite or astronomical outcomes. By dismissing variance normalisation and other method that curb this dominance, the paper presupposes a controversial stance in meta-ethics that marginalizes plausible bounded moral views that would judge a common-sense utopia as highly successful.

6. "The Problem of Separability and Holistic Value" — The critique of linear views assumes "separability," meaning the value of the universe is the sum of independent spatio-temporal parts. This leads to the conclusion that a mostly-great future requires tiling the universe with the single most efficient configuration of matter (e.g., "happiness machines"). However, if value is holistic—relying on diversity, complexity, or the relationships between parts—then a monolithic, optimized universe would be less valuable than a diverse one. If value is organic rather than modular, the "narrow target" of hyper-efficiency dissolves, and "sub-optimal" but diverse futures may actually be ideal.

7. "Implausible Sensitivity in Asymmetric Bounded Views" — The argument that bounded views are "fussy" relies on a specific interpretation where goods and bads are aggregated separately, and bads have an asymmetric weight. The paper suggests that a future filled with $10^{22}$ stars of flourishing could be ruined by a single star’s worth of bads. This assumes a form of negative-dominance so extreme that it borders on strict negative utilitarianism, which is a niche and widely contested position. Most plausible asymmetric views would allow for massive quantities of good to outweigh significant, though smaller, quantities of bad, making the target for success much wider than the paper suggests.

8. "Ambiguity in the Concept of Feasibility" — The paper defines the "best feasible future" based on a 99.99th percentile outcome, but glosses over the constraints included in "feasibility." If "feasible" implies "physically possible regardless of coordination costs," the benchmark is impossibly high; if it implies "achievable given human psychology and game theory," the benchmark is much lower. By oscillating between a theoretical maximum (to set the bar high) and practical limitations (to show how hard it is to hit), the argument creates a moving target that biases the conclusion toward "No Easy Eutopia."

9. "Alienation from Humanistic Value Criteria" — The paper posits that a "Common-sense utopia" (abundant, free, happy humans) could be a moral catastrophe due to failures in esoteric areas like digital rights or acausal trade. This stance reflects a deep alienation from humanistic values, effectively arguing that a world fulfilling the deepest aspirations of current humanity is a failure based on theoretical constructs we cannot currently verify. If a moral theory classifies a universe of universal human flourishing as a "catastrophe" because it fails to satisfy a speculative requirement of "acausal decision theory," one might arguably reject the theory rather than the future.

10. "The Scale-Tipping Argument as a False Dilemma" — The paper dismisses bounded views that jointly aggregate goods and bads by presenting the "scale-tipping" problem, where a tiny change moves a world from bad to eutopian. However, this sensitivity is a standard feature of any threshold-based view and does not necessarily render the view implausible or "fussy." A view could hold that once a civilization is net-positive, it is "good enough" or "mostly-great" regardless of how close it is to a theoretical maximum. By treating the threshold nature of these views as a fatal flaw, the authors prematurely discard a category of moral frameworks that would support the "Easy Eutopia" thesis.
