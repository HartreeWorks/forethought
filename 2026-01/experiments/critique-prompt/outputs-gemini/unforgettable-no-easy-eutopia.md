1. **"The Relativity Trap"**
The paper argues that a "mostly-great" future must achieve at least 50% of the value of a "best feasible future." This inference is flawed because it makes the definition of success parasitic on the theoretical maximum rather than the absolute quality of life. If technological capabilities expand the "best feasible" ceiling by a factor of 1,000 (e.g., through new physics or computing substrates), a "Common-sense Utopia" that was previously considered mostly-great suddenly becomes a "moral catastrophe" achieving only 0.1% of potential, despite the lived experience of its inhabitants remaining objectively identical. This breaks the inference that we should be despondent about common-sense outcomes; the paper may simply be measuring the expansion of the denominator (potential) rather than a failure of the numerator (actual flourishing). To fix this, the author needs to defend why *regret* over unactualized potential should weigh as heavily as actual suffering or lack of flourishing.

2.  **"The Disjunctive Defense"**
The paper argues that value is likely "multiplicative," modeled as the product of independent factors ($A \times B \times C...$), meaning a low score on one dimension (e.g., insufficient diversity) collapses the total value of the future. This inference relies on a specific, fragile ontology of value where goods are non-substitutable conditions of one another. However, many plausible moral views are additive or disjunctive: a world with massive happiness but low aesthetic beauty might still be 80% as good as the maximum, not 5% as good. If value factors are even partially substitutable, the paper’s mathematical demonstration of fragility (the $N$-dimensions graph) collapses. The author must demonstrate why moral goods function like links in a chain (weakest link determines strength) rather than ingredients in a meal (missing one ingredient doesn't ruin the calories).

3.  **"The Correlation Blind Spot"**
In Section 2.4, the paper models the future’s value as a product of $N$ variables sampled from *independent* uniform distributions. This mathematical model drives the conclusion that "mostly-great futures are rare," but it breaks the inference because the factors of a flourishing civilization are likely strongly positively correlated. A society capable of solving the coordination problems to achieve material abundance and eliminate suffering (factors A and B) is structurally much more likely to have the wisdom to solve issues of digital rights or population ethics (factors C and D). By treating these variables as independent coin flips, the paper artificially inflates the difficulty of the target. The argument needs to account for the covariance of civilizational competencies.

4.  **"The Fanatical Hijack"**
The paper argues in Section 3.5 that under moral uncertainty, we should weight "unbounded" (linear) views heavily because they perceive higher stakes (the difference between extinction and eutopia is vast). This argument is self-undermining because it allows the most "fussy" and fanatical theories to hijack the decision-making process simply by inflating their scale. If a bounded view says a future is "Great" and an unbounded view says it is "Mediocre relative to infinity," the paper’s aggregation method forces us to treat the future as mediocre. This acts as a "Pascal’s Mugging" of moral reasoning, where common-sense views are mathematically silenced by views that claim astronomical stakes. The author needs a defense against fanatical domination in intertheoretic aggregation.

5.  **"The Robustness of Slack"**
The paper infers that because "linear" views require hyper-efficient use of resources (fat tails), we must aim for a narrow target of specific resource configurations to achieve a mostly-great future. However, this creates a "Adversarial Exploit" vulnerability: systems hyper-optimized for specific value configurations are notoriously fragile to perturbations and Goodhart’s Law. A "Common-sense Utopia" that leaves resources unoptimized (slack) might be less valuable in a snapshot but far more robust over deep time than a hyper-fragile "maximally efficient" civilization. If longevity correlates with value, the "sub-optimal" slack-filled future may eventually accrue more total value than the fragile optimized one, reversing the paper's conclusion about which target we should aim for.

6.  **"The Instrumental Convergence of Eutopia"**
The paper contrasts "aiming for a narrow target" with "aiming for a big target" (Common-sense Utopia), arguing the former is necessary. This ignores the instrumental convergence of moral progress. A Common-sense Utopia—defined by freedom, abundance, and reflection—is arguably the *only* reliable mechanism for discovering and steering toward the "narrow target" of specific moral truth. We do not need to aim at the specific island (narrow target) from the start; we need to build a ship (broad target) capable of finding it. If the Common-sense Utopia is the launchpad for the Optimized Utopia, then the distinction collapses, and the "Easy Eutopia" view is reinstated as the correct instrumental strategy.

7.  **"The Dilution of Bads"**
In discussing bounded views (Section 3.3), the paper argues that if a view aggregates goods and bads separately, a tiny fraction of bads (e.g., 1 in $10^{22}$ stars) is sufficient to ruin the value of the future. This inference relies on the assumption that the *presence* of bads cancels out the *presence* of goods regardless of ratio. However, this violates strong intuitions about scale and dilution. If a civilization contains a trillion galaxies of pure bliss and one small room of suffering, labeling this a "moral catastrophe" or "worse than extinction" is a reductio ad absurdum of the moral view, not a condemnation of the future. The author needs to show why we should accept moral views that lack any sensitivity to the overwhelming ratio of good to bad.

8.  **"The Substrate Ceiling"**
The paper asserts that the distribution of value-per-resource is "fat-tailed" (linear unbounded views), meaning the best computers/minds are exponentially better than average ones. This ignores physical and information-theoretic limits. While *wealth* or *citations* may be fat-tailed, physical efficiency in computing and energy extraction is bounded by the Landauer limit and thermodynamic efficiency. We cannot exponentially improve the "conversion of matter to value" forever; eventually, we hit a hard substrate ceiling where the curve flattens. If the tail is truncated by physics, the gap between a "pretty good" use of resources and the "perfect" use shrinks, making Eutopia a broad plateau rather than a sharp peak.

9.  **"The Normative Boomerang of Fussiness"**
The paper defines "fussy" views—those that regard vast, happy, flourishing futures as failures—as "plausible." There is a hidden crux here: a moral theory that classifies a galaxy of happy beings as a tragedy because they aren't *maximally* happy is plausibly a defective moral theory. If a moral view demands a level of precision that makes the good the enemy of the perfect to such an extreme degree, the error likely lies in the theory, not in the difficulty of the future. By basing the argument on the plausibility of these hyper-demanding views, the author risks proving that "Moral Philosophy is broken" rather than "The Future is Hard."

10. **"The Paradox of Digital Rights"**
The paper cites "misguided attitudes to digital beings" as a key fragility, suggesting that failing to give AI rights could be catastrophic. However, this argument can be reversed: granting full rights to digital beings could be the catastrophe. If digital beings can be copied infinitely at near-zero cost, granting them equal voting/resource rights leads to the immediate disenfranchisement of all biological life and a total consumption of resources for digital reproduction (the "Repugnant Conclusion" via software). The "correct" moral view might actually require *not* granting full egalitarian rights to digital entities to preserve any other form of value. The paper assumes "more rights = better," but in a digital context, "rights" might simply mean "unconstrained replicator dominance."
