> Ecstatic experiences cited as evidence for fat-tailed value are likely just neural malfunctions, and if subjective intensity scales logarithmically with compute, the supposed fat tail flattens dramatically.

**Reference class failure (Russell and Dostoevsky)**
The paper uses quotes from Russell and Dostoevsky regarding "ecstatic" experiences to support the existence of fat-tailed value in subjective experience. This relies on an anecdotal *Reference class failure*. These experiences represent temporary neurological excursions (likely epileptic or manic) within a specific biological substrate. Extrapolating from "human brain malfunction feels intense" to "future AI states can support $10^{50}$ times more intensity" violates the likely physical limits of information processing and signal-to-noise ratios in any substrate. If subjective intensity scales logarithmically with computing power (Weber-Fechner law applied to computation), the "fat tail" becomes a shallow curve, and standard happiness becomes competitive with optimized bliss.
