The central metaphor of "aiming" a ship at a specific "island" of value (Section 1) commits the fallacy of treating a complex adaptive system as a static optimization problem. In complex systems, "value" is an emergent property of interaction, not a pre-defined coordinate space we can navigate toward using linear vectors. The paper’s "Linear Unbounded" view (Section 3.2), which requires reconfiguring all resources for a specific "value-efficient" arrangement, would in reality trigger collapse; systems homogenized for single-variable maximization lack resilience and shatter under volatility. The consequence of "aiming" for this narrow peak is not eutopia, but system-wide ruin due to the removal of the slack and diversity required for survival.
