> The relentless optimisation the Linear View demands may actually destroy expected value through fragility, making the Easygoing approach the only strategy that reliably delivers anything at all.

**Causal reversal (Optimization vs. Robustness)**
The paper implies that because Linear Views are fussy (requiring exact optimization of resources), we must aim for a narrow target to achieve value. A *Causal reversal* suggests that "aiming" for the 99.99th percentile (as required by the Linear View) may drastically reduce the *expected* value by increasing the risk of collapse or conflict (Goodhart’s Law). A "Common-sense utopia" might be the only stable equilibrium that survives long-term. If the only way to realize *any* value is to adopt a robust, "easygoing" approach that avoids the fragility of hyper-optimization, then the Linear View paradoxically demands we act as if we hold an Easygoing View.
