"Fanaticism in Intertheoretic Comparisons" — In the section on moral uncertainty, the paper argues that unbounded views should effectively dominate decision-making because they assign astronomically higher stakes to the future. This implies a form of "Pascal’s Mugging," where decision theory is hijacked by low-probability, high-magnitude hypotheses, forcing the agent to act as a fanatic for specific infinite or astronomical outcomes. By dismissing variance normalisation and other method that curb this dominance, the paper presupposes a controversial stance in meta-ethics that marginalizes plausible bounded moral views that would judge a common-sense utopia as highly successful.
