**"The Instrumental Convergence of Eutopia"**
The paper contrasts "aiming for a narrow target" with "aiming for a big target" (Common-sense Utopia), arguing the former is necessary. This ignores the instrumental convergence of moral progress. A Common-sense Utopia—defined by freedom, abundance, and reflection—is arguably the *only* reliable mechanism for discovering and steering toward the "narrow target" of specific moral truth. We do not need to aim at the specific island (narrow target) from the start; we need to build a ship (broad target) capable of finding it. If the Common-sense Utopia is the launchpad for the Optimized Utopia, then the distinction collapses, and the "Easy Eutopia" view is reinstated as the correct instrumental strategy.
