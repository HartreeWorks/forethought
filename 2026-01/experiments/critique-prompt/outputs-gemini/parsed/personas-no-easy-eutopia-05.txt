The paper’s thesis—that a "mostly-great" future is a failure mode—provides the intellectual ammunition for totalitarian atrocities. By characterizing a world of abundance and consent as potentially holding "near-zero value" (Section 2.3) due to obscure philosophical technicalities (like population ethics or digital rights), the authors lower the barrier for radical intervention. If a "good" world is actually "bad" relative to a theoretical maximum, then radical actors are justified in destroying a flourishing liberal civilization to gamble on a "perfect" one. This "perfect is the enemy of the good" logic is the exact mechanism behind historical utopian purges.
