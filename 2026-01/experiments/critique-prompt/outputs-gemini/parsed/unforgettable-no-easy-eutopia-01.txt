**"The Relativity Trap"**
The paper argues that a "mostly-great" future must achieve at least 50% of the value of a "best feasible future." This inference is flawed because it makes the definition of success parasitic on the theoretical maximum rather than the absolute quality of life. If technological capabilities expand the "best feasible" ceiling by a factor of 1,000 (e.g., through new physics or computing substrates), a "Common-sense Utopia" that was previously considered mostly-great suddenly becomes a "moral catastrophe" achieving only 0.1% of potential, despite the lived experience of its inhabitants remaining objectively identical. This breaks the inference that we should be despondent about common-sense outcomes; the paper may simply be measuring the expansion of the denominator (potential) rather than a failure of the numerator (actual flourishing). To fix this, the author needs to defend why *regret* over unactualized potential should weigh as heavily as actual suffering or lack of flourishing.
