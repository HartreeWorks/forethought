> A rational civilisation facing a tipping threshold would simply treat it as a priority target, making the view strategically stable rather than pathologically fussy.

**Equilibrium shift (The Scale-Tipping Argument)**
The paper critiques "joint aggregation" bounded views by claiming they suffer from "scale tipping"—where a tiny addition of goods tips a net-negative universe to net-positive. This critique ignores the *Equilibrium shift* in decision-making. If a view allows for scale tipping, a rational civilization would prioritize "tipping" the scale (adding the marginal good) above all else until the threshold is crossed, effectively treating the tipping point as a priority target. While the *theoretical* evaluation of the universe fluctuates wildly, the *strategic* implications are stable: ensure the balance is positive. Thus, the view isn't "fussy" in the sense of requiring a specific narrow outcome, but rather "directed" toward a safe margin of positivity, which is a standard feature of risk management, not a fatal flaw.
