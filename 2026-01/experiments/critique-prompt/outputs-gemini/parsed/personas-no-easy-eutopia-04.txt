[**The Moral Parliament Dissenter**]
The paper’s handling of intertheoretic uncertainty (Section 3.5) constitutes a Pascal’s Mugging that destroys moral pluralism. By arguing that "Unbounded Linear Views" should loom largest because they posit the highest stakes (the difference between 0 and $\infty$), the authors allow a single fanatical framework to hijack the entire decision-making process. This logic implies we must sacrifice the certain flourishing of billions (the "bounded" views) to chase a speculative, astronomical payoff dictated by the most greedy utility function. The concrete consequence is a total disenfranchisement of human-scale values in favor of a "utility monster" theology.
