**"The Fanatical Hijack"**
The paper argues in Section 3.5 that under moral uncertainty, we should weight "unbounded" (linear) views heavily because they perceive higher stakes (the difference between extinction and eutopia is vast). This argument is self-undermining because it allows the most "fussy" and fanatical theories to hijack the decision-making process simply by inflating their scale. If a bounded view says a future is "Great" and an unbounded view says it is "Mediocre relative to infinity," the paper’s aggregation method forces us to treat the future as mediocre. This acts as a "Pascal’s Mugging" of moral reasoning, where common-sense views are mathematically silenced by views that claim astronomical stakes. The author needs a defense against fanatical domination in intertheoretic aggregation.
