"The Scale-Tipping Argument as a False Dilemma" — The paper dismisses bounded views that jointly aggregate goods and bads by presenting the "scale-tipping" problem, where a tiny change moves a world from bad to eutopian. However, this sensitivity is a standard feature of any threshold-based view and does not necessarily render the view implausible or "fussy." A view could hold that once a civilization is net-positive, it is "good enough" or "mostly-great" regardless of how close it is to a theoretical maximum. By treating the threshold nature of these views as a fatal flaw, the authors prematurely discard a category of moral frameworks that would support the "Easy Eutopia" thesis.
