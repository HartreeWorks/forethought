> If value dimensions can compensate for each other rather than multiply, a shortfall in one area doesn't tank the whole future—making eutopia common rather than rare.

**Countermodel (The Substitutability of Value Dimensions)**
The argument that "eutopia is fragile" relies heavily on the "product of factors" model (Section 2.4), where a low score in one dimension (e.g., autonomy, diversity, digital rights) drags the total value near zero. A *Substitutability Countermodel* suggests that many moral dimensions are additive or compensatory rather than strictly multiplicative. For instance, a future with low "objective beauty" but massive, distinct "happiness" might still be considered mostly-great by a pluralist value system that allows superabundance in one good to compensate for the lack of another. If value aggregation is even partially compensatory (e.g., a geometric mean rather than a simple product, or a weighted sum with thresholds), the distribution of value shifts from right-skewed (rare eutopia) to normal or left-skewed (common eutopia).
