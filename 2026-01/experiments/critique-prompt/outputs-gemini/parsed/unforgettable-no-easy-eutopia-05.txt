**"The Robustness of Slack"**
The paper infers that because "linear" views require hyper-efficient use of resources (fat tails), we must aim for a narrow target of specific resource configurations to achieve a mostly-great future. However, this creates a "Adversarial Exploit" vulnerability: systems hyper-optimized for specific value configurations are notoriously fragile to perturbations and Goodhart’s Law. A "Common-sense Utopia" that leaves resources unoptimized (slack) might be less valuable in a snapshot but far more robust over deep time than a hyper-fragile "maximally efficient" civilization. If longevity correlates with value, the "sub-optimal" slack-filled future may eventually accrue more total value than the fragile optimized one, reversing the paper's conclusion about which target we should aim for.
