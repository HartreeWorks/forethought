**"The Normative Boomerang of Fussiness"**
The paper defines "fussy" views—those that regard vast, happy, flourishing futures as failures—as "plausible." There is a hidden crux here: a moral theory that classifies a galaxy of happy beings as a tragedy because they aren't *maximally* happy is plausibly a defective moral theory. If a moral view demands a level of precision that makes the good the enemy of the perfect to such an extreme degree, the error likely lies in the theory, not in the difficulty of the future. By basing the argument on the plausibility of these hyper-demanding views, the author risks proving that "Moral Philosophy is broken" rather than "The Future is Hard."
