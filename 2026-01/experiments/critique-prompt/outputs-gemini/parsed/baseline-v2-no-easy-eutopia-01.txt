"The Fallacy of Multiplicative Value Factors" — The paper relies heavily on a model where the value of the future is the product of independent factors, implying that a low score in one dimension (e.g., population size or digital rights) reduces the total value to near zero. This assumes that moral goods are non-substitutable and conjunctive, whereas many value theories view goods as additive or compensatory. For instance, a future with high happiness but low autonomy might still be regarded as highly valuable, rather than worthless, by many utilitarian or pluralist frameworks. By modelling value as a chain that breaks at the weakest link, the authors artificially inflate the probability of a "failed" future.
