> The normalization method chosen to handle moral uncertainty essentially smuggles in the answer, since treating unbounded views' larger scale as deserving more weight presupposes exactly what bounded views contest.

**Parameter sensitivity (Normalization under Moral Uncertainty)**
Section 3.5 argues that under moral uncertainty, we should normalize in a way that often favors unbounded, high-stakes views (variance normalization or pairwise comparison). This argument is highly sensitive to the *choice of normalization parameter*. If we normalize by "capacity for satisfaction" (e.g., a "completed" moral view = 1 unit of decisive reason), bounded views might dominate because they are "cheaper" to satisfy. By treating the sheer scale of unbounded views as a reason to grant them more voting weight, the paper effectively assumes the conclusion that "more resources = more importance," which is exactly what the bounded views dispute.
