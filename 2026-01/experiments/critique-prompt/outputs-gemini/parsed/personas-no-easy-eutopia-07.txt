[**The Mechanism Designer**]
The paper discusses "aiming" for a "best feasible future" but offers no formal specification for how this objective function could be verified or elicited. The critique of "difference-making bounded views" (Section 3.3) relies on abstract algebra about goods and bads ($v_b(g-b)$) without a mechanism to measure these units in a real-world context. Without a specified sensor or oracle to distinguish the "99.99th percentile" future from the "90th percentile" future, the proposal is computationally undecidable. A governance system built on this vagueness will inevitably drift, optimizing for proxy metrics (like GDP or computing cycles) that diverge from "true" value, resulting in Goodhart’s Law failures.
