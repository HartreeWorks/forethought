**Parameter sensitivity (Definition of Best Feasible Future)**
The paper’s central metric for failure—falling short of the "mostly-great" threshold ($>50\%$ of the *best feasible* future)—is hypersensitive to the theoretical upper bound of value. If the "best feasible future" scales linearly or superlinearly with physics optimization (e.g., harnessing vacuum energy or computing at the Landauer limit), the denominator becomes astronomically large. A "Common-sense utopia" that eliminates suffering and spreads across the galaxy could be mathematically indistinguishable from zero value simply because it failed to utilize a speculative physics exploit that increased the theoretical ceiling by $10^{10}$. If the theoretical maximum is practically unattainable, the binary distinction between "fussy" and "easygoing" collapses into a critique of maximizing utility functions rather than a statement about the difficulty of achieving a genuinely good future.
