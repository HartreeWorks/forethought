[**The Institutional Corruptionist**]
The paper concludes that "society must have deliberately optimised" to hit the narrow target (Section 1). This assumes that the institutions created to perform this optimization will remain benevolent. In reality, any institution granted the power to steer humanity toward a specific "moral perfection" will be immediately captured by sociopaths or special interests who will redefine "eutopia" to mean "maximum power for the steering committee." The "No Easy Eutopia" thesis serves as a justification for indefinite emergency powers, ensuring that the "steering" mechanism becomes the primary source of the moral catastrophe it claims to prevent.
