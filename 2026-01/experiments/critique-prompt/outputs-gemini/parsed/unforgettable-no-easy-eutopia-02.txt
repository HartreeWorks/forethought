**"The Disjunctive Defense"**
The paper argues that value is likely "multiplicative," modeled as the product of independent factors ($A \times B \times C...$), meaning a low score on one dimension (e.g., insufficient diversity) collapses the total value of the future. This inference relies on a specific, fragile ontology of value where goods are non-substitutable conditions of one another. However, many plausible moral views are additive or disjunctive: a world with massive happiness but low aesthetic beauty might still be 80% as good as the maximum, not 5% as good. If value factors are even partially substitutable, the paper’s mathematical demonstration of fragility (the $N$-dimensions graph) collapses. The author must demonstrate why moral goods function like links in a chain (weakest link determines strength) rather than ingredients in a meal (missing one ingredient doesn't ruin the calories).
