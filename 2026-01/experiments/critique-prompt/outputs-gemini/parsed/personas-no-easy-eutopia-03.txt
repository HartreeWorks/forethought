The attack on "easygoing liberalism" and "Common-sense utopia" (Section 2.2) functions as a rhetorical pretext for elite rent-seeking. By arguing that a future where everyone is happy, free, and abundant is actually a "moral catastrophe" because it fails to hit a theoretical 99.99th percentile target, the authors justify transferring power from democratic mechanisms (people choosing what they want) to technocratic "moral optimizers." This creates a principal-agent failure where a priestly caste defines the "narrow target" of value to align with their own ideological preferences, effectively stealing the future’s surplus under the guise of preventing "waste."
