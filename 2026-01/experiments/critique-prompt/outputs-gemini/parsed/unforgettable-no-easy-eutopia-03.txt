**"The Correlation Blind Spot"**
In Section 2.4, the paper models the future’s value as a product of $N$ variables sampled from *independent* uniform distributions. This mathematical model drives the conclusion that "mostly-great futures are rare," but it breaks the inference because the factors of a flourishing civilization are likely strongly positively correlated. A society capable of solving the coordination problems to achieve material abundance and eliminate suffering (factors A and B) is structurally much more likely to have the wisdom to solve issues of digital rights or population ethics (factors C and D). By treating these variables as independent coin flips, the paper artificially inflates the difficulty of the target. The argument needs to account for the covariance of civilizational competencies.
