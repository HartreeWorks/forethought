"Ambiguity in the Concept of Feasibility" — The paper defines the "best feasible future" based on a 99.99th percentile outcome, but glosses over the constraints included in "feasibility." If "feasible" implies "physically possible regardless of coordination costs," the benchmark is impossibly high; if it implies "achievable given human psychology and game theory," the benchmark is much lower. By oscillating between a theoretical maximum (to set the bar high) and practical limitations (to show how hard it is to hit), the argument creates a moving target that biases the conclusion toward "No Easy Eutopia."
