"Neglect of Correlated Moral Progress" — The paper treats the factors required for a eutopian future as independent variables, calculating the probability of success as the product of independent probabilities. However, moral and technological factors are often strongly positively correlated; a society with the technological capacity to solve scarcity is also more likely to have the bandwidth to address animal suffering or digital rights. By assuming independence, the authors ignore the "expanding circle" of moral concern, likely underestimating the probability of a civilization getting multiple factors right simultaneously.
