**"The Substrate Ceiling"**
The paper asserts that the distribution of value-per-resource is "fat-tailed" (linear unbounded views), meaning the best computers/minds are exponentially better than average ones. This ignores physical and information-theoretic limits. While *wealth* or *citations* may be fat-tailed, physical efficiency in computing and energy extraction is bounded by the Landauer limit and thermodynamic efficiency. We cannot exponentially improve the "conversion of matter to value" forever; eventually, we hit a hard substrate ceiling where the curve flattens. If the tail is truncated by physics, the gap between a "pretty good" use of resources and the "perfect" use shrinks, making Eutopia a broad plateau rather than a sharp peak.
