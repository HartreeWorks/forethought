"The Problem of Separability and Holistic Value" — The critique of linear views assumes "separability," meaning the value of the universe is the sum of independent spatio-temporal parts. This leads to the conclusion that a mostly-great future requires tiling the universe with the single most efficient configuration of matter (e.g., "happiness machines"). However, if value is holistic—relying on diversity, complexity, or the relationships between parts—then a monolithic, optimized universe would be less valuable than a diverse one. If value is organic rather than modular, the "narrow target" of hyper-efficiency dissolves, and "sub-optimal" but diverse futures may actually be ideal.
