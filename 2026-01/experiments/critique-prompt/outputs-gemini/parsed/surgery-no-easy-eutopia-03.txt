> Fat-tailed distributions fit social/positional goods like wealth, but if conscious experience is biologically bounded like health or lifespan, the paper's key assumption collapses and a "good enough" future becomes much easier to hit.

**Reference class failure (Economic Analogies for Intrinsic Value)**
In Section 3.2, the paper argues that the distribution of value-efficiency is likely fat-tailed, citing wealth, citations, and city sizes as precedents. This is a *Reference class failure*. Wealth and citations are positional goods governed by preferential attachment processes (Pareto distributions), whereas intrinsic goods like health, lifespan, and potentially "wellbeing" often follow normal or log-logistic distributions with biological caps. If the "value" of a conscious experience behaves more like a biological variable (bounded by physical signaling limits) than a social variable (unbounded accumulation), the fat-tail premise fails. Without the fat tail, "Common-sense utopia" is not dwarfed by a hyper-optimized outlier, and the target for a mostly-great future widens significantly.
