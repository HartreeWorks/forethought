[**The Evolutionary Skeptic**]
The authors worry that the future might lock in "unreflective values" (Section 2.3.5), but they ignore that values are selected for their survival utility, not their philosophical purity. A "narrow target" morality that requires precise optimization is evolutionarily fragile; it will be outcompeted by "Common-sense utopia" or other "easygoing" systems which are likely more robust and reproductive. If the "best" future requires a fragile equilibrium that survival pressures naturally erode, then that future is not actually "feasible." The pursuit of this fragile eutopia distracts from the real imperative: reinforcing the evolutionary robustness of civilization against extinction.
