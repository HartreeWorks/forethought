"Implausible Sensitivity in Asymmetric Bounded Views" — The argument that bounded views are "fussy" relies on a specific interpretation where goods and bads are aggregated separately, and bads have an asymmetric weight. The paper suggests that a future filled with $10^{22}$ stars of flourishing could be ruined by a single star’s worth of bads. This assumes a form of negative-dominance so extreme that it borders on strict negative utilitarianism, which is a niche and widely contested position. Most plausible asymmetric views would allow for massive quantities of good to outweigh significant, though smaller, quantities of bad, making the target for success much wider than the paper suggests.
