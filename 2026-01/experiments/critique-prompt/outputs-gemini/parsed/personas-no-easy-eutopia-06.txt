The "Hedonic Treadmill" argument in Section 2.5 fundamentally misunderstands the nature of valuation. The authors treat the treadmill as a bias that hides the "true" absolute scale of value, but cognitive science suggests value is intrinsically relative and prediction-error based; there is no "view from nowhere." If future beings are satisfied and report high well-being, asserting they are in a "catastrophe" because they lack an "objective good" (Section 2.3.3) is a category error. Attempting to optimize for an objective metric that disconnects from the subjective experience of the agents involved leads to "wireheading"—creating a universe of high numbers that no mind actually enjoys.
