"Alienation from Humanistic Value Criteria" — The paper posits that a "Common-sense utopia" (abundant, free, happy humans) could be a moral catastrophe due to failures in esoteric areas like digital rights or acausal trade. This stance reflects a deep alienation from humanistic values, effectively arguing that a world fulfilling the deepest aspirations of current humanity is a failure based on theoretical constructs we cannot currently verify. If a moral theory classifies a universe of universal human flourishing as a "catastrophe" because it fails to satisfy a speculative requirement of "acausal decision theory," one might arguably reject the theory rather than the future.
