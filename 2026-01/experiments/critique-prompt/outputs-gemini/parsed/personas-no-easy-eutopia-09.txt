The claim that "linear views" require almost all resources to be used for a specific end (Section 3.2) ignores the law of diminishing marginal utility. The paper posits a fat-tailed distribution of value-per-resource, assuming that the "best" use of matter is orders of magnitude better than the "second best." In reality, resource allocation is subject to congestion costs and saturation; the trillionth unit of "bliss" is worth less than the first. By modeling value as linear/unbounded, the paper advocates for a "winner-take-all" allocation strategy that misallocates capital toward hyper-specialized ends, destroying the diversification necessary for a stable economy.
