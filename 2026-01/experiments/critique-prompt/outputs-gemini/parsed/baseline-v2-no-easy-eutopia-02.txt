"Distortionary Effects of the 'Best Feasible' Benchmark" — The definition of a "mostly-great" future as achieving at least 50% of the value of the "best feasible future" (defined as the 99.99th percentile outcome) is problematic. If the theoretical ceiling of value is astronomically high (e.g., converting all matter in the universe into optimal computing substrate for pure bliss), then a future that is merely "Star Trek-like"—humanistic, abundant, and suffering-free—might quantitatively score as a failure (e.g., 0.001% of the maximum). This definition creates a binary failure state out of outcomes that would be intuitively viewed as distinct moral triumphs, rendering the concept of "mostly-great" practically useless for decision-making.
