[**The Empirical Hardliner**]
The paper’s entire argument for "eutopian fragility" rests on the unvalidated postulate that the value of the future is the *product* of independent factors ($V = \Pi x_i$) rather than a sum or a complex system with redundancy. In Section 2.4, the authors assert that scoring well on most factors but failing one leads to near-zero value, modeling social wellbeing like a delicate circuit board. Empirical data on human flourishing, however, suggests high substitutability; wealth compensates for health deficits, and social connection compensates for material poverty. By forcing a multiplicative model without historical or sociological evidence, the authors mathematically manufacture a "fragility" that likely does not exist, leading to a false conclusion that we must obsessively optimize every single variable to avoid catastrophe.
