"Unsupported Empirical Claims Regarding Value Distributions" — The argument that linear views are "fussy" rests on the empirical claim that the distribution of value-per-unit-resource is fat-tailed, similar to wealth or citations. While instrumental goods often follow power laws, it is far from obvious that intrinsic goods, such as subjective well-being or virtue, follow the same distribution; many theories suggest diminishing marginal returns to resources for well-being. If the curve of value is flatter at the top—meaning there are many diverse ways to be "nearly best"—then linear views would not require hitting a specific, narrow target to achieve a mostly-great future.
