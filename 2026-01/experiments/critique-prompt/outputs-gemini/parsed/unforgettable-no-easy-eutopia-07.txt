**"The Dilution of Bads"**
In discussing bounded views (Section 3.3), the paper argues that if a view aggregates goods and bads separately, a tiny fraction of bads (e.g., 1 in $10^{22}$ stars) is sufficient to ruin the value of the future. This inference relies on the assumption that the *presence* of bads cancels out the *presence* of goods regardless of ratio. However, this violates strong intuitions about scale and dilution. If a civilization contains a trillion galaxies of pure bliss and one small room of suffering, labeling this a "moral catastrophe" or "worse than extinction" is a reductio ad absurdum of the moral view, not a condemnation of the future. The author needs to show why we should accept moral views that lack any sensitivity to the overwhelming ratio of good to bad.
