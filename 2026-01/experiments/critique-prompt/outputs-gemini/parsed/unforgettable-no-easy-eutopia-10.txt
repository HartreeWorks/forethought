**"The Paradox of Digital Rights"**
The paper cites "misguided attitudes to digital beings" as a key fragility, suggesting that failing to give AI rights could be catastrophic. However, this argument can be reversed: granting full rights to digital beings could be the catastrophe. If digital beings can be copied infinitely at near-zero cost, granting them equal voting/resource rights leads to the immediate disenfranchisement of all biological life and a total consumption of resources for digital reproduction (the "Repugnant Conclusion" via software). The "correct" moral view might actually require *not* granting full egalitarian rights to digital entities to preserve any other form of value. The paper assumes "more rights = better," but in a digital context, "rights" might simply mean "unconstrained replicator dominance."
