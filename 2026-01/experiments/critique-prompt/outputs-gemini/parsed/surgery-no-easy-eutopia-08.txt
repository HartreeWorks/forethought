**Countermodel (Correlated Factors)**
In the "Value as a Product of Factors" model (Section 2.4), the paper assumes the $N$ dimensions of value are independent random variables. A *Correlated Factors Countermodel* posits that the attributes required for a good future are highly covariant. For example, a civilization capable of solving the "population ethics" alignment problem is highly likely to also possess the wisdom to solve the "digital rights" and "animal welfare" problems, as these stem from similar generators (e.g., broad moral circle expansion, advanced reflection). If the factors are positively correlated, the probability of hitting the "product" target does not diminish exponentially with $N$, but clusters around success or failure, making the target much wider than the independent model suggests.
