1. [The Empirical Hardliner] The paper’s central quantitative intuition—Section 2.4’s toy model where “value is the product of many factors” with each factor treated as an independent \(U(0,1)\) draw, yielding most futures near-zero value—asserts “mostly-great futures are rare” without identifying what real-world generative process would make moral-relevance factors independent, continuously distributed, and multiplicative. Independence is doing almost all the work: if the drivers of “digital welfare,” “institutions,” “resource allocation,” and “conflict” share common causes (governance quality, state capacity, tech safety margins), then the tail behavior and mass near zero changes completely. The paper never specifies a falsifiable mapping from observable present-day indicators (institutions, norms, tech capability) to those factor distributions, so the “rare orange sliver” diagram is a rhetorical prior, not an inference. If this objection holds, the paper’s headline conclusion (“easy eutopia is likely wrong”) is an artifact of an ungrounded statistical cartoon, and any downstream prioritization (shift effort from survival to flourishing interventions) is directionally uncalibrated.

2. [The Complexity Theorist] The claim that “single flaws” can unwind most value (Sections 2.3–2.4) relies on a separability picture where the world’s goodness decomposes into many quasi-independent dimensions whose product collapses under one low component. But advanced civilizations are dominated by tightly coupled feedback systems (governance ↔ AI deployment ↔ economic incentives ↔ security dilemmas), so “one flaw” is rarely an isolated scalar—what you call a flaw will often be an emergent property of interactions. In coupled systems, you can get the opposite of your product story: strong positive coupling can create basin-of-attraction dynamics where once you’re inside “common-sense utopia,” the same mechanisms (abundance + coordination tech + enforcement) repair local failures rather than multiplying them into global value-collapse. Your model treats “moral errors” as independent hits; complex systems make them correlated, self-correcting, or phase-transition-like, which invalidates your percentile claims (e.g., “top quartile future is 0.034 when \(N=5\)”). If this objection holds, your “fussiness” conclusion mispredicts the distribution’s shape, and you may end up advocating brittle, over-controlled steering in a world that actually has robust attractors toward decent outcomes.

3. [The Cognitive Scientist] The paper leans on psychological arguments (Section 2.5) that (i) the hedonic treadmill makes near-best futures “recede” as expectations reset, and (ii) future beings could “engineer their preferences” to feel satisfied with “tragically mediocre circumstances,” supporting the thesis that inhabitants won’t notice catastrophic value loss. That assumes a level of preference plasticity and meta-cognitive blindness that conflicts with what we know about stable human drives (status, novelty, social comparison) and about how manipulation becomes a salient grievance once agents can model it. More importantly, it smuggles in an unfalsifiable move: whenever a future looks happy and stable, you can always declare the preferences “engineered” or “adapted,” so the apparent evidence of flourishing never counts. The failure mode is motivated underdetermination: your argument becomes a one-way ratchet toward “still far from eutopia,” no matter what observable welfare looks like. If this objection holds, the essay’s fragility story becomes an epistemic license for paternalistic intervention—treating any reported satisfaction as suspect—and thereby increases the risk of coercive “flourishing optimization” justified by alleged hidden mediocrity.

4. [The Moral Parliament Dissenter] Section 3 tries to make the dispute precise by restricting attention to moral views that satisfy completeness plus the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms, then defining “mostly-great” via gambles between eutopia and extinction. That move is not neutral formalization: it forces lexical constraints and sacred values (common in religious, deontological, and many rights-based views you explicitly list in 2.1) into a compensatory tradeoff framework where “a 60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction” can outrank “guaranteed truly wonderful futures.” The failure mechanism is value laundering: you convert “some acts are impermissible regardless of consequences” into a real-valued utility that can be dominated by tiny-probability astronomical payoffs, and then you treat the resulting fanaticism as a discovery (“linear views are fussy”) rather than an encoding choice. Your later moral-uncertainty section (3.5) compounds this by treating intertheoretic normalization as a technical nuisance rather than a decisive ethical disagreement about comparability. If this objection holds, “no easy eutopia” is largely a byproduct of insisting on a particular aggregation regime, and the paper is effectively arguing “given my aggregation axioms, my aggregation axioms imply fussiness.”

5. [The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper claims early extrasolar settlement “will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us” (2.3.4) and that different allocation rules could be morally catastrophic, implying the problem is to pick a wise rule. In incentive terms, once you publicly frame the stakes as “essentially all future value” and a “narrow target,” you create extreme incentives to defect: race dynamics, secret launches, precommitment to aggressive property claims, and strategic ambiguity to avoid any ex ante constraints. Any “equal allocation” proposal becomes a Schelling point for cheating (front-running, identity multiplication via digital persons, covert proxies), and “first-mover advantage” becomes militarized because the payoff is literally cosmic. The failure mode is that your moral analysis is not game-invariant: it changes actor payoffs and therefore behavior, making the feared scenario more likely. If this objection holds, the essay isn’t just diagnosing risk; it is an accelerant for precisely the land-grab and power concentration it treats as a source of value loss.

6. [The Institutional Corruptionist] In 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 you present digital-rights regimes and space-resource allocations as if “future decision-makers” will be choosing among principled moral options, with the main risk being honest moral error. In real institutions, high-stakes rights decisions under technological asymmetry are dominated by capture: the coalition that controls compute, infrastructure, and enforcement writes the rules, funds the “ethics,” and defines which beings count as “digital persons” in the first place. “AI rights” becomes a compliance layer (audits, charters, voting rituals) while exploitation continues via contract structure, memory editing, fork-and-kill labor, or jurisdiction shopping—none of which your framing treats as central. The failure mechanism is principal–agent collapse: the agents implementing “moral trade” and “compromise” are selected for loyalty to incumbent power, not for tracking moral truth. If this objection holds, the paper’s attention to philosophical fussiness systematically misallocates concern away from the dominant causal driver of bad futures—institutional self-dealing—so your recommended focus on “better futures” deliberation produces paper shields for oligarchy.

7. [The Political Economist] The essay repeatedly treats “what people want,” “compromise,” and “moral diversity” as if they operate in a roughly symmetric bargaining space (e.g., common-sense utopia plus later gestures toward trade/compromise). But in the futures you emphasize—digital beings, vast scalable labor, and space resource capture—the relevant political economy is not symmetric preference aggregation; it is control of capital, enforcement, and replication. The failure mechanism is that power converts “moral disagreement” into rule-setting: the group that can instantiate more copies (digital citizens, worker minds) or control bottlenecks (launch, compute, energy) can dominate “voting rights” and “allocation,” making your moral-parliament picture descriptively wrong. Your own example (2.3.2) that digital beings could become “the large majority of voting power” is not a quirky moral-risk aside; it is the core political economy of representation under replication, and you never analyze the equilibrium institutions it produces (e.g., franchise restrictions, personhood throttling, violent suppression). If this objection holds, the paper’s “fussiness” narrative misses the concrete mechanism of value loss—rent extraction and domination—and may recommend interventions that are naive to power and therefore easily co-opted.

8. [The Adversarial Red-Teamer] Section 2.3.5’s inclusion of “acausal trade,” “simulation deals,” and “infinite value” as live sources of “moral catastrophe” is not harmless breadth; it creates an attack surface. A sophisticated adversary can exploit your “fussy target” framing to justify extreme high-variance actions (“we must take a 20% extinction risk to pursue acausal trade correctly”) and to delegitimize cautious governance as “squandering most value.” The failure mode is memetic weaponization: once these concepts enter elite discourse as respectable, they become rhetorical tools for cult recruitment, grift, and political blackmail (“oppose my project and you’re condemning the universe to mediocrity”). Because your evaluation standard is explicitly gamble-based (3.1–3.5), it is unusually easy to launder reckless programs through tiny-probability astronomical upside. If this objection holds, the essay increases—not decreases—the probability that real-world decision-makers adopt destabilizing ideologies, thereby raising both catastrophic risk and the very “moral error” rates the paper warns about.

9. [The Systems Engineer] The argument that separately-aggregating bounded views imply extreme fussiness—e.g., that “one part in \(10^{22}\)” of resources used for “bads” blocks a mostly-great future (3.3)—treats “badness” like an uncontainable contaminant that linearly sums across the entire civilization. Engineering practice is the opposite: we design fault containment, sandboxing, redundancy, and graceful degradation so that local failures do not scale into global performance collapse. The failure mechanism is conflating moral aggregation with system architecture: even if “a star system’s worth” of bads exists, it does not follow that the rest of the cosmos cannot be engineered to prevent propagation, compensate victims, or sharply bound suffering intensity/duration (the variables that drive disvalue under many views). Your model silently assumes no isolation and no safety margins, then concludes we need near-perfect elimination. If this objection holds, the essay pushes readers toward perfectionist governance that is itself a high-risk design choice—centralized, intrusive, intolerant of experimentation—because it mistakes containable local failures for existential value spoilers.

10. [The Resource Economist] The paper’s linear-view discussion treats value as approximately proportional to captured cosmic resources, yielding claims like “a Milky Way civilization is only one 20-billionth of the value” (3.2) and implying that anything short of near-total expansion is a huge value loss. That assumes the marginal cost of expanding to additional galaxies is negligible relative to the marginal value, ignoring energy budgets, travel/communication lags, coordination overhead, security externalities, and thermodynamic/engineering constraints that make far-flung resources dramatically more expensive per unit usable computation or welfare. The failure mechanism is a broken production function: you treat “resources” as homogenous and freely transformable into value-efficient arrangements, when in reality the shadow price of distant matter rises steeply and the opportunity cost (risk, conflict, governance brittleness) can dominate. This matters because your “fanaticism” examples (3.3) are driven by that scale arithmetic: common-sense utopia looks like \(0.0001\) only because you deny cost-weighted expansion constraints. If this objection holds, the essay biases readers toward expansionism and “industrial explosion” urgency as moral imperatives, potentially justifying reckless colonization and conflict that reduces actual achievable welfare.
