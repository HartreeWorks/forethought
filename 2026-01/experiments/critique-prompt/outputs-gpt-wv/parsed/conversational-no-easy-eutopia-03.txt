> The bar for "mostly-great" keeps moving depending on how much wild upside you imagine, so the paper's pessimism may partly reflect benchmark construction rather than genuine steering difficulty.

**"The 'best feasible future' benchmark is epistemically unstable"**  
Defining “best feasible” as the 99.99th percentile of a “well-informed distribution” over futures makes the central thresholds (0.5, 0.9) extremely sensitive to how that distribution is constructed. In heavy-tailed domains (which the paper itself emphasizes), percentile-based benchmarks can move dramatically when you expand the outcome space, add speculative technologies, or revise cosmic assumptions. That makes “mostly-great is rare” partly an artifact of how wide you cast the hypothesis class, not purely a claim about steering difficulty. It also risks circularity: the more you believe in vast, weird upside, the higher the benchmark rises, and the harder “mostly-great” becomes by definition. A more decision-relevant metric might compare futures to *robust aspiration levels* (e.g., avoiding certain classes of moral catastrophe) rather than percentile-of-a-model benchmarks.
