> Engineering systems routinely contain local failures through sandboxing and redundancy, so treating scattered "bads" as an uncontainable contaminant that linearly poisons the whole cosmos smuggles in an assumption of zero fault isolation.

[The Systems Engineer] The argument that separately-aggregating bounded views imply extreme fussiness—e.g., that “one part in \(10^{22}\)” of resources used for “bads” blocks a mostly-great future (3.3)—treats “badness” like an uncontainable contaminant that linearly sums across the entire civilization. Engineering practice is the opposite: we design fault containment, sandboxing, redundancy, and graceful degradation so that local failures do not scale into global performance collapse. The failure mechanism is conflating moral aggregation with system architecture: even if “a star system’s worth” of bads exists, it does not follow that the rest of the cosmos cannot be engineered to prevent propagation, compensate victims, or sharply bound suffering intensity/duration (the variables that drive disvalue under many views). Your model silently assumes no isolation and no safety margins, then concludes we need near-perfect elimination. If this objection holds, the essay pushes readers toward perfectionist governance that is itself a high-risk design choice—centralized, intrusive, intolerant of experimentation—because it mistakes containable local failures for existential value spoilers.
