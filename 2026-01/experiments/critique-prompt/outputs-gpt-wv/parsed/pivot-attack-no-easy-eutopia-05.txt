> Most "fat tail" examples come from competitive social dynamics, not intrinsic value—if value-per-resource plateaus rather than spikes, many resource allocations could yield near-optimal futures.

**“Fat Tails Are Asserted Where Plateaus Are Plausible”** — This attacks **Pivot P3: “for linear unbounded views, value-per-resource across uses is probably sufficiently fat-tailed that a small fraction of uses capture most value, making mostly-great futures a narrow target”** (load-bearing because it converts linearity from “needs lots of resources” into “needs very specific uses of resources,” i.e., narrowness). The cited analogies (wealth, city sizes, citations, consumer surplus) are about competitive social processes with rich-get-richer dynamics; they don’t straightforwardly transfer to “intrinsically valuable configurations of matter/experience” where there may be many broad basins of near-maximal value. The experiential-evidence offered (Russell/Dostoevsky quotes; a survey of “most intense vs second most intense”) at best suggests heavy tails in *reported intensity*, not in moral value-per-joule, and it doesn’t rule out a wide plateau where many different designs yield ~80–95% of max value-efficiency. If value-efficiency is thin-tailed or plateaued, then “very specific use” is false: many resource allocations yield mostly-great futures, and linear views no longer imply “no easy eutopia.” If this objection holds, the paper would need either a constructive model of future design space generating extreme concentration of value-efficiency (not just analogy) or else concede that linear views may be easygoing conditional on broad near-optimal sets.
