> Dominance violations and scale-tipping are costs, not knockdowns—especially when the alternative is embracing the fanatical implications the paper itself wants to avoid.

**“Stochastic Dominance Isn’t a Knockdown—So ‘Easygoing Views Are Implausible’ Doesn’t Stick”** — This attacks **Pivot P2/P5** where the paper dismisses difference-making bounded views that jointly aggregate goods/bads by citing “violating stochastic dominance” and “scale-tipping,” thereby cordoning off the main easygoing family as “narrow and implausible.” Dominance violations are often treated as a cost, but not a decisive refutation, especially when the alternative is embracing extreme fanatical implications (the essay itself motivates boundedness partly to avoid linear fanatical tradeoffs). Moreover, the “scale-tipping” complaint depends on an intuition that tiny balance shifts shouldn’t flip value from near-worst to near-best—but bounded transforms are *designed* to compress extremes, so sharp phase transitions can be a feature rather than a bug depending on how moral salience is modeled. If dominance violations and tipping are tolerated (or are judged less implausible than the essay’s own linear-view fanatical comparisons), then the “narrow slice” of easygoing views is not obviously less plausible than the fussy alternatives—and the core conclusion (“easygoingness is unlikely”) loses its main eliminative step. If this objection holds, the paper would need a stronger impossibility/representation-style argument showing that any jointly aggregating bounded difference-making view that is easygoing must violate constraints we are unwilling to give up, rather than relying on contestable intuitions about dominance and tipping.
