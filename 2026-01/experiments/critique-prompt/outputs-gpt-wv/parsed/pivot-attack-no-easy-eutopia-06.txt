> A huge option space could contain huge *volumes* of near-optimal arrangements, not just needles—so linear values might be easy to mostly satisfy, not fussy.

**“Linearity ≠ A Unique Replicable Optimum”** — This attacks **Pivot P3’s** further inference: because linear views are separable, “there must be some single ‘value-efficient’ arrangement… such that… one needs to recreate as many of those arrangements as possible,” and missing that makes the target narrow. Separability implies additivity across parcels, but it does not imply that the maximizing local configuration is unique or even rare; there could be vast families of near-maximizers (symmetries, many kinds of flourishing minds, many aesthetic/cultural equilibria) whose per-resource value differs by only a few percent. In that world, a civilization can be “mostly-great” without converging on one exact pattern—it can fill space with heterogeneous but still highly value-efficient structures. If so, the paper’s “astronomical space of actions” cuts the other way: a huge space can contain huge *volumes* of near-optimal choices, not just needles. If this objection holds, the conclusion that linear views are fussy due to “very specific uses” collapses; the paper would need an argument that the near-optimal set is measure-zero/small under realistic constraints, not merely that the option space is large.
