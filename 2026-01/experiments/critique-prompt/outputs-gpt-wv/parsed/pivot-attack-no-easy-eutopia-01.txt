> Near-independence between moral dimensions is doing all the heavy lifting in the product model, but correlated progress under shared institutional drivers could make "pretty good on most dimensions" the norm rather than the exception.

**“Multiplication Smuggles in Independence”** — This attacks **Pivot P1: “the value of the future is (well-)modeled as the product of many relatively independent factors, such that doing badly on any one is enough to lose out on most value”** (load-bearing because it’s the main engine turning “many possible moral flaws” into “mostly-great futures are rare”). The paper’s product model implicitly needs *near-independence* (or at least weak correlation) between dimensions like autonomy, happiness, diversity, digital welfare, etc., yet many of these plausibly move together under the same institutional/technological drivers (e.g., better governance raises many “factors” simultaneously; oppressive lock-in lowers many simultaneously). If the factors are positively correlated, then “scoring well on average” is much more likely to coincide with “scoring well on almost all,” which collapses the claimed extreme right-skew where most futures are tiny fractions of the best. In that case, “single-flaw fragility” becomes less representative: the modal future might be “pretty good on most dimensions” rather than “excellent except for one catastrophic miss.” If this objection holds, the paper can no longer infer “no easy eutopia” from “many dimensions matter”; it would need a different, non-independence-based argument that *even given correlated progress* the remaining failure modes still dominate expected value.
