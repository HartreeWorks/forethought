> Treating every galaxy's resources as equally cheap to harvest ignores that the real cost of reaching distant matter rises steeply, which is what makes the "common-sense utopia is tiny" arithmetic seem so damning.

[The Resource Economist] The paper’s linear-view discussion treats value as approximately proportional to captured cosmic resources, yielding claims like “a Milky Way civilization is only one 20-billionth of the value” (3.2) and implying that anything short of near-total expansion is a huge value loss. That assumes the marginal cost of expanding to additional galaxies is negligible relative to the marginal value, ignoring energy budgets, travel/communication lags, coordination overhead, security externalities, and thermodynamic/engineering constraints that make far-flung resources dramatically more expensive per unit usable computation or welfare. The failure mechanism is a broken production function: you treat “resources” as homogenous and freely transformable into value-efficient arrangements, when in reality the shadow price of distant matter rises steeply and the opportunity cost (risk, conflict, governance brittleness) can dominate. This matters because your “fanaticism” examples (3.3) are driven by that scale arithmetic: common-sense utopia looks like \(0.0001\) only because you deny cost-weighted expansion constraints. If this objection holds, the essay biases readers toward expansionism and “industrial explosion” urgency as moral imperatives, potentially justifying reckless colonization and conflict that reduces actual achievable welfare.
