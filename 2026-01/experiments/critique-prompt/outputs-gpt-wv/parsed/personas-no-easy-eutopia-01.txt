> The toy model's "most futures are near-zero" result hinges entirely on assuming independence between factors—but if governance, safety, and institutions share common causes, the distribution reshapes dramatically.

[The Empirical Hardliner] The paper’s central quantitative intuition—Section 2.4’s toy model where “value is the product of many factors” with each factor treated as an independent \(U(0,1)\) draw, yielding most futures near-zero value—asserts “mostly-great futures are rare” without identifying what real-world generative process would make moral-relevance factors independent, continuously distributed, and multiplicative. Independence is doing almost all the work: if the drivers of “digital welfare,” “institutions,” “resource allocation,” and “conflict” share common causes (governance quality, state capacity, tech safety margins), then the tail behavior and mass near zero changes completely. The paper never specifies a falsifiable mapping from observable present-day indicators (institutions, norms, tech capability) to those factor distributions, so the “rare orange sliver” diagram is a rhetorical prior, not an inference. If this objection holds, the paper’s headline conclusion (“easy eutopia is likely wrong”) is an artifact of an ungrounded statistical cartoon, and any downstream prioritization (shift effort from survival to flourishing interventions) is directionally uncalibrated.
