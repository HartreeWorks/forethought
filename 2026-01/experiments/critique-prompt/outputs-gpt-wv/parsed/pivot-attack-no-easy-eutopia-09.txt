> The essay's own example of rankings flipping under different normalisation choices actually undermines its claim that "fair" uncertainty methods favour fussy theories, since many leading frameworks are specifically designed to avoid letting any single high-range view dominate.

**“Moral Uncertainty Doesn’t Privilege the Fussiest Theories by Default”** — This attacks **Pivot P5: “on plausible intertheoretic comparison methods (variance normalization; pairwise reasoning), unbounded views loom larger, so aggregation under moral uncertainty is itself fussy”** (load-bearing because it tries to make “no easy eutopia” robust to not knowing the true theory). The essay’s own demonstration shows rankings flip dramatically with the normalization choice, which undercuts the later claim that the “fairest” approaches tend to weight unbounded (and thus fussy) views more; many philosophers instead use decision rules designed to avoid normalization arbitrariness (e.g., parliamentary/ bargaining models, minimax regret across theories, dominance-avoiding constraints) that do not mechanically amplify unbounded stakes. If one adopts an uncertainty framework that treats “comparability failures” as reason to avoid letting any single high-range theory dominate, then easygoing bounded views can retain substantial decision weight, and “easygoingness unlikely” no longer follows from moral uncertainty. If this objection holds, the paper must either defend a specific intertheoretic framework strongly enough that the “fussy-weighting” result is not optional, or else downgrade the robustness claim and admit that under many reasonable meta-ethical decision procedures, easy eutopia could remain a live default hypothesis.
