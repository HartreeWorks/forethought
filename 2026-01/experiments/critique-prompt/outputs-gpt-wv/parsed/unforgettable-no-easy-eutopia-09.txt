> If preferences can be engineered to produce contentment, that's only a tragedy if you've already rejected preference-satisfactionism—yet the paper treats it as a live contender.

**“Preference-Laundering Backfire”** — The paper argues that *even if everyone in a rich future gets what they self-interestedly want, the world could still miss most value* **(B)** from the claim that *future agents can engineer preferences and be content in ‘tragically mediocre’ circumstances* **(A)**, because *contentment doesn’t track objective moral value and can mask catastrophe* **(M)**. But this move undercuts the paper’s own use of “easygoing liberalism” as a serious candidate and destabilizes its treatment of preference-based wellbeing: if preference-satisfactionism is among the plausible views you’re aggregating over (and the paper treats it as a main contender), then preference engineering is not “masking” low value—it is constitutive of high value, making eutopia *easier* rather than harder. The paper tries to have it both ways: using preference-satisfactionism as a live theory in the wellbeing taxonomy, while also treating preference plasticity as evidence that apparent flourishing is unreliable. That makes the central inference from “agents can be satisfied with mediocrity” to “mostly-great is narrow” depend on already rejecting a big swath of the “plausible views” set. If this objection holds, the argument either needs to exclude preference-satisfactionist families from the plausibility class (and say why), or treat preference engineering as a *positive* lever that expands the eutopian basin for a major chunk of moral credence. The paper would have to restructure the “common-sense utopia still flawed” section to avoid relying on a diagnostic (contentment is cheap) that is itself theory-contingent in exactly the way the paper is trying to stay robust to.
