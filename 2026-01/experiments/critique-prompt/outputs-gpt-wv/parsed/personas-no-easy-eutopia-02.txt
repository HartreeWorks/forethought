> In tightly coupled civilisations, flaws aren't independent multipliers—they're correlated and often self-correcting, so the "one bad dimension tanks everything" model likely overstates fragility.

[The Complexity Theorist] The claim that “single flaws” can unwind most value (Sections 2.3–2.4) relies on a separability picture where the world’s goodness decomposes into many quasi-independent dimensions whose product collapses under one low component. But advanced civilizations are dominated by tightly coupled feedback systems (governance ↔ AI deployment ↔ economic incentives ↔ security dilemmas), so “one flaw” is rarely an isolated scalar—what you call a flaw will often be an emergent property of interactions. In coupled systems, you can get the opposite of your product story: strong positive coupling can create basin-of-attraction dynamics where once you’re inside “common-sense utopia,” the same mechanisms (abundance + coordination tech + enforcement) repair local failures rather than multiplying them into global value-collapse. Your model treats “moral errors” as independent hits; complex systems make them correlated, self-correcting, or phase-transition-like, which invalidates your percentile claims (e.g., “top quartile future is 0.034 when \(N=5\)”). If this objection holds, your “fussiness” conclusion mispredicts the distribution’s shape, and you may end up advocating brittle, over-controlled steering in a world that actually has robust attractors toward decent outcomes.
