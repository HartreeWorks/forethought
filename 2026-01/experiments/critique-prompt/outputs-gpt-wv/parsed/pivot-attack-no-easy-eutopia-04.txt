> The "one bad star in 10²² ruins everything" claim quietly assumes bads scale linearly with cosmic resources and hit the disvalue bound fast, but most bounded aggregation setups wouldn't actually behave that way.

**“The 10²² Stars Move: A Units/Measure Bug”** — This attacks **Pivot P2’s** key quantitative punchline: on separate-aggregation bounded views, “even if as little as one resource in 10²² is used toward bads rather than goods, we don’t reach a mostly-great future,” making such views “obsessively” fussy. That inference assumes (i) that “one part in 10²²” corresponds to a morally comparable “star system’s worth” of bads, (ii) that the bounded transform treats that aggregate as putting you >50% toward the disvalue bound, and (iii) that “goods” and “bads” scale in commensurate units across cosmic expansion—none of which is established by the paper’s setup. In many plausible separate-aggregation specifications, the bounded function could saturate *much more slowly* for bads than the star-count heuristic implies, or the relevant “bad” might be localized and not scale linearly with captured mass/energy (e.g., a small region of rights violations doesn’t automatically equal “a star system’s worth of intense suffering”). If the mapping from “fraction of resources” to “fraction of disvalue bound” is wrong, the “tiny bad ruins mostly-great” result evaporates, and separate-aggregation bounded views may be only mildly fussy (or even easygoing). If this objection holds, the paper must replace the star-count argument with an explicit, defensible measure of how bads scale with expansion and how the bounded transform behaves over that scale—otherwise “bounded views are fussy too” is unsupported.
