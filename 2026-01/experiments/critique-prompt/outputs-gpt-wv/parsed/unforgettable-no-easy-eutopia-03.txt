> If the moral dimensions aren't strictly complementary—if being extraordinary on a few axes can compensate for mediocrity on others—the multiplicative fragility argument falls apart entirely.

**“Complementarity Mirage”** — The paper argues that *single flaws can erase most value so mostly-great outcomes are rare* **(B)** from the claim that *future value is well-modeled as a product of many quasi-independent factors* **(A)**, because *multiplication makes the distribution extremely right-skewed and punishes any low-scoring dimension* **(M)**. But the product structure is doing nearly all the work, and it implicitly assumes strong complementarity: that improvements in one dimension can’t compensate for shortfalls in another in the relevant moral views. Many of the paper’s own candidate dimensions (autonomy, diversity, bliss, scale, justice) behave more like partial substitutes under pluralistic moral uncertainty: worlds can be “rescued” by being extremely good on a few decisive axes even if middling on others, which is exactly what additive or maximin/leximin hybrids capture. If moral pluralism pushes toward *portfolio* aggregation (“be very good at some things, decent at the rest”) rather than complementarity, then the skewness argument collapses and “mostly-great” can be a large basin rather than a knife-edge. This isn’t a patchable modeling tweak, because it reverses the paper’s mechanism for fragility in Section 2.4 and undermines the intuitive force of the “one flaw unwinds everything” examples. If this objection holds, the paper would need to justify complementarity as a default under the specific moral-uncertainty regime it endorses (trade/compromise), or else replace the product model with an aggregation family and show fragility across that family.
