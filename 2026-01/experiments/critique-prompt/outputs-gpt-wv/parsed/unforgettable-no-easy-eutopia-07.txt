> Separability—the hidden load-bearing assumption that each parcel of resources contributes value independently—quietly rules out the paper's own earlier mechanisms (acausal trade, relational ethics) that would make missing some galaxies far less catastrophic.

**“Separability Smuggles the Conclusion”** — The paper argues that *linear unbounded views make eutopia fussy because you must control most accessible resources and allocate them nearly optimally* **(B)** from the claim that *linear views are separable across space/time at some granularity, so each parcel contributes independently and can be replicated* **(A)**, because *separability implies additive scaling and makes missed resources unrecoverable value loss* **(M)**. Yet the separability premise quietly rules out several of the paper’s own earlier-listed mechanisms that would make “missing some resources” less catastrophic, such as acausal trade, coordination with other civilizations, or moral views where relational/structural properties (legitimacy, rights, non-domination) dominate over sheer replication of value-efficient microstructures. If what matters includes global properties (e.g., whether exploitation occurs anywhere, whether governance is legitimate, whether agents stand in certain relations), then linearity in “resources used for good stuff” does not imply separability—and the inference from “many galaxies exist” to “must personally capture them” weakens. This isn’t a generic “economics vs ethics” complaint; it targets the specific bridge in 3.2 from linearity to “one 20-billionth of value” via a replication picture. If the bridge fails, linear views might be fussy in a *different* way (rights violations) or not fussy about cosmic land-grabs at all. To fix it, the paper would need to defend separability for the morally relevant units under the candidate linear views, or explicitly show that the main results survive when value depends on non-separable global constraints.
