> Most moral views would call certain features of a good-looking future "deeply wrong" without concluding that flaw wipes out nearly all the value gap between extinction and utopia.

**“Moral Disagreement ≠ Massive Value Loss”** — This attacks **Pivot P1/P4 as instantiated in Section 2’s rhetorical core: because many moral perspectives can label the present a “moral catastrophe,” a single non-obvious flaw can erase “most value” in futures that look wonderful, so easy eutopia is unlikely. The move silently equates “a view would call this deeply wrong” with “this world loses most of the value gap between extinction and eutopia,” but the paper’s own cardinalization (e.g., the 50–50 gamble test) is much more demanding than mere condemnation. Many listed perspectives (religious non-adherence, conservative sexual norms, communism’s alienation claims) plausibly imply “world is meaningfully flawed” without implying “worse than a 60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction,” which is the essay’s stated startling implication of no-easy-eutopia. If moral views typically assign large but not dominating disvalue to their “catastrophe,” then single flaws don’t generally multiply value toward zero, and the fragility premise weakens. If this objection holds, the paper must either (i) demonstrate that a large fraction of plausible views really do imply *near-total* value loss from such flaws under its own quantitative criterion, or (ii) retreat to a weaker conclusion (“many futures are meaningfully suboptimal”) that no longer supports the strategic “flourishing work dwarfs survival work” motivation that animates the broader Better Futures framing.
