> The "bounded views collapse to linear" argument depends on us being cosmically insignificant, but if intelligent life is rare or expansion is hard, bounded concavity stays practically relevant and the paper's case weakens.

**"The bounded-view critique leans too hard on controversial cosmic premises"**  
When arguing that many bounded views become “in-practice linear,” the paper relies on the universe being enormous (possibly infinite), with many alien civilizations, making humanity’s marginal contribution tiny so concave functions localize to linear. But if (i) the Great Filter is ahead, (ii) interstellar life is rare, (iii) expansion is hard, or (iv) moral concern is domain-relative (e.g., special obligations, relational views, or “our light cone” ethics), then the “tiny marginal difference” premise can fail. Even staying longtermist, you can accept astronomical stakes without assuming we are a rounding error relative to an already-value-saturated cosmos. The paper’s move here risks turning a normative conclusion (“easygoing bounded views are unlikely”) into a hostage of highly uncertain cosmology/astrobiology. A critic could argue that under plausible uncertainty, bounded concavity could remain practically relevant and make “mostly-great” easier than claimed.
