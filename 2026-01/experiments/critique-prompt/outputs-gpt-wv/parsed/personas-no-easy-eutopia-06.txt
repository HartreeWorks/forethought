> The real danger isn't getting the philosophy wrong—it's that whoever controls compute will write the rules, staff the ethics boards, and define "personhood" to serve their own interests.

[The Institutional Corruptionist] In 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 you present digital-rights regimes and space-resource allocations as if “future decision-makers” will be choosing among principled moral options, with the main risk being honest moral error. In real institutions, high-stakes rights decisions under technological asymmetry are dominated by capture: the coalition that controls compute, infrastructure, and enforcement writes the rules, funds the “ethics,” and defines which beings count as “digital persons” in the first place. “AI rights” becomes a compliance layer (audits, charters, voting rituals) while exploitation continues via contract structure, memory editing, fork-and-kill labor, or jurisdiction shopping—none of which your framing treats as central. The failure mechanism is principal–agent collapse: the agents implementing “moral trade” and “compromise” are selected for loyalty to incumbent power, not for tracking moral truth. If this objection holds, the paper’s attention to philosophical fussiness systematically misallocates concern away from the dominant causal driver of bad futures—institutional self-dealing—so your recommended focus on “better futures” deliberation produces paper shields for oligarchy.
