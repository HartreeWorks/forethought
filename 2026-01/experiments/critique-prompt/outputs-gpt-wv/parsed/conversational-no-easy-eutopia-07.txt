> The "tiny fraction of bads ruins everything" result is an artifact of specific aggregation and scaling assumptions, not a robust ethical conclusion—localized harms don't necessarily scale like energy across a cosmos.

**"The 'separate aggregation makes bads dominate' result is model-dependent and potentially alarmist"**  
The dramatic claim that as little as one part in \(10^{22}\) of resources going to “bads” prevents a mostly-great future hinges on symmetric bounding choices and on treating “a star system’s worth of bads” as automatically half-maximal disvalue. But moral bads are not naturally measured in “resource share,” and disvalue may not scale linearly with physical extent if the bad is localized, low-intensity, or avoidable by design. Many ethical views treat some harms as lexically severe (torture) but not all “bads” as fungible mass terms that aggregate like energy. Also, governance mechanisms could quarantine, compensate, or end bad states quickly, changing the relevant metric from “fraction of cosmos that is bad” to “total integrated suffering,” which may be tractably minimized. The upshot is that the “tiny fraction of bads ruins everything” conclusion looks like an artifact of a particular aggregation + scaling story, not a robust property of bounded ethics.
