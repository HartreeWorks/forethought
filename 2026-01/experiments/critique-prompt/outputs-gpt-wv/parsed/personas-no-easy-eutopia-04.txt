> The critique's core mechanism is value laundering: forcing deontological and rights-based views into expected-utility gambles smuggles in the very fanaticism the paper then "discovers," making the conclusion circular.

[The Moral Parliament Dissenter] Section 3 tries to make the dispute precise by restricting attention to moral views that satisfy completeness plus the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms, then defining “mostly-great” via gambles between eutopia and extinction. That move is not neutral formalization: it forces lexical constraints and sacred values (common in religious, deontological, and many rights-based views you explicitly list in 2.1) into a compensatory tradeoff framework where “a 60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction” can outrank “guaranteed truly wonderful futures.” The failure mechanism is value laundering: you convert “some acts are impermissible regardless of consequences” into a real-valued utility that can be dominated by tiny-probability astronomical payoffs, and then you treat the resulting fanaticism as a discovery (“linear views are fussy”) rather than an encoding choice. Your later moral-uncertainty section (3.5) compounds this by treating intertheoretic normalization as a technical nuisance rather than a decisive ethical disagreement about comparability. If this objection holds, “no easy eutopia” is largely a byproduct of insisting on a particular aggregation regime, and the paper is effectively arguing “given my aggregation axioms, my aggregation axioms imply fussiness.”
