> Framing speculative ideas like acausal trade as legitimate moral concerns creates a rhetorical attack surface that sophisticated bad actors can exploit to justify reckless, high-variance actions.

[The Adversarial Red-Teamer] Section 2.3.5’s inclusion of “acausal trade,” “simulation deals,” and “infinite value” as live sources of “moral catastrophe” is not harmless breadth; it creates an attack surface. A sophisticated adversary can exploit your “fussy target” framing to justify extreme high-variance actions (“we must take a 20% extinction risk to pursue acausal trade correctly”) and to delegitimize cautious governance as “squandering most value.” The failure mode is memetic weaponization: once these concepts enter elite discourse as respectable, they become rhetorical tools for cult recruitment, grift, and political blackmail (“oppose my project and you’re condemning the universe to mediocrity”). Because your evaluation standard is explicitly gamble-based (3.1–3.5), it is unusually easy to launder reckless programs through tiny-probability astronomical upside. If this objection holds, the essay increases—not decreases—the probability that real-world decision-makers adopt destabilizing ideologies, thereby raising both catastrophic risk and the very “moral error” rates the paper warns about.
