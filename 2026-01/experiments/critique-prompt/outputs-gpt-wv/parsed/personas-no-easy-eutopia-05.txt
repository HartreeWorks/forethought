> By publicly framing extrasolar resources as "essentially all future value," the essay itself creates extreme incentives to defect—racing, cheating, and front-running—potentially accelerating the very land-grab it warns against.

[The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper claims early extrasolar settlement “will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us” (2.3.4) and that different allocation rules could be morally catastrophic, implying the problem is to pick a wise rule. In incentive terms, once you publicly frame the stakes as “essentially all future value” and a “narrow target,” you create extreme incentives to defect: race dynamics, secret launches, precommitment to aggressive property claims, and strategic ambiguity to avoid any ex ante constraints. Any “equal allocation” proposal becomes a Schelling point for cheating (front-running, identity multiplication via digital persons, covert proxies), and “first-mover advantage” becomes militarized because the payoff is literally cosmic. The failure mode is that your moral analysis is not game-invariant: it changes actor payoffs and therefore behavior, making the feared scenario more likely. If this objection holds, the essay isn’t just diagnosing risk; it is an accelerant for precisely the land-grab and power concentration it treats as a source of value loss.
