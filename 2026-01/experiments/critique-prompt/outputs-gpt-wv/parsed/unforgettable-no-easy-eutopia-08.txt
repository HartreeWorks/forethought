> The "tiny fraction of vast resources" argument secretly depends on choosing star-systems as the moral unit—switch to per-capita bounds or worst-case pockets and the same civilisation looks fine or hopeless regardless of fraction.

**“Grain-Size Catastrophe”** — The paper argues that *separately aggregating bounded views are extremely fussy because even \(1/10^{22}\) of resources used badly ruins ‘mostly-great’* **(B)** from the claim that *with ~\(10^{22}\) star-systems, even a one-star-system equivalent of bads pushes you past half the disvalue bound* **(A)**, because *aggregation over an enormous count makes tiny fractions morally decisive* **(M)**. But this inference depends on an arbitrary moral “grain size” (star-systems as the unit) and assumes bads scale linearly and comparably across heterogeneous regions; many plausible separable-bads views instead treat bads as (i) saturating locally (there’s only so much disvalue a region can contain), (ii) morally quarantinable (isolated harms don’t contaminate global value), or (iii) dominated by worst-case pockets (so the relevant unit isn’t “one star” but “maximum suffering intensity anywhere”). Change the grain and the conclusion flips: the same civilization could look near-best if harms are strictly bounded per capita and aggressively isolated, or look hopeless if tiny pockets host astronomical suffering, regardless of fraction. The paper presents the \(10^{22}\) arithmetic as if it were structural, but it’s actually doing hidden work: picking a unit that makes “tiny fraction” translate into “huge absolute.” If this objection holds, Section 3.3’s “bads must be almost eliminated” result can’t be derived from bounded separate aggregation without a principled account of moral measure, locality, and how disvalue composes over space. To repair it, the paper would need to specify and defend a morally grounded measure over harms (intensity, duration, distribution, locality) rather than relying on star-count scaling.
