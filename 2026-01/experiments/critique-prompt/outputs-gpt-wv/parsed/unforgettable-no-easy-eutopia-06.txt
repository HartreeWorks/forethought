> Search at scale turns fat-tailed value distributions from an obstacle into an advantage, since advanced civilizations are essentially optimisation machines that can rapidly sample their way to the extreme tail.

**“Fat-Tail Search Dividend”** — The paper argues that *on linear/unbounded views, a mostly-great future requires extremely specific resource uses* **(B)** from the claim that *value-per-resource is fat-tailed, so only rare configurations achieve near-max efficiency* **(A)**, because *fat tails imply most random uses are far from the top and you must hit the extreme tail to get most value* **(M)**. But fat tails also imply something the paper doesn’t price in: if civilization can run massive parallel experimentation (especially with digital labor and simulation), then the expected maximum of many draws climbs rapidly, making “rare gems” easier to find than under thin-tailed landscapes. In other words, the same heavy-tailedness that makes the average configuration mediocre can make the best-found configuration accessible via search—and advanced civilizations are exactly search machines. Under this dynamic, the narrowness of the *set* of optimal configurations doesn’t translate into a low *probability of discovering* one, so the fat-tail premise can support “easy eutopia given survival and capability” rather than its negation. This attacks a load-bearing step in Section 3.2 where “astronomical space of uses” is treated as an obstacle rather than a substrate for optimization. If this objection holds, the paper must model not just the distribution of value across configurations but also the civilization’s sampling power, exploration incentives, and meta-optimization—otherwise the fat-tail argument points the wrong way.
