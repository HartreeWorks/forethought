> Multiplying scores across many dimensions secretly guarantees that any single shortfall tanks the overall result—but most plausible moral frameworks allow partial compensation between domains rather than treating every axis as a veto.

**"The 'product of factors' model smuggles in fragility"**  
The paper’s core intuitive engine is that future value is multiplicative across many “independent” dimensions, making near-best outcomes rare. But multiplicativity is not a neutral default; it effectively builds in the conclusion that one severe flaw can dominate everything else. Many plausible moral aggregators are closer to additive-with-thresholds, leaky minima, or “diminishing penalties,” where big wins in one domain partially compensate for shortfalls elsewhere. Even within pluralistic ethics, people often endorse lexical priorities only for a small set of constraints (e.g., extreme suffering), not dozens of roughly-equal multipliers. Without a principled argument for *why* the right moral view (or robust moral uncertainty policy) should behave multiplicatively across many axes, the toy model risks being more rhetoric than inference. A related issue is that “mostly-great = 50% of best feasible” becomes hostage to the chosen functional form rather than tracking a stable intuition.
