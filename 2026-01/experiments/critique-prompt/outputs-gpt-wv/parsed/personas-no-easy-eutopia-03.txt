> The hedonic-treadmill argument is an unfalsifiable ratchet: any future that looks happy can be dismissed as "adapted preferences," turning the thesis into a licence for paternalistic override.

[The Cognitive Scientist] The paper leans on psychological arguments (Section 2.5) that (i) the hedonic treadmill makes near-best futures “recede” as expectations reset, and (ii) future beings could “engineer their preferences” to feel satisfied with “tragically mediocre circumstances,” supporting the thesis that inhabitants won’t notice catastrophic value loss. That assumes a level of preference plasticity and meta-cognitive blindness that conflicts with what we know about stable human drives (status, novelty, social comparison) and about how manipulation becomes a salient grievance once agents can model it. More importantly, it smuggles in an unfalsifiable move: whenever a future looks happy and stable, you can always declare the preferences “engineered” or “adapted,” so the apparent evidence of flourishing never counts. The failure mode is motivated underdetermination: your argument becomes a one-way ratchet toward “still far from eutopia,” no matter what observable welfare looks like. If this objection holds, the essay’s fragility story becomes an epistemic license for paternalistic intervention—treating any reported satisfaction as suspect—and thereby increases the risk of coercive “flourishing optimization” justified by alleged hidden mediocrity.
