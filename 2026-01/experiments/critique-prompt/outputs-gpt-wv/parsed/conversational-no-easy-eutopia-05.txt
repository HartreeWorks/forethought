> The case that missing cosmic expansion is catastrophic only holds if you buy near-linear returns to scale—but many reasonable moral views accept diminishing returns, making the "no easy eutopia" claim less decisive than presented.

**"Linear unbounded views are treated as more default than justified"**  
A major plank is that for unbounded linear views, missing galaxy-scale expansion forfeits almost all value, making “common-sense utopia” look tiny. But whether value is effectively linear in cosmic resources depends on contested population ethics, welfare comparability across radically different minds, and whether the marginal value of additional lives/compute saturates. Many people (including many consequentialists) accept some form of diminishing returns, person-affecting constraints, variable critical levels, or reasons to prioritize quality/rights over sheer quantity. The paper acknowledges bounded/concave possibilities, but often argues they are “approximately linear in practice” by invoking the huge universe and other civilizations—claims that import additional empirical and normative assumptions. If linearity is doing the work, the paper needs a tighter case that linear-ish, resource-separable views deserve dominant credence under moral uncertainty rather than being one family among many. Otherwise “no easy eutopia” partially reduces to “if total utilitarianism-like views are right, scale matters a lot,” which is less novel and less decisive.
