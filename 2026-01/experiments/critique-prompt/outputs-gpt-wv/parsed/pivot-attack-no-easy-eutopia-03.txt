> If advanced life is rare and we can influence a large fraction of the accessible universe, our marginal contribution isn't small—so bounded views stay genuinely concave rather than collapsing into linear fussiness.

**“Bounded-But-Not-Linear: The ‘Alien Universe’ Assumption”** — This attacks **Pivot P2: “if value is bounded with respect to the universe as a whole, then because the universe is huge and full of other value, humanity’s marginal impact is tiny, so strictly concave bounded views are approximately linear in practice (therefore fussy)”** (load-bearing because it rules out a large class of easygoing bounded views by collapsing them into the “linear = fussy” bucket). The argument hinges on a strong empirical/cosmological premise: that there is vast independent value “out there” (many alien civilizations, or effectively infinite background value) making our contribution a differential rounding error. But if the Great Filter is ahead, if advanced life is rare, if most of the universe is value-empty without our expansion, or if we can causally influence a large fraction of accessible matter-lightcone, then our marginal contribution is not “small,” and bounded concavity is not locally linear over the relevant range. Under those conditions, bounded views can genuinely be non-linear in the region we control, potentially making “common-sense utopia” close to the bound and thus easygoing. If this objection holds, the paper’s classification (“bounded views mostly reduce to linear fussiness”) breaks, and the conclusion that “only a narrow slice of bounded views are easygoing” would need to be rebuilt without leaning on speculative cosmological abundance of independent value.
