> If you take the paper's own admission that normalization choices can flip its recommendations seriously, the confident headline that "eutopia is hard" shrinks to a much narrower, framework-dependent claim.

**"Intertheoretic comparison skepticism cuts against the paper’s practical confidence"**  
The final sections concede that intertheoretic value comparisons are “thorny” and that normalization choices can flip which strategies look best (safety-focused vs upside-focused). But earlier conclusions (e.g., easygoingness is unlikely; fussy views dominate) are presented with more confidence than the uncertainty machinery seems to warrant. If moral uncertainty is severe enough that different plausible normalization schemes reverse recommendations, then claims like “we should expect fussy views to loom larger” need stronger justification than informal plausibility. In particular, the argument that “fair” comparisons often make unbounded views higher-stakes is itself contested in the moral uncertainty literature, and alternative approaches (e.g., bargaining/Parfitian meta-ethics, parliamentary models, maximin constraints, or imprecise credences) can mute the dominance of fussy/unbounded theories. This matters because the headline conclusion (“no easy eutopia”) is practically meaningful only if it survives reasonable meta-ethical variance. Otherwise the paper may be best read as “conditional on certain moral-uncertainty frameworks, eutopia is hard,” which is a narrower and less action-guiding claim.
