> Fat-tailed value distributions could just as easily mean many near-winners are easy to stumble into, rather than that most futures miss a narrow optimum.

**"The fat-tailed 'value-efficiency' argument lacks a bridge from tails to target narrowness"**  
Even if value-per-resource is fat-tailed across possible uses of matter/compute, it doesn’t follow that *realistic* futures without deliberate optimization land far from the tail. Human and institutional selection pressures already push toward efficiency on many dimensions (health, technology, preference satisfaction), and advanced AI systems might intensify that by default. Moreover, fat tails often imply that a few opportunities dominate, but also that there are *many near-winners* (thick upper tail), which can make “good enough” easier than “the unique optimum.” The paper sometimes slides from “the best is vastly better than the median” to “most futures miss most value,” but the latter requires assumptions about how likely societies are to stumble into the upper tail. Without an explicit model of search/optimization dynamics (who searches, with what objective, under what constraints), fat-tailedness alone doesn’t establish a narrow eutopian target. In fact, the same fat-tailed structure can motivate “there will be lots of big wins to pick up” rather than “almost everything is tragically mediocre.”
