> The real threat isn't moral disagreement but power asymmetry—whoever controls replication, compute, and bottlenecks can dominate any moral parliament, making symmetric compromise frameworks dangerously naive.

[The Political Economist] The essay repeatedly treats “what people want,” “compromise,” and “moral diversity” as if they operate in a roughly symmetric bargaining space (e.g., common-sense utopia plus later gestures toward trade/compromise). But in the futures you emphasize—digital beings, vast scalable labor, and space resource capture—the relevant political economy is not symmetric preference aggregation; it is control of capital, enforcement, and replication. The failure mechanism is that power converts “moral disagreement” into rule-setting: the group that can instantiate more copies (digital citizens, worker minds) or control bottlenecks (launch, compute, energy) can dominate “voting rights” and “allocation,” making your moral-parliament picture descriptively wrong. Your own example (2.3.2) that digital beings could become “the large majority of voting power” is not a quirky moral-risk aside; it is the core political economy of representation under replication, and you never analyze the equilibrium institutions it produces (e.g., franchise restrictions, personhood throttling, violent suppression). If this objection holds, the paper’s “fussiness” narrative misses the concrete mechanism of value loss—rent extraction and domination—and may recommend interventions that are naive to power and therefore easily co-opted.
