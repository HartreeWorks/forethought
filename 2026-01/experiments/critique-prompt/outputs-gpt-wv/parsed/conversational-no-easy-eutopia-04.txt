> Moral blindness throughout history shows we might be wrong about something, but that's a long way from proving that abundance and better information won't naturally fix many of those wrongs.

**"From 'many moral views condemn the present' to 'eutopia is hard' is a weak inference"**  
The historical observation—most societies were morally blind to major wrongs—supports humility, but it doesn’t directly imply that high-tech abundance futures are unlikely to resolve many wrongs by default. Some moral failures were sustained by coordination problems, scarcity, and lack of empathy/knowledge; those drivers plausibly weaken with prosperity, education, and transparency tools. The fact that moral perspectives disagree today also doesn’t show that *future* reflection won’t converge on a set of reforms that score well across many perspectives. The argument risks equivocating between “we might be wrong about something big” and “therefore near-best is a tiny target.” You’d need a more concrete model of moral learning dynamics, not just a catalog of contemporary disagreements. Otherwise the paper may be selecting evidence (moral dissensus) that is equally consistent with “progress is lumpy but strong once capability and information rise.”
