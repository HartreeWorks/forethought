> The toy uniform-distribution model silently assumes each moral factor is equally likely to be terrible or excellent, but if abundance and institutions push most factors near 0.9, "mostly-great" futures stop being rare.

**“Uniform(0,1) is Doing the Work”** — This attacks **Pivot P1** again, specifically the move from a toy product-of-uniforms model to the substantive claim that “mostly-great futures are rare even among futures which score highly across the factors on average.” The illustrative math (uniform draws, fixed N, product value) generates dramatic rarity because it bakes in that each factor is as likely to be 0.2 as 0.95 and that middling performance is common; but the essay’s own “common-sense utopia” story presumes a future where many factors are *structurally pushed near 1* by abundance, education, and coordination. If instead each relevant factor is better modeled as tightly distributed near 0.9–0.99 (or with hard floors due to robust institutions), the product doesn’t collapse; most outcomes cluster as “mostly-great,” and eutopia is not a narrow target in the paper’s sense. Put differently: the toy model’s shape is not an innocuous visualization; it is a substantive prior over how “moral factors” behave that the paper never defends. If this fails, the main conclusion (“easy eutopia likely wrong”) no longer follows; the paper would need empirical/structural reasons to expect *frequent near-zeroing factors* even under mature, safety-oriented, materially abundant civilization.
