> Many of the paper's "independent" moral catastrophes are really surface expressions of a few deep variables, so the long list of ways to fail exaggerates how narrow the target actually is.

**“Failure-Mode Double-Counting”** — The paper argues that *there are many independent ways to lose most value even in ‘common-sense utopia’* **(B)** from the claim that *diverse moral catastrophes (digital rights, population ethics, wellbeing theory, space allocation, etc.) can each independently tank value* **(A)**, because *each is treated as a distinct factor in a fragility story* **(M)**. But many of these “distinct” catastrophes are not independent factors; they are different surface forms of a smaller number of deep variables like moral status expansion, impartiality, and epistemic humility. For example, getting digital welfare “right,” population ethics “right,” and suffering tradeoffs “right” are all tightly coupled if the underlying driver is whether the civilization adopts a sentience-sensitive consequentialism (or a rights view) with strong anti-exploitation norms. If the real causal structure is low-dimensional, then the “many shots on goal to fail” picture exaggerates narrowness: you don’t need to thread 20 needles, you need to steer a few meta-principles well. This directly attacks the Section 2→2.4 inference that “lots of listed catastrophes” supports a multiplicative rarity claim, because the list’s length is doing rhetorical work it doesn’t earn. If this holds, the paper would have to either (i) argue that these dimensions stay decoupled even under reflection and institution-building, or (ii) rebuild the argument around a small number of genuinely orthogonal cruxes and show that *those* are hard to hit.
