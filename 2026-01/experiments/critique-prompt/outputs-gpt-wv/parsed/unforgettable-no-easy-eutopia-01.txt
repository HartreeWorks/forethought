> The whole "fussy vs easygoing" distinction collapses under affine rescaling of the value function, making the headline result an artifact of whichever normalisation you pick rather than a real property of moral views.

**“Affine Invariance Trap”** — The paper argues that *most plausible moral views are fussy* **(B)** from the claim that *value functions are (typically) linear-ish at scale or separably bounded in ways that make near-best outcomes narrow* **(A)**, because *we can represent each view with a cardinal \(v\) (VNM) and then compare how much probability mass lies above thresholds like \(v>0.5\)* **(M)**. But “fussiness” here is not invariant under the very affine freedom the paper foregrounds: once you allow the admissible positive affine transformations of \(v\), whether “mostly-great” occupies 1% or 50% of probability mass can be made to swing unless you fix a cross-world and cross-theory metric that is itself morally loaded. The paper tries to fix this with normalizations (extinction–best, variance, pairwise), yet later admits these flip key conclusions; that makes “fussy vs easygoing” look like an artifact of the chosen scale-setting rule rather than a property of the underlying moral ordering. If this objection holds, the headline claim “easygoingness is unlikely” can’t be stated without first defending a uniquely privileged normalization principle—and the paper’s own discussion suggests no such principle is stable across cosmology, distributional priors, and theory types. To repair the central move, the paper would need a representation-invariant definition of “narrow target” (e.g., one based on ordinal robustness, dominance regions, or permissible transformation sets) or else retreat to a strictly within-theory (non-aggregative) thesis.
