> The paper's "narrow target" conclusion hinges on treating governance challenges as independent dice rolls, but good institutions tend to get many things right at once, so failures probably cluster less than the multiplicative model suggests.

**"Independence assumptions are doing hidden work"**  
The paper repeatedly appeals to “relatively independent” factors (welfare theory, population ethics, digital rights, space allocation, etc.) to justify multiplicative compounding. Yet in realistic governance trajectories, many of these variables are strongly correlated via common causes like institutional quality, deliberation norms, and alignment/epistemics. Better institutions that handle digital minds well are also more likely to handle space property rights well; societies that reflect carefully about welfare are also likelier to adopt better population policies. Positive correlation weakens the “one miss ruins everything” distributional claim and can make “good futures cluster” more than the product model implies. Conversely, if correlation is negative (tradeoffs), the paper should model *explicit Pareto frontiers* rather than independent draws. Either way, the independence framing seems under-argued given how much it drives the “narrow target” conclusion.
