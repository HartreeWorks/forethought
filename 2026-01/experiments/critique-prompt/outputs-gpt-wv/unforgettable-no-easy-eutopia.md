1. **“Affine Invariance Trap”** — The paper argues that *most plausible moral views are fussy* **(B)** from the claim that *value functions are (typically) linear-ish at scale or separably bounded in ways that make near-best outcomes narrow* **(A)**, because *we can represent each view with a cardinal \(v\) (VNM) and then compare how much probability mass lies above thresholds like \(v>0.5\)* **(M)**. But “fussiness” here is not invariant under the very affine freedom the paper foregrounds: once you allow the admissible positive affine transformations of \(v\), whether “mostly-great” occupies 1% or 50% of probability mass can be made to swing unless you fix a cross-world and cross-theory metric that is itself morally loaded. The paper tries to fix this with normalizations (extinction–best, variance, pairwise), yet later admits these flip key conclusions; that makes “fussy vs easygoing” look like an artifact of the chosen scale-setting rule rather than a property of the underlying moral ordering. If this objection holds, the headline claim “easygoingness is unlikely” can’t be stated without first defending a uniquely privileged normalization principle—and the paper’s own discussion suggests no such principle is stable across cosmology, distributional priors, and theory types. To repair the central move, the paper would need a representation-invariant definition of “narrow target” (e.g., one based on ordinal robustness, dominance regions, or permissible transformation sets) or else retreat to a strictly within-theory (non-aggregative) thesis.

2. **“Self-Referential Best-Feasible”** — The paper argues that *a mostly-great future is a narrow target even conditional on survival* **(B)** from the claim that *“best feasible” is the 99.99th percentile of outcomes under a well-informed distribution conditional on no serious de dicto optimization* **(A)**, because *we can then ask what fraction of that same distribution exceeds \(v>0.5\) or \(v>0.9\)* **(M)**. The problem is that the definition of the benchmark (“best feasible”) bakes in the very steering variable the paper later treats as explanatory: what counts as “feasible” at the 99.99th percentile depends on institutional and epistemic dynamics, which are endogenously affected by the presence/absence of de dicto optimization pressure. In other words, you are sampling “best feasible” from a world where nobody tries very hard, and then using that as the ceiling against which “trying hard” is judged necessary—creating a ceiling that shifts upward precisely when the paper’s recommended response (deliberate optimization) is introduced. This can flip the diagnosis: the target can appear “narrow” because you defined the mountain peak using a map drawn from a society that never builds climbing gear. If this holds, much of Section 1–3’s framing (“we’re far from the ceiling of flourishing”) becomes underdetermined by the paper’s own setup. Fixing it would require defining “best feasible” in a way that is policy-invariant (e.g., conditional on an explicit class of governance/optimization regimes) or else modeling feasibility as a function of optimization effort rather than holding it fixed.

3. **“Complementarity Mirage”** — The paper argues that *single flaws can erase most value so mostly-great outcomes are rare* **(B)** from the claim that *future value is well-modeled as a product of many quasi-independent factors* **(A)**, because *multiplication makes the distribution extremely right-skewed and punishes any low-scoring dimension* **(M)**. But the product structure is doing nearly all the work, and it implicitly assumes strong complementarity: that improvements in one dimension can’t compensate for shortfalls in another in the relevant moral views. Many of the paper’s own candidate dimensions (autonomy, diversity, bliss, scale, justice) behave more like partial substitutes under pluralistic moral uncertainty: worlds can be “rescued” by being extremely good on a few decisive axes even if middling on others, which is exactly what additive or maximin/leximin hybrids capture. If moral pluralism pushes toward *portfolio* aggregation (“be very good at some things, decent at the rest”) rather than complementarity, then the skewness argument collapses and “mostly-great” can be a large basin rather than a knife-edge. This isn’t a patchable modeling tweak, because it reverses the paper’s mechanism for fragility in Section 2.4 and undermines the intuitive force of the “one flaw unwinds everything” examples. If this objection holds, the paper would need to justify complementarity as a default under the specific moral-uncertainty regime it endorses (trade/compromise), or else replace the product model with an aggregation family and show fragility across that family.

4. **“Failure-Mode Double-Counting”** — The paper argues that *there are many independent ways to lose most value even in ‘common-sense utopia’* **(B)** from the claim that *diverse moral catastrophes (digital rights, population ethics, wellbeing theory, space allocation, etc.) can each independently tank value* **(A)**, because *each is treated as a distinct factor in a fragility story* **(M)**. But many of these “distinct” catastrophes are not independent factors; they are different surface forms of a smaller number of deep variables like moral status expansion, impartiality, and epistemic humility. For example, getting digital welfare “right,” population ethics “right,” and suffering tradeoffs “right” are all tightly coupled if the underlying driver is whether the civilization adopts a sentience-sensitive consequentialism (or a rights view) with strong anti-exploitation norms. If the real causal structure is low-dimensional, then the “many shots on goal to fail” picture exaggerates narrowness: you don’t need to thread 20 needles, you need to steer a few meta-principles well. This directly attacks the Section 2→2.4 inference that “lots of listed catastrophes” supports a multiplicative rarity claim, because the list’s length is doing rhetorical work it doesn’t earn. If this holds, the paper would have to either (i) argue that these dimensions stay decoupled even under reflection and institution-building, or (ii) rebuild the argument around a small number of genuinely orthogonal cruxes and show that *those* are hard to hit.

5. **“Attractor Evidence Reversal”** — The paper argues that *historical and cross-view moral catastrophe shows eutopia is fragile and not reached by default* **(B)** from the claim that *most people historically lived amid grave moral wrongs that weren’t obvious even to victims* **(A)**, because *non-obvious severe flaws seem easy to introduce and persist* **(M)**. But that same evidence also supports a different mechanism: large moral errors often become *legible* and politically contestable as technology and coordination improve, suggesting an attractor toward expanding moral circles and reducing suffering once constraints loosen. The paper’s own “common-sense utopia” stipulates abundance, peace, and high capability—exactly the conditions that historically accelerated abolitionist, feminist, and humanitarian reforms—so the analogy cuts against the conclusion that errors persist “by default.” If moral learning is an attractor in high-capability regimes, then the relevant distribution conditional on survival is not “random drift among fussy dimensions,” but “biased drift toward correcting the biggest, most salient harms,” which widens the eutopian target. This is hard to route around with a paragraph because it challenges the direction of the core evidential arrow in Section 2.1–2.3: your motivating examples may be evidence *for* self-correction under the very conditions you later assume. If it holds, the paper needs a model of why future moral learning stalls or misfires *specifically in abundant, epistemically empowered societies*, rather than extrapolating from eras dominated by scarcity, violence, and limited information.

6. **“Fat-Tail Search Dividend”** — The paper argues that *on linear/unbounded views, a mostly-great future requires extremely specific resource uses* **(B)** from the claim that *value-per-resource is fat-tailed, so only rare configurations achieve near-max efficiency* **(A)**, because *fat tails imply most random uses are far from the top and you must hit the extreme tail to get most value* **(M)**. But fat tails also imply something the paper doesn’t price in: if civilization can run massive parallel experimentation (especially with digital labor and simulation), then the expected maximum of many draws climbs rapidly, making “rare gems” easier to find than under thin-tailed landscapes. In other words, the same heavy-tailedness that makes the average configuration mediocre can make the best-found configuration accessible via search—and advanced civilizations are exactly search machines. Under this dynamic, the narrowness of the *set* of optimal configurations doesn’t translate into a low *probability of discovering* one, so the fat-tail premise can support “easy eutopia given survival and capability” rather than its negation. This attacks a load-bearing step in Section 3.2 where “astronomical space of uses” is treated as an obstacle rather than a substrate for optimization. If this objection holds, the paper must model not just the distribution of value across configurations but also the civilization’s sampling power, exploration incentives, and meta-optimization—otherwise the fat-tail argument points the wrong way.

7. **“Separability Smuggles the Conclusion”** — The paper argues that *linear unbounded views make eutopia fussy because you must control most accessible resources and allocate them nearly optimally* **(B)** from the claim that *linear views are separable across space/time at some granularity, so each parcel contributes independently and can be replicated* **(A)**, because *separability implies additive scaling and makes missed resources unrecoverable value loss* **(M)**. Yet the separability premise quietly rules out several of the paper’s own earlier-listed mechanisms that would make “missing some resources” less catastrophic, such as acausal trade, coordination with other civilizations, or moral views where relational/structural properties (legitimacy, rights, non-domination) dominate over sheer replication of value-efficient microstructures. If what matters includes global properties (e.g., whether exploitation occurs anywhere, whether governance is legitimate, whether agents stand in certain relations), then linearity in “resources used for good stuff” does not imply separability—and the inference from “many galaxies exist” to “must personally capture them” weakens. This isn’t a generic “economics vs ethics” complaint; it targets the specific bridge in 3.2 from linearity to “one 20-billionth of value” via a replication picture. If the bridge fails, linear views might be fussy in a *different* way (rights violations) or not fussy about cosmic land-grabs at all. To fix it, the paper would need to defend separability for the morally relevant units under the candidate linear views, or explicitly show that the main results survive when value depends on non-separable global constraints.

8. **“Grain-Size Catastrophe”** — The paper argues that *separately aggregating bounded views are extremely fussy because even \(1/10^{22}\) of resources used badly ruins ‘mostly-great’* **(B)** from the claim that *with ~\(10^{22}\) star-systems, even a one-star-system equivalent of bads pushes you past half the disvalue bound* **(A)**, because *aggregation over an enormous count makes tiny fractions morally decisive* **(M)**. But this inference depends on an arbitrary moral “grain size” (star-systems as the unit) and assumes bads scale linearly and comparably across heterogeneous regions; many plausible separable-bads views instead treat bads as (i) saturating locally (there’s only so much disvalue a region can contain), (ii) morally quarantinable (isolated harms don’t contaminate global value), or (iii) dominated by worst-case pockets (so the relevant unit isn’t “one star” but “maximum suffering intensity anywhere”). Change the grain and the conclusion flips: the same civilization could look near-best if harms are strictly bounded per capita and aggressively isolated, or look hopeless if tiny pockets host astronomical suffering, regardless of fraction. The paper presents the \(10^{22}\) arithmetic as if it were structural, but it’s actually doing hidden work: picking a unit that makes “tiny fraction” translate into “huge absolute.” If this objection holds, Section 3.3’s “bads must be almost eliminated” result can’t be derived from bounded separate aggregation without a principled account of moral measure, locality, and how disvalue composes over space. To repair it, the paper would need to specify and defend a morally grounded measure over harms (intensity, duration, distribution, locality) rather than relying on star-count scaling.

9. **“Preference-Laundering Backfire”** — The paper argues that *even if everyone in a rich future gets what they self-interestedly want, the world could still miss most value* **(B)** from the claim that *future agents can engineer preferences and be content in ‘tragically mediocre’ circumstances* **(A)**, because *contentment doesn’t track objective moral value and can mask catastrophe* **(M)**. But this move undercuts the paper’s own use of “easygoing liberalism” as a serious candidate and destabilizes its treatment of preference-based wellbeing: if preference-satisfactionism is among the plausible views you’re aggregating over (and the paper treats it as a main contender), then preference engineering is not “masking” low value—it is constitutive of high value, making eutopia *easier* rather than harder. The paper tries to have it both ways: using preference-satisfactionism as a live theory in the wellbeing taxonomy, while also treating preference plasticity as evidence that apparent flourishing is unreliable. That makes the central inference from “agents can be satisfied with mediocrity” to “mostly-great is narrow” depend on already rejecting a big swath of the “plausible views” set. If this objection holds, the argument either needs to exclude preference-satisfactionist families from the plausibility class (and say why), or treat preference engineering as a *positive* lever that expands the eutopian basin for a major chunk of moral credence. The paper would have to restructure the “common-sense utopia still flawed” section to avoid relying on a diagnostic (contentment is cheap) that is itself theory-contingent in exactly the way the paper is trying to stay robust to.

10. **“Optimization Lock‑In Paradox”** — The paper argues that *because eutopia is a narrow target, hitting it likely requires deliberate de dicto optimization/steering* **(B)** from the claim that *many fussy views punish single mistakes and fat tails reward extreme optimization* **(A)**, because *more optimization pressure increases the chance of landing in the tiny near-best region* **(M)**. But in the Forethought framework this is self-undermining: the same steering instruments (centralized planning, powerful AI advisers, institutional hardening, coordinated moral projects) are exactly the mechanisms that raise lock-in and power concentration risk—failure modes that the paper itself treats as capable of erasing most value. If “fussy” means “one wrong lock-in sinks you,” then increasing optimization pressure can *increase* expected value loss by increasing the probability and irreversibility of a wrong irreversible commitment, even if it also increases the conditional quality given success. This isn’t a generic “be careful with power” worry; it directly targets the paper’s implied policy moral: “narrow target → push harder,” by showing the sign can flip once you include endogenous lock-in as part of the same fussy landscape. If this objection holds, the paper can’t simply conclude that flourishing work deserves more priority because the ceiling is high; it must model the variance/irreversibility introduced by optimization and show that the net effect is positive under the very fragility assumptions it advances. To change the argument, the paper would need to distinguish *reversible, pluralistic, error-correcting* optimization (which might widen the basin) from *centralized, lock-in-prone* optimization (which might shrink it), and then defend that the former is the realistic path.
