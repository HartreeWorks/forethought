1. **“Multiplication Smuggles in Independence”** — This attacks **Pivot P1: “the value of the future is (well-)modeled as the product of many relatively independent factors, such that doing badly on any one is enough to lose out on most value”** (load-bearing because it’s the main engine turning “many possible moral flaws” into “mostly-great futures are rare”). The paper’s product model implicitly needs *near-independence* (or at least weak correlation) between dimensions like autonomy, happiness, diversity, digital welfare, etc., yet many of these plausibly move together under the same institutional/technological drivers (e.g., better governance raises many “factors” simultaneously; oppressive lock-in lowers many simultaneously). If the factors are positively correlated, then “scoring well on average” is much more likely to coincide with “scoring well on almost all,” which collapses the claimed extreme right-skew where most futures are tiny fractions of the best. In that case, “single-flaw fragility” becomes less representative: the modal future might be “pretty good on most dimensions” rather than “excellent except for one catastrophic miss.” If this objection holds, the paper can no longer infer “no easy eutopia” from “many dimensions matter”; it would need a different, non-independence-based argument that *even given correlated progress* the remaining failure modes still dominate expected value.

2. **“Uniform(0,1) is Doing the Work”** — This attacks **Pivot P1** again, specifically the move from a toy product-of-uniforms model to the substantive claim that “mostly-great futures are rare even among futures which score highly across the factors on average.” The illustrative math (uniform draws, fixed N, product value) generates dramatic rarity because it bakes in that each factor is as likely to be 0.2 as 0.95 and that middling performance is common; but the essay’s own “common-sense utopia” story presumes a future where many factors are *structurally pushed near 1* by abundance, education, and coordination. If instead each relevant factor is better modeled as tightly distributed near 0.9–0.99 (or with hard floors due to robust institutions), the product doesn’t collapse; most outcomes cluster as “mostly-great,” and eutopia is not a narrow target in the paper’s sense. Put differently: the toy model’s shape is not an innocuous visualization; it is a substantive prior over how “moral factors” behave that the paper never defends. If this fails, the main conclusion (“easy eutopia likely wrong”) no longer follows; the paper would need empirical/structural reasons to expect *frequent near-zeroing factors* even under mature, safety-oriented, materially abundant civilization.

3. **“Bounded-But-Not-Linear: The ‘Alien Universe’ Assumption”** — This attacks **Pivot P2: “if value is bounded with respect to the universe as a whole, then because the universe is huge and full of other value, humanity’s marginal impact is tiny, so strictly concave bounded views are approximately linear in practice (therefore fussy)”** (load-bearing because it rules out a large class of easygoing bounded views by collapsing them into the “linear = fussy” bucket). The argument hinges on a strong empirical/cosmological premise: that there is vast independent value “out there” (many alien civilizations, or effectively infinite background value) making our contribution a differential rounding error. But if the Great Filter is ahead, if advanced life is rare, if most of the universe is value-empty without our expansion, or if we can causally influence a large fraction of accessible matter-lightcone, then our marginal contribution is not “small,” and bounded concavity is not locally linear over the relevant range. Under those conditions, bounded views can genuinely be non-linear in the region we control, potentially making “common-sense utopia” close to the bound and thus easygoing. If this objection holds, the paper’s classification (“bounded views mostly reduce to linear fussiness”) breaks, and the conclusion that “only a narrow slice of bounded views are easygoing” would need to be rebuilt without leaning on speculative cosmological abundance of independent value.

4. **“The 10²² Stars Move: A Units/Measure Bug”** — This attacks **Pivot P2’s** key quantitative punchline: on separate-aggregation bounded views, “even if as little as one resource in 10²² is used toward bads rather than goods, we don’t reach a mostly-great future,” making such views “obsessively” fussy. That inference assumes (i) that “one part in 10²²” corresponds to a morally comparable “star system’s worth” of bads, (ii) that the bounded transform treats that aggregate as putting you >50% toward the disvalue bound, and (iii) that “goods” and “bads” scale in commensurate units across cosmic expansion—none of which is established by the paper’s setup. In many plausible separate-aggregation specifications, the bounded function could saturate *much more slowly* for bads than the star-count heuristic implies, or the relevant “bad” might be localized and not scale linearly with captured mass/energy (e.g., a small region of rights violations doesn’t automatically equal “a star system’s worth of intense suffering”). If the mapping from “fraction of resources” to “fraction of disvalue bound” is wrong, the “tiny bad ruins mostly-great” result evaporates, and separate-aggregation bounded views may be only mildly fussy (or even easygoing). If this objection holds, the paper must replace the star-count argument with an explicit, defensible measure of how bads scale with expansion and how the bounded transform behaves over that scale—otherwise “bounded views are fussy too” is unsupported.

5. **“Fat Tails Are Asserted Where Plateaus Are Plausible”** — This attacks **Pivot P3: “for linear unbounded views, value-per-resource across uses is probably sufficiently fat-tailed that a small fraction of uses capture most value, making mostly-great futures a narrow target”** (load-bearing because it converts linearity from “needs lots of resources” into “needs very specific uses of resources,” i.e., narrowness). The cited analogies (wealth, city sizes, citations, consumer surplus) are about competitive social processes with rich-get-richer dynamics; they don’t straightforwardly transfer to “intrinsically valuable configurations of matter/experience” where there may be many broad basins of near-maximal value. The experiential-evidence offered (Russell/Dostoevsky quotes; a survey of “most intense vs second most intense”) at best suggests heavy tails in *reported intensity*, not in moral value-per-joule, and it doesn’t rule out a wide plateau where many different designs yield ~80–95% of max value-efficiency. If value-efficiency is thin-tailed or plateaued, then “very specific use” is false: many resource allocations yield mostly-great futures, and linear views no longer imply “no easy eutopia.” If this objection holds, the paper would need either a constructive model of future design space generating extreme concentration of value-efficiency (not just analogy) or else concede that linear views may be easygoing conditional on broad near-optimal sets.

6. **“Linearity ≠ A Unique Replicable Optimum”** — This attacks **Pivot P3’s** further inference: because linear views are separable, “there must be some single ‘value-efficient’ arrangement… such that… one needs to recreate as many of those arrangements as possible,” and missing that makes the target narrow. Separability implies additivity across parcels, but it does not imply that the maximizing local configuration is unique or even rare; there could be vast families of near-maximizers (symmetries, many kinds of flourishing minds, many aesthetic/cultural equilibria) whose per-resource value differs by only a few percent. In that world, a civilization can be “mostly-great” without converging on one exact pattern—it can fill space with heterogeneous but still highly value-efficient structures. If so, the paper’s “astronomical space of actions” cuts the other way: a huge space can contain huge *volumes* of near-optimal choices, not just needles. If this objection holds, the conclusion that linear views are fussy due to “very specific uses” collapses; the paper would need an argument that the near-optimal set is measure-zero/small under realistic constraints, not merely that the option space is large.

7. **“‘No De Dicto Optimization’ is Not the Default Once AI Exists”** — This attacks **Pivot P4: the operational definition of fussiness as “mostly-great futures are very unlikely on a ‘default’ distribution conditional on survival and no serious de dicto optimization pressure,”** which is load-bearing because the headline “no easy eutopia” ultimately targets what happens *without deliberate aiming*. In an AI-driven future, powerful optimization pressure arises endogenously from mundane incentives (profit, security, status, ideological competition), and that pressure will heavily shape institutions, moral discourse, and enforcement mechanisms even if nobody says “we optimize for the good de dicto.” Many of the paper’s failure modes (digital slavery, massive suffering externalities, lock-in of unreflective values) are precisely the kinds of outcomes that competitive optimization can *also* counteract if they cause instability, rebellion, inefficiency, or reputational/international conflict—so “default” may not be a low-optimization regime at all. If the true default is “strong optimization toward locally stable, widely-legible welfare/rights norms” (even if imperfect), then the probability mass on mostly-great futures rises substantially, undermining the claim that the target is narrow in practice. If this objection holds, the paper must either justify that endogenous optimization systematically pushes toward the wrong attractors (and why), or else restrict its conclusion to a contrived low-optimization counterfactual rather than the world we are actually heading toward.

8. **“Moral Disagreement ≠ Massive Value Loss”** — This attacks **Pivot P1/P4 as instantiated in Section 2’s rhetorical core: because many moral perspectives can label the present a “moral catastrophe,” a single non-obvious flaw can erase “most value” in futures that look wonderful, so easy eutopia is unlikely. The move silently equates “a view would call this deeply wrong” with “this world loses most of the value gap between extinction and eutopia,” but the paper’s own cardinalization (e.g., the 50–50 gamble test) is much more demanding than mere condemnation. Many listed perspectives (religious non-adherence, conservative sexual norms, communism’s alienation claims) plausibly imply “world is meaningfully flawed” without implying “worse than a 60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction,” which is the essay’s stated startling implication of no-easy-eutopia. If moral views typically assign large but not dominating disvalue to their “catastrophe,” then single flaws don’t generally multiply value toward zero, and the fragility premise weakens. If this objection holds, the paper must either (i) demonstrate that a large fraction of plausible views really do imply *near-total* value loss from such flaws under its own quantitative criterion, or (ii) retreat to a weaker conclusion (“many futures are meaningfully suboptimal”) that no longer supports the strategic “flourishing work dwarfs survival work” motivation that animates the broader Better Futures framing.

9. **“Moral Uncertainty Doesn’t Privilege the Fussiest Theories by Default”** — This attacks **Pivot P5: “on plausible intertheoretic comparison methods (variance normalization; pairwise reasoning), unbounded views loom larger, so aggregation under moral uncertainty is itself fussy”** (load-bearing because it tries to make “no easy eutopia” robust to not knowing the true theory). The essay’s own demonstration shows rankings flip dramatically with the normalization choice, which undercuts the later claim that the “fairest” approaches tend to weight unbounded (and thus fussy) views more; many philosophers instead use decision rules designed to avoid normalization arbitrariness (e.g., parliamentary/ bargaining models, minimax regret across theories, dominance-avoiding constraints) that do not mechanically amplify unbounded stakes. If one adopts an uncertainty framework that treats “comparability failures” as reason to avoid letting any single high-range theory dominate, then easygoing bounded views can retain substantial decision weight, and “easygoingness unlikely” no longer follows from moral uncertainty. If this objection holds, the paper must either defend a specific intertheoretic framework strongly enough that the “fussy-weighting” result is not optional, or else downgrade the robustness claim and admit that under many reasonable meta-ethical decision procedures, easy eutopia could remain a live default hypothesis.

10. **“Stochastic Dominance Isn’t a Knockdown—So ‘Easygoing Views Are Implausible’ Doesn’t Stick”** — This attacks **Pivot P2/P5** where the paper dismisses difference-making bounded views that jointly aggregate goods/bads by citing “violating stochastic dominance” and “scale-tipping,” thereby cordoning off the main easygoing family as “narrow and implausible.” Dominance violations are often treated as a cost, but not a decisive refutation, especially when the alternative is embracing extreme fanatical implications (the essay itself motivates boundedness partly to avoid linear fanatical tradeoffs). Moreover, the “scale-tipping” complaint depends on an intuition that tiny balance shifts shouldn’t flip value from near-worst to near-best—but bounded transforms are *designed* to compress extremes, so sharp phase transitions can be a feature rather than a bug depending on how moral salience is modeled. If dominance violations and tipping are tolerated (or are judged less implausible than the essay’s own linear-view fanatical comparisons), then the “narrow slice” of easygoing views is not obviously less plausible than the fussy alternatives—and the core conclusion (“easygoingness is unlikely”) loses its main eliminative step. If this objection holds, the paper would need a stronger impossibility/representation-style argument showing that any jointly aggregating bounded difference-making view that is easygoing must violate constraints we are unwilling to give up, rather than relying on contestable intuitions about dominance and tipping.
