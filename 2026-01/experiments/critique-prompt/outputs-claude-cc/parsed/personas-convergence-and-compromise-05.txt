[The Second-Order Catastrophist] Suppose the paper's recommendations succeed and society implements robust "collective decision-making processes" that prevent value-destroying threats and enable widespread moral trade. The paper fails to consider that such processes, by creating stable equilibria around current preference distributions, would lock in whatever moral errors happen to be prevalent at the time of implementation. If the decision-making apparatus is sufficiently robust to prevent threats and enable trade, it is also sufficiently robust to prevent later moral reformers from disrupting a stable but suboptimal equilibrium. The paper's own framework suggests that moral views continue to evolve with reflection; a system optimized for "trade and compromise" among current views actively prevents the disruption necessary for moral progress beyond current horizons. Success at the paper's proximate goals may guarantee failure at its ultimate goal.
