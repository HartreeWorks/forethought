**Load-bearing claim:**
That bounded-above views with separately aggregated goods and bads likely reach both bounds, yielding net-zero value (Section 3.4 analysis)

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

The paper assumes symmetric access to upper and lower bounds, but production functions for goods versus bads may be radically asymmetric. Construct a world where: (i) upper bounds require rare resources (e.g., specific computational substrates for optimal experiences), (ii) lower bounds require only common resources (e.g., any substrate can run suffering), but (iii) the rare resources needed for goods are controlled by actors who care about goods, while actors who might produce bads lack access to the common resources (because the good-caring actors got there first). In this countermodel, the goods-bound is approached while the bads-bound is not, even with separate aggregation. The paper's pessimistic conclusion requires symmetric resource access that may not hold if early coordination succeeds.
