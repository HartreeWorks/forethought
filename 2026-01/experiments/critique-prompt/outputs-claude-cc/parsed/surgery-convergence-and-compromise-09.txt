**Load-bearing claim:**
The dilemma that moral realism implies convergence-without-motivation while antirealism implies motivation-without-convergence (Claim 3)

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

Consider a world where moral realism is true but the correct view is "close" to common human intuitions—perhaps because moral facts are constituted by idealized human responses (a Cornell realist view à la Boyd). In this countermodel, the correct moral view wouldn't strike people as alien because it would be constructed from the very psychological materials they already possess. The paper treats "distance from current preferences" as monotonically increasing under realism, but constructivist or response-dependent realisms specifically anchor moral facts to human nature. If this critique holds, the paper's central pessimistic argument against WAM-convergence loses its force, since one major horn of the dilemma (realism → alienation → lack of motivation) fails.
