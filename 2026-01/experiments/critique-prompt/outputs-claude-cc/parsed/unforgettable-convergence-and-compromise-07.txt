"The Motivation-Belief Divorce That Proves Too Much": The paper argues that even if moral realism is true and people learn correct moral facts, they might not be motivated to act on them (externalism) or might avoid learning them (internalism). But this same divorce between moral knowledge and motivation would equally undermine the paper's own practical recommendations. If people systematically fail to be motivated by moral truths, why would the paper's readers—upon learning that working on "better futures" is important—actually do anything about it? The paper cannot simultaneously use motivation failures to generate pessimism about convergence while implicitly assuming its readers will be motivated by its conclusions. Either moral knowledge tends to motivate (which helps convergence) or it doesn't (which makes the paper practically inert).
