"The Convergence Bootstrapping Problem": The paper argues that partial AM-convergence plus trade can achieve a mostly-great future because those who hold correct moral views can bargain for resources. But this inference assumes that the "correct" moral view is identifiable as a stable bargaining partner before the bargaining process determines outcomes. If antirealism is true (which the paper treats as a live possibility), then what counts as the "correct" view is itself potentially determined by or sensitive to the bargaining outcomes—whoever ends up with resources may thereby have stronger claims to correctness on subjectivist frameworks. The paper cannot simultaneously hold that correctness is subjective and that we can meaningfully assess whether trade leads to "mostly-great" outcomes independent of who wins the trade. If this objection holds, the entire trade-and-compromise framework collapses into a circular justification where success validates the moral views of the successful.
