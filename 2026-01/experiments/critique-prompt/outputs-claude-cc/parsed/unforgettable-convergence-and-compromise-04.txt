"The Threat Asymmetry Assumption": The paper argues that value-destroying threats could rob trade scenarios of most value because "bads weigh more heavily than goods" and threats are cheap. But this assumes threat-makers and threat-receivers have asymmetric capacities—that it's easier to credibly threaten destruction than to credibly threaten retaliation or to build defensive capabilities. In a world of superintelligent advisors and "iron-clad contracts," the same technologies that enable credible threats also enable credible deterrence and mutual vulnerability. The paper's pessimism about threats depends on a technological asymmetry it never establishes and that seems implausible given the symmetric access to superintelligence it elsewhere assumes. If defensive and retaliatory capacities scale with offensive ones, the threat problem may be self-limiting rather than value-destroying.
