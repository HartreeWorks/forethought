**Load-bearing claim attacked: Trade can achieve near-optimal outcomes for multiple views simultaneously (Claim 4).** Attack type: Equilibrium shift. The paper assumes that views will trade as if they have fixed, exogenous preferences. But if actors know trade will occur, strategic incentives emerge to *adopt* or *signal* preferences that improve bargaining position—e.g., cultivating preferences that are cheap for others to satisfy but appear costly, or developing "tastes" for things others want to keep. Over time, the distribution of preferences itself becomes endogenous to the trading regime. This could either improve outcomes (views converge toward hybrid goods) or worsen them (views become adversarially specialized). The paper's static analysis of gains from trade ignores this dynamic, meaning its optimistic scenarios may be unstable equilibria that unravel once actors anticipate bargaining.
