"The Resource-Compatibility Concept Remains Underspecified" — The paper introduces "resource-compatibility" as crucial to whether moral trade can achieve mostly-great futures, defining it as views being satisfiable with the same resources. However, the concept receives insufficient analysis. The authors claim that "resource-compatibility between linear views seems unlikely" without systematic argument, and the "narcissism of small differences" effect is illustrated with one example rather than demonstrated as a general phenomenon. Given that the paper's conclusions about trade depend heavily on resource-compatibility being rare among plausible moral views, this underspecification represents a significant gap.
