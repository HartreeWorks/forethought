"The Selection Effect Timing Dodge": The paper acknowledges that "non-discounting values might win out over time" through asymmetric growth but dismisses this because "the major decisions are made soon." This timing claim does enormous load-bearing work but receives no defense. Why should we expect major decisions to be made before selection effects operate? The paper elsewhere emphasizes uncertainty about how post-AGI society will be structured and governed. If we're uncertain about institutional forms, we should be equally uncertain about decision timing. The paper's pessimism here depends on a confident empirical prediction about the speed of lock-in relative to the speed of value selection—a prediction that seems no more justified than its negation.
