**Load-bearing claim attacked: Scenario (3) deserves more decision weight because actions have higher impact there (supports Claim 8).** Attack type: Parameter sensitivity. The paper's argument compares "increasing personal power 100-fold in scenario (1)" against "increasing survival probability by 1/100,000 in scenario (3)." But both parameters are arbitrary. Why 100-fold and not 10,000-fold? Why 1/100,000 and not 1/10,000,000? The conclusion about which scenario deserves more weight is entirely determined by these parameter choices, which are defended only by the vague claim that readers probably can't "enormously multiply" their power. This makes the practical recommendation (don't power-seek, work on flourishing) rest on underdetermined empirical claims about tractability that the paper never investigates. Different plausible parameter values reverse the conclusion.
