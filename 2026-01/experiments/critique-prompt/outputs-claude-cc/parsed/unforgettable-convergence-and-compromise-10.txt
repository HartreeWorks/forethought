"The Subjectivist Self-Defeat": The paper argues that subjectivists shouldn't expect convergence because different idealizing processes would lead to different conclusions, and there's no objective fact about which process is correct. But subjectivism, consistently applied, also implies there's no objective fact about whether "mostly-great futures" are actually better than alternatives. On subjectivism, the paper's entire concern about reaching mostly-great futures is just an expression of the authors' preferences, with no more claim to attention than anyone else's preferences for different futures. The paper argues against convergence using subjectivist premises while its normative force depends entirely on readers sharing something like the authors' preferences—which subjectivism gives us no reason to expect. If subjectivism defeats convergence, it equally defeats caring about the paper's conclusions.
