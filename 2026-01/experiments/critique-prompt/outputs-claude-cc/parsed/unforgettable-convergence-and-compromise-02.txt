"The Alien Experience Escape Hatch": The paper argues that even meta-ethical hedonism combined with welfarism won't guarantee a mostly-great future because "the very best experiences are so alien that most people initially pursuing their self-interest cannot themselves experience them." But this same argument undermines the paper's earlier pessimism about convergence. If the best experiences are incomprehensible to current humans, then the paper's claims about how "narrow" the target of a mostly-great future is become unfounded—we literally cannot assess the width of a target we cannot conceptualize. The paper uses alien-experience arguments opportunistically: to defeat optimistic scenarios while preserving its pessimistic framing. Either we can reason about the space of possible valuable futures (in which case alien experiences don't defeat convergence arguments) or we cannot (in which case the "narrow target" thesis is itself unjustified).
