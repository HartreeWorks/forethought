"Inconsistent Treatment of Superintelligent Reflection" — The paper offers contradictory assessments of AI-assisted moral reflection. Section 2.3.1 acknowledges that superintelligence could "radically increase" reflection capabilities and might "finally settle those stubborn puzzles of ethics." Yet the authors then dismiss this possibility primarily by noting that people might not want to learn or follow such conclusions. This response conflates two distinct questions: whether superintelligent reflection would yield convergent answers, and whether people would be motivated by those answers. The paper's pessimism about the latter doesn't address the former, yet both claims are needed to dismiss AI-assisted convergence entirely.
