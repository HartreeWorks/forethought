"The Random Walk Metaphor's Hidden Assumptions" — The paper uses a "random walk" visualization to argue that moral reflection will cause views to diverge rather than converge. This metaphor smuggles in the assumption that moral reflection is fundamentally directionless or arbitrary—that each step in reflection is essentially random with respect to truth. But this begs the question against the possibility that moral reasoning, like scientific reasoning, might have truth-tracking properties that create convergent pressures. The authors provide no argument for why moral reflection should be modeled as random rather than as approximating some attractor, making this a tendentious choice of framing rather than a neutral illustration.
