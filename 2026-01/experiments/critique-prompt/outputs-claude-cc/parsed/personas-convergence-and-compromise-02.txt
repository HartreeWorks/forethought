[The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper's section 3.1 on moral trade assumes that parties will actually execute trades that make both better off by their lights, but ignores that any party holding non-discounting linear preferences has overwhelming incentive to defect on long-term cooperative arrangements. If Alice commits resources now for Bob's promise of future returns, and enforcement mechanisms are imperfect over cosmic timescales, Bob's dominant strategy is to accept Alice's resources and renege once enforcement becomes costly or impossible. The paper acknowledges superintelligence could enable "iron-clad contracts" but provides no mechanism for how contracts spanning billions of years across galactic distances would be enforced when the enforcing party itself might have drifted in values or ceased to exist. The entire edifice of optimism from moral trade collapses once you recognize that patient actors with linear utility functions face repeated prisoner's dilemmas with astronomical stakes and no credible commitment technology.
