**Load-bearing claim:**
Self-interest alone is insufficient for mostly-great futures (Claim 7)

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

Construct a world where (i) hedonism about wellbeing is correct, (ii) the hedonic value of experiences is discoverable through experience itself, and (iii) the cheapest way to produce hedonic value is also the most compelling to self-interested actors (because experiencing it makes you want more). In this world, self-interested optimization converges on the correct moral target without anyone aiming at "the good de dicto." The paper dismisses this by asserting that "the very best experiences are so alien that most people initially pursuing their self-interest cannot themselves experience them." But this is an empirical claim presented without evidence. If the best experiences are continuous with current human experience rather than discontinuous, the paper's dismissal fails, and the "accidental utopia" path remains open.
