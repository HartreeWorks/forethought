"The Flourishing Denominator Problem": The paper's key claim that we're "far from the ceiling on Flourishing" depends on defining that ceiling. But if the correct moral view is (as the paper suggests possible) unbounded above and linear in resources, there is no ceiling—Flourishing approaches infinity as resources approach infinity. In that case, saying we're at "5-10%" of potential Flourishing is meaningless; any finite value is 0% of infinity. The paper's quantitative framing presupposes bounded value while its philosophical analysis treats unbounded value as a live possibility. If unbounded views are correct, the entire framework of "percentage of potential value captured" becomes incoherent, and with it the paper's central thesis about the scale of the problem.
