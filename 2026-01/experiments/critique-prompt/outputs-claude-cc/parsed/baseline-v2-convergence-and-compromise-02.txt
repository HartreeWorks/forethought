"The Narrow Target Assumption Imported Without Argument" — The entire paper assumes the conclusion of the previous essay—that mostly-great futures constitute a "narrow target"—but never independently defends this premise within the current work. Readers who find that prior argument unpersuasive are given no reason to accept the foundational assumption here. The paper repeatedly invokes the narrow target claim (e.g., "if a mostly-great future is a narrow target") as if established fact. This makes the current essay's conclusions wholly dependent on a contested empirical and philosophical claim that receives no scrutiny, creating a significant argumentative gap for readers approaching this essay independently.
