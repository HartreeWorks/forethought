"The Underdeveloped Meta-Ethical Dilemma" — The paper's central argument in section 2.4 presents a dilemma between moral realism and antirealism, claiming both lead to pessimism about WAM-convergence. However, the authors never adequately defend their exhaustive framing of meta-ethical possibilities. They acknowledge that "academic philosophers often refer to subjectivism as a form of realism" but proceed as if their realism/antirealism distinction carves nature at its joints. Constructivist positions, error theory, and various hybrid views receive no treatment, yet could yield very different predictions about convergence. The argument's force depends entirely on this binary being comprehensive, which remains undefended.
