[The Resource Economist] The paper's section 3.1 claims that transaction costs would be "extremely small relative to the gains" from moral trade in a technologically advanced society, but this ignores the fundamental problem of preference elicitation at cosmic scales. To execute trades between moral views, parties must accurately specify their utility functions over astronomically large outcome spaces, verify that counterparties have accurately specified theirs, and compute whether proposed trades actually satisfy both. The computational and communication costs of specifying preferences over 10^80 atoms worth of possible configurations, even with superintelligent assistance, scale with the complexity of the preference space, not with available compute. The paper assumes preferences can be cheaply communicated and verified, but for the kind of fine-grained moral views the paper itself argues are necessary for a "mostly-great future," the costs of specification alone may consume most available resources, leaving nothing to actually trade.
