"Tension Between Convergence Pessimism and Trade Optimism" — The paper argues in section 2 that convergence is unlikely because different idealizing processes will lead people to radically different conclusions about fine-grained ethical questions. Yet section 3's optimism about moral trade requires that parties can identify mutually beneficial arrangements, which presupposes sufficient mutual comprehension of each other's values. If views truly diverge as radically as section 2 suggests—toward "alien" preferences and incomprehensible value systems—it becomes unclear how parties could even negotiate trades or verify compliance. The paper never reconciles how views can be too divergent for convergence yet sufficiently mutually intelligible for complex moral trade.
