The paper uses the Wright brothers' achievement of powered flight as an analogy for how humanity might "hone in" on a narrow target despite astronomical odds. But the history of aviation actually undermines this analogy: the Wright brothers succeeded because they could iterate rapidly with cheap prototypes, receive immediate feedback about whether their designs flew, and learn from observable failure modes. Moral convergence toward a "mostly-great future" has none of these properties—there is no cheap way to test cosmic-scale value systems, no immediate feedback about whether one is approaching moral truth, and catastrophic moral errors may be indistinguishable from success for centuries. A better historical parallel is the history of religious and ideological movements, where confident claims of moral truth proliferated without convergence, and apparent consensus repeatedly fractured under pressure. The aviation metaphor systematically misleads about the epistemics of the actual problem.
