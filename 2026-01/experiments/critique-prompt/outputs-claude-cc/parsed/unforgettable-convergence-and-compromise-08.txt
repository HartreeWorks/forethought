"The Common-Sense Utopia Contradiction": The paper's previous essay apparently argued that "common-sense utopia achieves most possible value" on common-sense views, and this essay uses that as an example of potential gains from trade with total utilitarians. But if common-sense morality is correct and common-sense utopia achieves most value, then the "narrow target" thesis is false for most people—they're already aimed roughly correctly. The paper wants common-sense to be simultaneously (a) close enough to correct that common-sense utopia is highly valuable, justifying trade scenarios, but (b) far enough from correct that convergence is unlikely and the target is narrow. These requirements pull in opposite directions. Either common-sense is a good guide (making convergence more likely) or it isn't (making the trade scenarios less valuable).
