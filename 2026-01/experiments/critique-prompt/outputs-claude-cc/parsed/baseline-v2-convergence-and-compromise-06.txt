"The Threats Analysis Lacks Empirical Grounding" — Section 3.3 raises value-destroying threats as a major obstacle to beneficial futures through moral trade, yet the authors explicitly acknowledge they "have not particularly dug into this issue." The paper treats the threat problem as potentially catastrophic—capable of rendering futures "worse than extinction"—while providing no empirical evidence about the likelihood of such threats materializing, their expected magnitude, or historical precedents. This transforms a speculative worry into a load-bearing element of the paper's pessimistic conclusions without the evidential support such weight requires.
