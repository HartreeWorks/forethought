"The Scenario Analysis Privileges Particular Probability Weightings" — Section 5 argues readers should focus on scenario (3)—broad convergence—rather than scenario (1)—no convergence—because actions have higher impact in (3). But this conclusion depends on specific probability assignments and impact estimates that receive no defense. The claim that one can "increase the chance of Surviving by more than one part in a hundred thousand" in scenario (3) is asserted without argument. The paper's practical recommendations thus rest on probability estimates and counterfactual impact claims that are presented as if self-evident rather than as contestable empirical judgments requiring justification.
