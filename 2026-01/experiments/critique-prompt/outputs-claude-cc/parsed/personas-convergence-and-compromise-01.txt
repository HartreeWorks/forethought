The paper claims that "asymmetric growth might systematically favour altruistic values" because altruists save more and have more children, leading to their values dominating over time. This lacks any identified causal mechanism explaining *how* altruistic preferences transmit across generations or why they wouldn't be diluted by cultural mixing, assortative mating with non-altruists, or simple preference drift during child-rearing. The authors provide no falsifiable prediction about the timescale over which this selection effect would operate, no empirical evidence that altruists actually do save more or reproduce more in current populations, and no model of the selection coefficient required to overcome countervailing pressures. Without these, the claim is unfalsifiable speculation dressed as evolutionary reasoning, and the paper cannot legitimately use it as grounds for even modest optimism about future value convergence.
