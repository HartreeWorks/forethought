[The Mechanism Designer] The paper repeatedly invokes "collective decision-making processes" and "bargaining" as potential paths to mostly-great futures without ever specifying what these mechanisms actually look like. Section 3.5 casually mentions that "some such processes might well be predictably much better than others" but provides zero formal specification of any mechanism, no analysis of incentive compatibility, no discussion of what information is required for these mechanisms to function, and no proof that any mechanism satisfying reasonable participation constraints could even theoretically aggregate heterogeneous preferences over cosmic-scale resource allocation. Until the authors can write down a mechanism in mathematical form that provably achieves their claimed outcomes under stated assumptions, the phrase "trade and compromise" is doing load-bearing work that cannot be evaluated. This isn't a research contribution; it's a promissory note.
