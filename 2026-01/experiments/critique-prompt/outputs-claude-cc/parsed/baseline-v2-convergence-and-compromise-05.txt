"The Abundance Argument's Selective Application" — Section 2.3.2 argues that economic abundance would cause altruistic preferences to dominate because self-interested preferences face diminishing returns while altruistic ones don't. The authors then counter this by noting that self-interested preferences could also be linear (e.g., wanting more copies of oneself). However, this counter-argument could equally undermine their earlier claims about why non-discounting values might "win out" in section 2.3.3. The paper inconsistently treats the abundance argument as weak evidence for altruistic convergence while treating the asymmetric growth argument as providing meaningful support for long-term optimism, despite both facing similar objections.
