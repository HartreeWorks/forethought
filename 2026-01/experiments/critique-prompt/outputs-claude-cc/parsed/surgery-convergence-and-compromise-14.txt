**Load-bearing claim:**
The "resource compatibility" framework for analyzing trade gains (supports Claim 4)

**Attack type:**
Reference class failure

The paper draws on standard economic intuitions about gains from trade, but moral trade differs fundamentally from commodity trade. In commodity trade, both parties receive fungible goods they can use however they wish. In moral trade, you receive *outcomes in the world* that you cannot repurpose. If I trade for "a galaxy run according to my values," I cannot later liquidate that galaxy for something else. This illiquidity means that optimal trade portfolios in moral trade may look nothing like optimal portfolios in commodity trade. The paper's optimism about gains from trade relies on transferring intuitions from a reference class (economic exchange) where key structural features (fungibility, liquidity, price discovery) don't apply.
