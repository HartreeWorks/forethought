**Load-bearing claim attacked: Value-destroying threats could eliminate most gains from trade (Claim 5).** Attack type: Causal reversal. The paper argues threat capacity makes the future fragile, but the same mechanism could make it robust. If every party can credibly threaten mutual destruction, this creates strong incentives for establishing and maintaining norms against threats—essentially, mutually assured destruction as a coordination device. The historical evidence the paper might cite (nuclear deterrence) actually supports stability rather than executed threats. Moreover, parties with genuinely altruistic preferences would have *less* credible threats (they wouldn't want to execute them), making them poor extortion targets. The same evidence—that threats are cheap to make—equally supports the conclusion that counter-threat capabilities will proliferate, establishing deterrent equilibria rather than exploitation cascades.
