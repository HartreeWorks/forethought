[The Political Economist] The paper treats "concentration of power" as merely one "blocker" among several in section 3.5, but fails to analyze the political economy of who benefits from the status quo and who would benefit from the proposed interventions. The current distribution of power strongly favors those who would lose from genuine moral progress—those benefiting from factory farming, those whose wealth depends on preventing redistribution, those whose status depends on maintaining current hierarchies. These actors have concentrated interests in blocking convergence toward views that would disadvantage them, while the beneficiaries of moral progress (future persons, animals, digital minds) cannot organize or lobby. The paper's recommendations to improve "collective decision-making processes" will be captured by exactly those actors who benefit from current moral failures, ensuring that any implemented version serves incumbent interests while wearing the legitimizing language of moral progress.
