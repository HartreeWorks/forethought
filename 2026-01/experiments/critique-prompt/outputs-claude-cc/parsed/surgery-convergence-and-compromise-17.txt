**Load-bearing claim attacked: The paper's framing that "distance from current preferences" under realism makes motivation unlikely (supports Claim 1 and 3).** Attack type: Causal reversal. The paper assumes that if the correct moral view is "alien," people won't be motivated by it. But alienness might *increase* motivation rather than decrease it. Religious and ideological movements throughout history have motivated extraordinary sacrifices precisely by offering visions that transcend mundane self-interest. The appeal of "something greater than yourself" is well-documented. If learning the correct moral view involves a kind of conversion experience—where the very alienness provides motivational force through awe, meaning, or transcendence—then the realist horn of the dilemma points toward motivation rather than away from it. The paper never considers that alienness and motivation could be positively correlated.
