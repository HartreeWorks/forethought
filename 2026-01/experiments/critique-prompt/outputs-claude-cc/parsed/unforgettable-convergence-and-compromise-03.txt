"The Memetic Selection Reversal": The paper worries that "ideas might be so memetically potent that merely considering the idea makes an individual highly likely to adopt it" as a blocker to good outcomes. But if memetic fitness can diverge from truth, the same logic applies to the paper's own pessimistic conclusions about convergence. Perhaps the reason readers find "no easy eutopia" compelling is precisely because pessimism about coordination is memetically fit in academic contexts—it signals sophistication, avoids naive optimism, and creates demand for more research. The paper provides no way to distinguish its own arguments from memetically successful but false ideas, yet treats memetic hazards as asymmetrically threatening to optimistic views. If this objection holds, the paper needs a meta-level account of why its own reasoning escapes the memetic selection pressures it identifies.
