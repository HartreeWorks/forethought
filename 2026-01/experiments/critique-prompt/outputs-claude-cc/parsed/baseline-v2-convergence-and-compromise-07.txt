"Overgeneralization from Contemporary Billionaire Behavior" — The paper cites current billionaire philanthropy rates (approximately 6% of income) as evidence against abundance leading to increased altruism. However, contemporary billionaires exist in a world with radically different conditions than the post-AGI scenario under discussion: they lack superintelligent advisors, face genuine uncertainty about charitable effectiveness, operate under social norms shaped by scarcity, and haven't undergone the kind of enhanced reflection the paper elsewhere discusses. Extrapolating from current behavior to post-AGI scenarios commits a significant scope limitation, treating contingent features of our current situation as invariant psychological facts.
