"The Random Walk Misdirection": The paper's diagram showing moral reflection as a "random walk" that causes views to diverge assumes that reflection is directionless—that steps away from a shared starting point are equally likely in all directions. But the paper also claims (in section 2.3.1) that superintelligent reflection could introduce "arguments and considerations that human beings might never have thought of." If such arguments exist and have any rational force, reflection isn't random—it's biased toward wherever those arguments point. The random walk model is incompatible with the existence of genuinely better moral arguments. The paper deploys whichever model suits its local argumentative purpose: random walks when arguing against convergence, and the possibility of better arguments when discussing superintelligent advice. It cannot coherently maintain both.
