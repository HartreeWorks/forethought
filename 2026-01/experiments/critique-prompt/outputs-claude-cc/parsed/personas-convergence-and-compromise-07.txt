[The Complexity Theorist] The paper's analysis of moral trade in section 3.2 treats different moral views as static positions that can be straightforwardly combined or traded between. This ignores that moral views embedded in social systems exhibit emergent properties that cannot be predicted from the views in isolation. When classical utilitarian communities interact with deontological communities through trade, the resulting hybrid institutions will develop their own internal dynamics, selection pressures, and drift patterns that neither founding view anticipated or endorsed. The paper's neat partition where "the first group turns the Milky Way into a common-sense utopia, and the second group occupies all the other accessible galaxies" assumes these systems can remain isolated, but any interaction at the boundary creates a complex adaptive system whose long-run behavior is fundamentally unpredictable from initial conditions. The clean separation required for the optimistic scenario is dynamically unstable.
