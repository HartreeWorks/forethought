**Load-bearing claim:**
Non-discounting, linear-in-resources views will dominate future resource allocation (Claim 6)

**Attack type:**
Quantitative cliff

The paper's "long views win" argument assumes continuous compounding over indefinite timescales. But if there are discrete "decision windows"—periods where the trajectory of civilization is determined—then patient capital accumulation is worthless if you miss the window. The paper itself emphasizes lock-in and path dependence. If the key decisions happen before patient accumulators achieve dominance, their strategy fails precisely when it matters most. There may be a cliff at some timescale T: patient strategies dominate for decisions made after T, but impatient actors control decisions made before T, and T is when lock-in occurs. The paper cannot assume its selection argument operates on the relevant timescale without establishing that timescale empirically.
