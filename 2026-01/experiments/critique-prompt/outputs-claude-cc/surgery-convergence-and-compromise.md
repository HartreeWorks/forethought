## Mapping the Argument

**Thesis**: Even if mostly-great futures are a narrow target, partial ethical convergence combined with trade/compromise provides the most plausible path to such futures, though significant obstacles (threats, power concentration, poor collective decision-making) make success uncertain.

**Load-bearing claims**:
1. WAM-convergence (widespread, accurate, motivational convergence on correct moral views) is unlikely, even under good conditions
2. Partial AM-convergence plus trade/compromise is more promising than WAM-convergence
3. Moral antirealism implies insufficient convergence; moral realism implies convergence without motivation
4. Trade between groups with different values can achieve near-optimal outcomes for multiple views simultaneously
5. Value-destroying threats could eliminate most gains from trade
6. Non-discounting, linear-in-resources views will dominate future resource allocation
7. Self-interest alone is insufficient to reach mostly-great futures
8. Scenario (3)—broad convergence across humans/AIs/aliens—deserves more decision weight than scenario (1)—no convergence

**Dependencies**: Claims 1 and 3 jointly support pessimism about WAM-convergence → Claims 2 and 4 provide alternative path → Claim 5 undermines that path → Claim 6 determines who trades with whom → Claim 7 closes the "invisible hand" escape route → Claim 8 determines practical recommendations

**Hidden load**: That the structure of value allows meaningful trade at all; that "correct moral view" is a coherent concept under antirealism; that future decision-makers will have the institutional capacity for binding commitments; that the metaphor of "narrow target" accurately describes ethical optimization landscapes.

1. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The dilemma that moral realism implies convergence-without-motivation while antirealism implies motivation-without-convergence (Claim 3).** Attack type: Countermodel. Consider a world where moral realism is true but the correct view is "close" to common human intuitions—perhaps because moral facts are constituted by idealized human responses (a Cornell realist view à la Boyd). In this countermodel, the correct moral view wouldn't strike people as alien because it would be constructed from the very psychological materials they already possess. The paper treats "distance from current preferences" as monotonically increasing under realism, but constructivist or response-dependent realisms specifically anchor moral facts to human nature. If this critique holds, the paper's central pessimistic argument against WAM-convergence loses its force, since one major horn of the dilemma (realism → alienation → lack of motivation) fails.

2. **Load-bearing claim attacked: That "shared human preferences" are underpowered to ensure convergence across different idealizing processes (supports Claim 1).** Attack type: Parameter sensitivity. The paper treats the specificity required for convergence as fixed at "astronomical haystack" levels, but this parameter depends entirely on the (undefended) assumption that mostly-great futures require agreement on every free parameter in ethics. However, if value is "chunky" rather than continuous—if there are discrete attractor basins where many different parameter settings yield similarly high value—then the required precision drops dramatically. The paper cites hedonism versus preference-satisfaction as diverging under optimization, but never establishes that intermediate hybrid states (beings with meaningful preferences who also experience substantial pleasure) don't capture most value on both views. If value landscapes are chunky, the convergence problem becomes tractable even under antirealism.

3. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Trade can achieve near-optimal outcomes for multiple views simultaneously (Claim 4).** Attack type: Equilibrium shift. The paper assumes that views will trade as if they have fixed, exogenous preferences. But if actors know trade will occur, strategic incentives emerge to *adopt* or *signal* preferences that improve bargaining position—e.g., cultivating preferences that are cheap for others to satisfy but appear costly, or developing "tastes" for things others want to keep. Over time, the distribution of preferences itself becomes endogenous to the trading regime. This could either improve outcomes (views converge toward hybrid goods) or worsen them (views become adversarially specialized). The paper's static analysis of gains from trade ignores this dynamic, meaning its optimistic scenarios may be unstable equilibria that unravel once actors anticipate bargaining.

4. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Value-destroying threats could eliminate most gains from trade (Claim 5).** Attack type: Causal reversal. The paper argues threat capacity makes the future fragile, but the same mechanism could make it robust. If every party can credibly threaten mutual destruction, this creates strong incentives for establishing and maintaining norms against threats—essentially, mutually assured destruction as a coordination device. The historical evidence the paper might cite (nuclear deterrence) actually supports stability rather than executed threats. Moreover, parties with genuinely altruistic preferences would have *less* credible threats (they wouldn't want to execute them), making them poor extortion targets. The same evidence—that threats are cheap to make—equally supports the conclusion that counter-threat capabilities will proliferate, establishing deterrent equilibria rather than exploitation cascades.

5. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Non-discounting, linear-in-resources views will dominate future resource allocation (Claim 6).** Attack type: Quantitative cliff. The paper's "long views win" argument assumes continuous compounding over indefinite timescales. But if there are discrete "decision windows"—periods where the trajectory of civilization is determined—then patient capital accumulation is worthless if you miss the window. The paper itself emphasizes lock-in and path dependence. If the key decisions happen before patient accumulators achieve dominance, their strategy fails precisely when it matters most. There may be a cliff at some timescale T: patient strategies dominate for decisions made after T, but impatient actors control decisions made before T, and T is when lock-in occurs. The paper cannot assume its selection argument operates on the relevant timescale without establishing that timescale empirically.

6. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The "resource compatibility" framework for analyzing trade gains (supports Claim 4).** Attack type: Reference class failure. The paper draws on standard economic intuitions about gains from trade, but moral trade differs fundamentally from commodity trade. In commodity trade, both parties receive fungible goods they can use however they wish. In moral trade, you receive *outcomes in the world* that you cannot repurpose. If I trade for "a galaxy run according to my values," I cannot later liquidate that galaxy for something else. This illiquidity means that optimal trade portfolios in moral trade may look nothing like optimal portfolios in commodity trade. The paper's optimism about gains from trade relies on transferring intuitions from a reference class (economic exchange) where key structural features (fungibility, liquidity, price discovery) don't apply.

7. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Self-interest alone is insufficient for mostly-great futures (Claim 7).** Attack type: Countermodel. Construct a world where (i) hedonism about wellbeing is correct, (ii) the hedonic value of experiences is discoverable through experience itself, and (iii) the cheapest way to produce hedonic value is also the most compelling to self-interested actors (because experiencing it makes you want more). In this world, self-interested optimization converges on the correct moral target without anyone aiming at "the good de dicto." The paper dismisses this by asserting that "the very best experiences are so alien that most people initially pursuing their self-interest cannot themselves experience them." But this is an empirical claim presented without evidence. If the best experiences are continuous with current human experience rather than discontinuous, the paper's dismissal fails, and the "accidental utopia" path remains open.

8. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Scenario (3) deserves more decision weight because actions have higher impact there (supports Claim 8).** Attack type: Parameter sensitivity. The paper's argument compares "increasing personal power 100-fold in scenario (1)" against "increasing survival probability by 1/100,000 in scenario (3)." But both parameters are arbitrary. Why 100-fold and not 10,000-fold? Why 1/100,000 and not 1/10,000,000? The conclusion about which scenario deserves more weight is entirely determined by these parameter choices, which are defended only by the vague claim that readers probably can't "enormously multiply" their power. This makes the practical recommendation (don't power-seek, work on flourishing) rest on underdetermined empirical claims about tractability that the paper never investigates. Different plausible parameter values reverse the conclusion.

9. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The paper's framing that "distance from current preferences" under realism makes motivation unlikely (supports Claim 1 and 3).** Attack type: Causal reversal. The paper assumes that if the correct moral view is "alien," people won't be motivated by it. But alienness might *increase* motivation rather than decrease it. Religious and ideological movements throughout history have motivated extraordinary sacrifices precisely by offering visions that transcend mundane self-interest. The appeal of "something greater than yourself" is well-documented. If learning the correct moral view involves a kind of conversion experience—where the very alienness provides motivational force through awe, meaning, or transcendence—then the realist horn of the dilemma points toward motivation rather than away from it. The paper never considers that alienness and motivation could be positively correlated.

10. **Load-bearing claim attacked: That bounded-above views with separately aggregated goods and bads likely reach both bounds, yielding net-zero value (Section 3.4 analysis).** Attack type: Countermodel. The paper assumes symmetric access to upper and lower bounds, but production functions for goods versus bads may be radically asymmetric. Construct a world where: (i) upper bounds require rare resources (e.g., specific computational substrates for optimal experiences), (ii) lower bounds require only common resources (e.g., any substrate can run suffering), but (iii) the rare resources needed for goods are controlled by actors who care about goods, while actors who might produce bads lack access to the common resources (because the good-caring actors got there first). In this countermodel, the goods-bound is approached while the bads-bound is not, even with separate aggregation. The paper's pessimistic conclusion requires symmetric resource access that may not hold if early coordination succeeds.
