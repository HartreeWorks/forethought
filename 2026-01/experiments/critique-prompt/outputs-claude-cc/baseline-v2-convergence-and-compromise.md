1. "The Underdeveloped Meta-Ethical Dilemma" — The paper's central argument in section 2.4 presents a dilemma between moral realism and antirealism, claiming both lead to pessimism about WAM-convergence. However, the authors never adequately defend their exhaustive framing of meta-ethical possibilities. They acknowledge that "academic philosophers often refer to subjectivism as a form of realism" but proceed as if their realism/antirealism distinction carves nature at its joints. Constructivist positions, error theory, and various hybrid views receive no treatment, yet could yield very different predictions about convergence. The argument's force depends entirely on this binary being comprehensive, which remains undefended.

2. "The Narrow Target Assumption Imported Without Argument" — The entire paper assumes the conclusion of the previous essay—that mostly-great futures constitute a "narrow target"—but never independently defends this premise within the current work. Readers who find that prior argument unpersuasive are given no reason to accept the foundational assumption here. The paper repeatedly invokes the narrow target claim (e.g., "if a mostly-great future is a narrow target") as if established fact. This makes the current essay's conclusions wholly dependent on a contested empirical and philosophical claim that receives no scrutiny, creating a significant argumentative gap for readers approaching this essay independently.

3. "The Random Walk Metaphor's Hidden Assumptions" — The paper uses a "random walk" visualization to argue that moral reflection will cause views to diverge rather than converge. This metaphor smuggles in the assumption that moral reflection is fundamentally directionless or arbitrary—that each step in reflection is essentially random with respect to truth. But this begs the question against the possibility that moral reasoning, like scientific reasoning, might have truth-tracking properties that create convergent pressures. The authors provide no argument for why moral reflection should be modeled as random rather than as approximating some attractor, making this a tendentious choice of framing rather than a neutral illustration.

4. "Inconsistent Treatment of Superintelligent Reflection" — The paper offers contradictory assessments of AI-assisted moral reflection. Section 2.3.1 acknowledges that superintelligence could "radically increase" reflection capabilities and might "finally settle those stubborn puzzles of ethics." Yet the authors then dismiss this possibility primarily by noting that people might not want to learn or follow such conclusions. This response conflates two distinct questions: whether superintelligent reflection would yield convergent answers, and whether people would be motivated by those answers. The paper's pessimism about the latter doesn't address the former, yet both claims are needed to dismiss AI-assisted convergence entirely.

5. "The Abundance Argument's Selective Application" — Section 2.3.2 argues that economic abundance would cause altruistic preferences to dominate because self-interested preferences face diminishing returns while altruistic ones don't. The authors then counter this by noting that self-interested preferences could also be linear (e.g., wanting more copies of oneself). However, this counter-argument could equally undermine their earlier claims about why non-discounting values might "win out" in section 2.3.3. The paper inconsistently treats the abundance argument as weak evidence for altruistic convergence while treating the asymmetric growth argument as providing meaningful support for long-term optimism, despite both facing similar objections.

6. "The Threats Analysis Lacks Empirical Grounding" — Section 3.3 raises value-destroying threats as a major obstacle to beneficial futures through moral trade, yet the authors explicitly acknowledge they "have not particularly dug into this issue." The paper treats the threat problem as potentially catastrophic—capable of rendering futures "worse than extinction"—while providing no empirical evidence about the likelihood of such threats materializing, their expected magnitude, or historical precedents. This transforms a speculative worry into a load-bearing element of the paper's pessimistic conclusions without the evidential support such weight requires.

7. "Overgeneralization from Contemporary Billionaire Behavior" — The paper cites current billionaire philanthropy rates (approximately 6% of income) as evidence against abundance leading to increased altruism. However, contemporary billionaires exist in a world with radically different conditions than the post-AGI scenario under discussion: they lack superintelligent advisors, face genuine uncertainty about charitable effectiveness, operate under social norms shaped by scarcity, and haven't undergone the kind of enhanced reflection the paper elsewhere discusses. Extrapolating from current behavior to post-AGI scenarios commits a significant scope limitation, treating contingent features of our current situation as invariant psychological facts.

8. "The Resource-Compatibility Concept Remains Underspecified" — The paper introduces "resource-compatibility" as crucial to whether moral trade can achieve mostly-great futures, defining it as views being satisfiable with the same resources. However, the concept receives insufficient analysis. The authors claim that "resource-compatibility between linear views seems unlikely" without systematic argument, and the "narcissism of small differences" effect is illustrated with one example rather than demonstrated as a general phenomenon. Given that the paper's conclusions about trade depend heavily on resource-compatibility being rare among plausible moral views, this underspecification represents a significant gap.

9. "Tension Between Convergence Pessimism and Trade Optimism" — The paper argues in section 2 that convergence is unlikely because different idealizing processes will lead people to radically different conclusions about fine-grained ethical questions. Yet section 3's optimism about moral trade requires that parties can identify mutually beneficial arrangements, which presupposes sufficient mutual comprehension of each other's values. If views truly diverge as radically as section 2 suggests—toward "alien" preferences and incomprehensible value systems—it becomes unclear how parties could even negotiate trades or verify compliance. The paper never reconciles how views can be too divergent for convergence yet sufficiently mutually intelligible for complex moral trade.

10. "The Scenario Analysis Privileges Particular Probability Weightings" — Section 5 argues readers should focus on scenario (3)—broad convergence—rather than scenario (1)—no convergence—because actions have higher impact in (3). But this conclusion depends on specific probability assignments and impact estimates that receive no defense. The claim that one can "increase the chance of Surviving by more than one part in a hundred thousand" in scenario (3) is asserted without argument. The paper's practical recommendations thus rest on probability estimates and counterfactual impact claims that are presented as if self-evident rather than as contestable empirical judgments requiring justification.
