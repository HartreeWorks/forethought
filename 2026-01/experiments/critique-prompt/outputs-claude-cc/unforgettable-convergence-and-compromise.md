1. "The Convergence Bootstrapping Problem": The paper argues that partial AM-convergence plus trade can achieve a mostly-great future because those who hold correct moral views can bargain for resources. But this inference assumes that the "correct" moral view is identifiable as a stable bargaining partner before the bargaining process determines outcomes. If antirealism is true (which the paper treats as a live possibility), then what counts as the "correct" view is itself potentially determined by or sensitive to the bargaining outcomes—whoever ends up with resources may thereby have stronger claims to correctness on subjectivist frameworks. The paper cannot simultaneously hold that correctness is subjective and that we can meaningfully assess whether trade leads to "mostly-great" outcomes independent of who wins the trade. If this objection holds, the entire trade-and-compromise framework collapses into a circular justification where success validates the moral views of the successful.

2. "The Alien Experience Escape Hatch": The paper argues that even meta-ethical hedonism combined with welfarism won't guarantee a mostly-great future because "the very best experiences are so alien that most people initially pursuing their self-interest cannot themselves experience them." But this same argument undermines the paper's earlier pessimism about convergence. If the best experiences are incomprehensible to current humans, then the paper's claims about how "narrow" the target of a mostly-great future is become unfounded—we literally cannot assess the width of a target we cannot conceptualize. The paper uses alien-experience arguments opportunistically: to defeat optimistic scenarios while preserving its pessimistic framing. Either we can reason about the space of possible valuable futures (in which case alien experiences don't defeat convergence arguments) or we cannot (in which case the "narrow target" thesis is itself unjustified).

3. "The Memetic Selection Reversal": The paper worries that "ideas might be so memetically potent that merely considering the idea makes an individual highly likely to adopt it" as a blocker to good outcomes. But if memetic fitness can diverge from truth, the same logic applies to the paper's own pessimistic conclusions about convergence. Perhaps the reason readers find "no easy eutopia" compelling is precisely because pessimism about coordination is memetically fit in academic contexts—it signals sophistication, avoids naive optimism, and creates demand for more research. The paper provides no way to distinguish its own arguments from memetically successful but false ideas, yet treats memetic hazards as asymmetrically threatening to optimistic views. If this objection holds, the paper needs a meta-level account of why its own reasoning escapes the memetic selection pressures it identifies.

4. "The Threat Asymmetry Assumption": The paper argues that value-destroying threats could rob trade scenarios of most value because "bads weigh more heavily than goods" and threats are cheap. But this assumes threat-makers and threat-receivers have asymmetric capacities—that it's easier to credibly threaten destruction than to credibly threaten retaliation or to build defensive capabilities. In a world of superintelligent advisors and "iron-clad contracts," the same technologies that enable credible threats also enable credible deterrence and mutual vulnerability. The paper's pessimism about threats depends on a technological asymmetry it never establishes and that seems implausible given the symmetric access to superintelligence it elsewhere assumes. If defensive and retaliatory capacities scale with offensive ones, the threat problem may be self-limiting rather than value-destroying.

5. "The Random Walk Misdirection": The paper's diagram showing moral reflection as a "random walk" that causes views to diverge assumes that reflection is directionless—that steps away from a shared starting point are equally likely in all directions. But the paper also claims (in section 2.3.1) that superintelligent reflection could introduce "arguments and considerations that human beings might never have thought of." If such arguments exist and have any rational force, reflection isn't random—it's biased toward wherever those arguments point. The random walk model is incompatible with the existence of genuinely better moral arguments. The paper deploys whichever model suits its local argumentative purpose: random walks when arguing against convergence, and the possibility of better arguments when discussing superintelligent advice. It cannot coherently maintain both.

6. "The Flourishing Denominator Problem": The paper's key claim that we're "far from the ceiling on Flourishing" depends on defining that ceiling. But if the correct moral view is (as the paper suggests possible) unbounded above and linear in resources, there is no ceiling—Flourishing approaches infinity as resources approach infinity. In that case, saying we're at "5-10%" of potential Flourishing is meaningless; any finite value is 0% of infinity. The paper's quantitative framing presupposes bounded value while its philosophical analysis treats unbounded value as a live possibility. If unbounded views are correct, the entire framework of "percentage of potential value captured" becomes incoherent, and with it the paper's central thesis about the scale of the problem.

7. "The Motivation-Belief Divorce That Proves Too Much": The paper argues that even if moral realism is true and people learn correct moral facts, they might not be motivated to act on them (externalism) or might avoid learning them (internalism). But this same divorce between moral knowledge and motivation would equally undermine the paper's own practical recommendations. If people systematically fail to be motivated by moral truths, why would the paper's readers—upon learning that working on "better futures" is important—actually do anything about it? The paper cannot simultaneously use motivation failures to generate pessimism about convergence while implicitly assuming its readers will be motivated by its conclusions. Either moral knowledge tends to motivate (which helps convergence) or it doesn't (which makes the paper practically inert).

8. "The Common-Sense Utopia Contradiction": The paper's previous essay apparently argued that "common-sense utopia achieves most possible value" on common-sense views, and this essay uses that as an example of potential gains from trade with total utilitarians. But if common-sense morality is correct and common-sense utopia achieves most value, then the "narrow target" thesis is false for most people—they're already aimed roughly correctly. The paper wants common-sense to be simultaneously (a) close enough to correct that common-sense utopia is highly valuable, justifying trade scenarios, but (b) far enough from correct that convergence is unlikely and the target is narrow. These requirements pull in opposite directions. Either common-sense is a good guide (making convergence more likely) or it isn't (making the trade scenarios less valuable).

9. "The Selection Effect Timing Dodge": The paper acknowledges that "non-discounting values might win out over time" through asymmetric growth but dismisses this because "the major decisions are made soon." This timing claim does enormous load-bearing work but receives no defense. Why should we expect major decisions to be made before selection effects operate? The paper elsewhere emphasizes uncertainty about how post-AGI society will be structured and governed. If we're uncertain about institutional forms, we should be equally uncertain about decision timing. The paper's pessimism here depends on a confident empirical prediction about the speed of lock-in relative to the speed of value selection—a prediction that seems no more justified than its negation.

10. "The Subjectivist Self-Defeat": The paper argues that subjectivists shouldn't expect convergence because different idealizing processes would lead to different conclusions, and there's no objective fact about which process is correct. But subjectivism, consistently applied, also implies there's no objective fact about whether "mostly-great futures" are actually better than alternatives. On subjectivism, the paper's entire concern about reaching mostly-great futures is just an expression of the authors' preferences, with no more claim to attention than anyone else's preferences for different futures. The paper argues against convergence using subjectivist premises while its normative force depends entirely on readers sharing something like the authors' preferences—which subjectivism gives us no reason to expect. If subjectivism defeats convergence, it equally defeats caring about the paper's conclusions.
