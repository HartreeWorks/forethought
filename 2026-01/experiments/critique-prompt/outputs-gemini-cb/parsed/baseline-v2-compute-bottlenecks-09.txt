"Unjustified 'Strongest Link' Assumption" — The author argues that AI R&D might be a "strongest link" problem (where one success suffices) rather than a "weakest link" problem (where all inputs must be present). This contradicts the standard engineering reality that successful deployment of new architectures usually requires a chain of successful steps: theoretical insight *plus* coding *plus* successful small tests *plus* successful large-scale validation. If any link in this chain (specifically large-scale validation) remains compute-dependent, the entire process is bottlenecked, revalidating the CES "weakest link" framing the author attempts to dismiss.
