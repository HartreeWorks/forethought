**Load-bearing claim:** AI researchers getting "smarter" (quality of labor) provides a boost that standard economic models (quantity of labor) miss.
**Attack type:** Equilibrium shift
**The specific problem:** The paper assumes intelligence maps linearly to solving R&D problems, but R&D difficulties often scale exponentially (e.g., finding the next optimization trick becomes distinctively harder as low-hanging fruit is plucked). As AI gets smarter, the difficulty of the remaining "compute-saving" inventions likely rises to meet them (the "Burden of Knowledge" effect).
**Impact:** The "smarter worker" bonus is canceled out by the increasing complexity of finding the next efficiency gain, neutralizing the proposed acceleration factor.
