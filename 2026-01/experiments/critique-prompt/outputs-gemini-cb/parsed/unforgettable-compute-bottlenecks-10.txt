**"The Feedback Latency Trap"**
The paper’s model assumes a tight feedback loop where AI improves AI. But in high-stakes R&D, the latency isn't just "run time"—it's "safety and stability time." An AI that modifies its own code introduces the risk of subtle, delayed failures (e.g., reward hacking or instability that only shows up after 1M steps). To prevent the intelligence explosion from becoming a "stupidity explosion" or a "crash explosion," rigorous, time-bound testing is required for every self-modification. If safety checks cannot be fully automated (because they require out-of-distribution generalization checks), the R&D loop is throttled by the speed of verification, rendering the surplus of compute-free "coding speed" irrelevant.
