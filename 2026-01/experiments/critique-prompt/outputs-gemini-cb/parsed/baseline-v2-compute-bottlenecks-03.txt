"The Validity of Small-Scale Proxies" — A central counterargument in the paper is that AI researchers could rely on "smaller scale experiments" to bypass compute limitations. This assumes that the behavior of massive frontier models can be reliably extrapolated from small, low-compute experiments. However, the "scaling laws" literature and recent empirical history suggest that many capabilities are emergent and only appear at specific scales, making small-scale proxies noisy or invalid predictors of frontier performance. If valid validation requires near-frontier compute, the substitutability of labor for compute is low, and the bottleneck remains severe.
