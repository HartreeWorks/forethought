**"The Synthetic Data Tax"**
The paper models the inputs to R&D as Labor and Compute, assuming that if you have smart labor, you can improve the algorithm. It ignores the third critical input: Data. As models exhaust human data, they require synthetic data to improve. Generating high-quality synthetic data is not a labor task; it is an inference task that costs compute. If the mechanism for "better algorithms" relies on "better curriculums" or "synthetic textbooks," the SIE feedback loop essentially becomes "using compute to generate data to train models," which re-introduces the compute bottleneck through the back door. You cannot substitute intelligence for the compute required to *instantiate* the data that intelligence learns from.
