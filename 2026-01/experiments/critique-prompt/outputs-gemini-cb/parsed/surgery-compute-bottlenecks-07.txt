**Load-bearing claim:** AI R&D is a "strongest link" problem where multiple routes exist, so we can select the one with the most favorable $\rho$.
**Attack type:** Countermodel (Pipeline dependencies)
**The specific problem:** Modern ML pipelines are "weakest link" systems: you need Data AND Architecture AND Verification. If Verification (running the model to see if it works) is compute-bottlenecked, having a superintelligence generate 1 billion brilliant architecture ideas is useless because you cannot filter them.
**Impact:** The bottleneck isn't idea generation; it is truth-seeking. If truth-seeking requires compute, the system is bottlenecked by the scarcest input, invalidating the "strongest link" optimization strategy.
