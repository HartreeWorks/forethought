**"The Utilization Ceiling"**
The paper treats "software progress" as an unbound multiplier, but much of what we call algorithmic efficiency (e.g., FlashAttention, quantization) is actually just better hardware utilization. If current methods already utilize 50-60% of theoretical FLOPs/memory bandwidth, there is a hard physical limit to how much "optimization" can deliver—likely less than 1 order of magnitude (OOM), not the 5+ OOMs required for an SIE. Once the software perfectly saturates the hardware, software progress decouples from hardware utilization and must rely purely on sample efficiency, which is mathematically harder to squeeze and may have information-theoretic limits.
