**"Amdahl’s Law of R&D"**
The paper posits that we can pour "an unlimited supply" of AI researchers into the problem to accelerate progress. This assumes R&D is highly parallelizable. However, scientific discovery often follows a serial dependency graph: Discovery B cannot be made until Discovery A has been trained, tested, and analyzed. Even with 1 billion AI researchers, if the "unit time" of a training run is 3 months, and you need 4 sequential breakthroughs to reach superintelligence, you cannot compress that timeline below 1 year. If the serial portion of the task is even moderate, the speedup from adding parallel agents asymptotes quickly (Amdahl’s Law), regardless of compute availability.
