**Load-bearing claim:** Compute bottlenecks are unlikely to block an SIE in its *early* stages (0 vs -0.2 difference is small at low OOMs).
**Attack type:** Parameter sensitivity (Initial Conditions)
**The specific problem:** This holds only if we start at a point where Labor and Capital are balanced ($L \approx K$). However, the current AI industry is heavily compute-constrained (massive demand for H100s, huge training runs), suggesting we are already operating in a regime where the marginal return on Labor is diminishing relative to Capital.
**Impact:** We may start the SIE already on the "flat" part of the CES curve. In this regime, $\rho$ bites immediately, preventing the momentum required to initiate the explosion loop.
