"Omission of Data as a Binding Constraint" — The CES model utilized ($Y = f(K, L)$) reduces AI progress to a function of compute and labor, neglecting Data as a third, potentially non-substitutable input. If the "next token" of progress requires novel data from the physical world (which cannot be simulated without infinite compute), then neither adding more researchers ($L$) nor optimizing code ($K$-efficiency) will accelerate progress beyond the rate of real-world data acquisition. By excluding data from the production function, the paper ignores a potential bottleneck that is entirely independent of the software-compute dynamic.
