"The Conflation of Labor Quantity and Quality" — The paper argues that economic estimates of $\rho$ fail to account for workers becoming "smarter" or "faster," rather than just more numerous. However, in formal economic modeling, $L$ (Labor) typically represents "effective labor units," not merely a headcount. If one AGI researcher is 100 times smarter or faster than a human, this is mathematically equivalent to increasing the quantity of $L$ by 100, which does not escape the diminishing returns inherent in a CES function with $\rho < 0$. By treating "smarts" as a qualitative factor outside the model rather than a quantitative increase in effective labor, the author artificially inflates the potential for escaping the bottleneck.
