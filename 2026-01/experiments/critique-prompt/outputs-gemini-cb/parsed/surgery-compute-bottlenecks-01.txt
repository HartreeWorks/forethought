**Load-bearing claim:** In the limit of infinite cognitive labor, AI researchers could simulate computational experiments in their heads, implying $\rho$ is not effectively negative.
**Attack type:** Countermodel (Thermodynamic/Computational)
**The specific problem:** The paper treats "cognitive labor" as an abstract input separate from "compute," but AI researchers *are* software running on hardware. To "simulate a neural network in one's head" requires running a simulation that is necessarily less efficient than running the code directly on optimized hardware (due to emulation overhead). If the premise is "fixed compute," adding "infinite AI researchers" is physically impossible because those researchers require the very compute resources they are supposed to substitute for.
**Impact:** The theoretical limit of substitutability is not 0; it is strictly bounded by the inference cost of the researchers. The feedback loop cannibalizes its own substrate immediately, halting the explosion earlier than predicted.
