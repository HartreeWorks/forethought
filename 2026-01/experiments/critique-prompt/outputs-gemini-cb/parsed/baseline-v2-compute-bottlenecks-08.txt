"Ambiguity in the Definition of Progress" — The paper uses "pace of AI software progress" as the output variable ($Y$), but alternates between interpreting this as "efficiency" (doing the same task with less compute) and "capability" (doing new, harder tasks). These are not interchangeable; it is possible to massively optimize the efficiency of a system without achieving the capability jumps required for a Singularity-style explosion. If the metric for SIE is *superintelligence* (capability), but the primary output of compute-constrained research is merely *efficiency*, the argument fails to demonstrate that superintelligence is achievable without scaling hardware.
