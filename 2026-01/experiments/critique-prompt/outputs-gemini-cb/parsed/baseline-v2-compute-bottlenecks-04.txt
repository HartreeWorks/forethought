"Misapplication of Long-Run Economic Parameters" — The author cites Jones (2003) to suggest that in the long run, $\rho$ approaches 0 (Cobb-Douglas), implying high substitutability. However, Jones’s hypothesis relies on the ability to eventually accumulate or reconfigure physical capital ($K$) to match new technologies. The definition of a "Software Intelligence Explosion," as given in the paper, explicitly constrains the scenario to *fixed* hardware. It is logically inconsistent to use long-run economic parameters—which assume capital mobility and accumulation—to model a short-run scenario defined strictly by a hard cap on physical capital.
