"Underestimation of Verification Latency" — The paper assumes that "fast-thinking" AGIs can accelerate the R&D loop indefinitely. However, while the *generation* of ideas can be accelerated by software speed, the *verification* of those ideas (training a model to see if it works) has a fixed latency determined by the hardware clock speed and sequential dependencies of gradient descent. Even if an AGI generates a million ideas per second, if it takes two weeks to empirically verify which one works (due to fixed compute speeds), the R&D cycle time is dominated by the verification latency, rendering the increased thinking speed marginally useful.
