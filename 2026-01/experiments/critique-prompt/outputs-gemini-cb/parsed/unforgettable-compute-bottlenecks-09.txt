**"The Entropy of Design Space"**
The paper relies on the "Economist Version" where inputs are smooth curves. In reality, the space of valid algorithms is a rugged landscape with high entropy. As models become more complex, the search space for improvements grows exponentially, not linearly. The paper assumes that smarter agents are linear "accelerators" of finding these improvements. However, if the difficulty of finding the next algorithmic breakthrough scales exponentially (as the low-hanging fruit vanishes), and intelligence only scales the search capabilities linearly or polynomially, the rate of progress will stagnate even if $\rho$ is favorable. The bottleneck isn't the hardware; it's the sheer combinatorial explosion of the search space.
