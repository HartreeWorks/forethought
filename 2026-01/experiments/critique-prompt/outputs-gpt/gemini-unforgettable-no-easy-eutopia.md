1. "Your conclusion is an artifact of defining ‘best’ as a percentile, not a property of the world." The entire framework defines a “best feasible future” as a 99.99th percentile outcome under a “well-informed” distribution, then measures everything as fractions of that benchmark. That makes “eutopia is hard” nearly automatic whenever the tail is heavy or the outcome space is huge—because percentiles in fat-tailed spaces are, by construction, separated by absurd ratios. The paper then treats this separation as a discovery about reality rather than a consequence of its measuring stick. This isn’t fixable by tweaking parameters: any defense that “we chose 99.99% for robustness” just restates the problem, because the fragility comes from percentile-normalization itself in high-variance spaces.

2. "Perverse instantiation: the paper’s ‘mostly-great’ world can be made rare by adding gratuitous dimensions." The “value as product of N factors” model is presented as capturing eutopian fragility, but it also gives a recipe for manufacturing fragility out of thin air: take any future you’d call “mostly great,” then refine your moral theory into more “relatively independent factors” (split autonomy into ten sub-factors, friendship into twenty, etc.). By the paper’s own toy model, increasing N mechanically drives almost all probability mass toward near-zero value, making “mostly-great futures rare” regardless of what the world is like. That means the central argumentative engine is not evidence-sensitive; it’s representation-sensitive. If the author defends by insisting there is a “true” factorization, they’ve smuggled in the hidden crux (a privileged decomposition of value) that their earlier moral-pluralism rhetoric explicitly denies.

3. "Load-bearing metaphor: ‘eutopia is a narrow target’ quietly assumes a Euclidean geometry of moral space that no one has justified." The island/target analogy does the crucial work: narrow target ⇒ low probability of hitting it by default. But nothing in moral or social reality licenses the move from “many ways to be wrong” to “small measure of right outcomes,” because “measure” depends on topology and dynamics, not just cardinality of failure modes. In many real optimization systems, attractors are large: diverse initial conditions funnel into a few stable basins (e.g., convergent institutions, coordination equilibria), which makes “narrow” endpoints common, not rare. The paper never models basins of attraction; it asserts geometric narrowness as if moral space were uniformly sampled noise. Any attempted defense (“but there are many independent issues”) just repeats the metaphor instead of providing the missing structure that turns “issues exist” into “default probability is tiny.”

4. "Self-undermining move: you claim ‘no safe option’ across moral views, then build a thesis that depends on aggregating across moral views." In Section 2.3 you emphasize that almost any grand future will look catastrophically flawed from some reasonable moral perspective, implying deep pluralism and persistent disagreement. But Sections 3 and 3.5 then rely on representing “plausible moral views” in a common expected-utility framework and comparing fussiness across them in a way that is meant to guide real prioritization. If the pluralism bite is real, the paper’s own “eutopia is hard” claim becomes viewpoint-relative in a way that blocks the intended policy implication (“we should be pessimistic about default flourishing”). If the author defends by doubling down on the VNM representation as the “right” meta-ethics, they abandon the earlier rhetorical appeal to broad moral diversity; if they loosen VNM, the quantitative fussiness machinery collapses.

5. "Reversal result: your historical evidence supports ‘eutopia is easy’ via moral convergence and error-correction." The paper cites a long history of societies being “in the midst of moral catastrophe” and not noticing, and uses this to infer that future societies will also miss huge moral errors by default. But the same record is at least as consistent with the opposite: many once-normal atrocities (slavery, disenfranchisement, brutal punishment) became widely recognized as wrong through endogenous processes—economic change, information flow, institutional reform, expanding moral circle—without any coordinated de dicto optimization for “the best outcomes.” That is exactly the kind of default drift toward better states the paper is trying to deny. If the author responds that progress is contingent and incomplete, that concedes the data do not discriminate; their evidence stops supporting “no easy eutopia” and becomes compatible with “often messy, but strong attractors toward improvements.”

6. "Vacuous truth: ‘mostly-great is unlikely without aiming at it’ is made true by defining the distribution as ‘no serious coordinated effort’ and then packing all goodness into ‘serious coordinated effort’." The key probability question is always conditioned on “no more serious optimisation pressure than today” from agents pursuing the best outcomes de dicto. That conditioning clause quietly removes from the reference class precisely the mechanisms most likely to produce high-value futures (institutional learning, selection for better governance, AI-mediated moral deliberation, competitive pressure to adopt welfare-enhancing norms). You then conclude mostly-great futures are unlikely “by default,” but “default” has been defined to exclude many default-like dynamics that have historically operated. If the author defends by saying “those dynamics count as optimisation pressure,” then the thesis becomes trivial: if you define “default” as “without the forces that improve outcomes,” then of course good outcomes are unlikely.

7. "Hidden crux: the paper assumes a single, well-defined ‘true’ ranking of futures even while using moral disagreement as the main source of fragility." The argument needs moral error to be both (a) ubiquitous (many plausible views condemn futures) and (b) objectively catastrophic (there is a fact of the matter about which view is right, making the others ‘errors’ that destroy value). But the paper’s own examples rely on disagreements that look structurally underdetermined (population ethics, digital personhood, discounting, ‘objective goods’ vs hedonism) where the live possibility is not “we’ll get it wrong,” but “there may be no uniquely correct answer that makes talk of ‘missing most value’ coherent.” If the author defends by asserting robust moral realism, they must justify why that realism singles out one narrow set of answers rather than supporting broad permissiveness; if they retreat to anti-realism or constructivism, “lost potential value” becomes a projection, and the “no easy eutopia” thesis loses its bite.

8. "Your fat-tail move double-counts ignorance: you treat uncertainty about the tail as evidence the tail dominates." In Section 3.2 you argue: even if we’re merely uncertain whether value-efficiency is fat-tailed, the expected distribution is fat-tailed, so the conclusion is robust. That is a classic mistake: mixing distributions can create heavy tails in the predictive distribution without implying that the underlying world contains extreme realizable efficiencies accessible to agents (it can be pure epistemic variance). You then convert epistemic humility into substantive moral demandingness: because we don’t know, we should act as if the best uses are astronomically better and almost everything else wastes “most value.” If the author defends by saying “decision-making should respect heavy-tailed expectations,” they inherit the standard paradoxes of Pascalian fanatical reasoning—which the paper elsewhere treats as a reductio against linear/unbounded views—so the argument eats itself.

9. "The bounded/unbounded taxonomy is a false fork: the paper rigs ‘plausible’ to mean ‘fussy’ by construction." The essay systematically prunes the space of theories: superlinear is dismissed, sublinear unbounded is dismissed, bounded-universal becomes “approximately linear anyway,” bounded-difference-making is called problematic, and the one family that looks easygoing (joint aggregation, low bound) is then tarred as narrow/implausible and possibly pro-extinction. What’s left is a curated museum in which every corridor leads to “fussy,” not because reality points there, but because alternatives are rejected whenever they would produce easygoingness. This is not a matter of adding citations; it’s a structural selection effect: “plausibility” is effectively operationalized as “yields the conclusion.” If the author defends by reinstating excluded families, they re-open the possibility that easy eutopia is common; if they don’t, the argument is just definitional gatekeeping.

10. "The paper’s ‘moral catastrophe’ concept collapses into ‘anything suboptimal,’ making ‘most value lost’ meaningless at scale." You repeatedly treat outcomes as catastrophically value-destroying because they fail to maximize on some dimension (insufficient scale, wrong rights, wrong welfare theory, wrong resource allocation), even when everyone is happy, free, and endorses their lives. Under your own normalization, “catastrophe” can mean “only 1/20 billionth of best” due purely to not expanding, or “negative” due to tiny bads in vast space, which makes ordinary moral language do misleading work. The result is that “no easy eutopia” becomes compatible with futures that are, by any non-pathological standard, spectacular successes—so the thesis stops discriminating between genuinely grim prospects and merely-non-maximal ones. If the author defends by insisting the scale really matters, they commit to the very fanatical implications they earlier flag as bizarre; if they soften it, the headline claim (“great futures are hard”) deflates into “the absolute optimum is hard,” which no one denied.
