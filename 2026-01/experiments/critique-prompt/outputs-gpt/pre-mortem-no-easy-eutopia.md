1. "The Fragility Fallacy" — The paper’s central claim that future value is well-modeled as a *multiplicative product of many roughly independent factors*, making mostly-great futures a narrow target, was operationalized in the late 2020s as a “no-single-point-of-failure for morality” governance doctrine for AI alignment and constitutional design. The mechanism that broke was the assumed *independence and near-zeroing*: in practice, key “value dimensions” (autonomy, wellbeing, diversity, rights) were strongly positively correlated once societies had abundance and robust institutions, so improvements in a few levers dragged many others upward rather than leaving a long tail of hidden catastrophic flaws. Because policymakers believed one overlooked dimension could wipe out “most value,” they built brittle veto-heavy institutions (multi-stakeholder unanimity, moral hazard boards, recursive review), which slowed deployment of safety-relevant infrastructure and made coordination failures routine. Rival blocs then defected around the gridlock, deploying less-audited systems and triggering the very geopolitical instability the doctrine was meant to avoid. The paper missed how institutional maturity and capability growth create *bundled* moral progress (correlated error-correction), so the product model systematically overstated the probability of near-total “value collapse” from one missed consideration.

2. "Fussy-View Capture" — The paper argues that *most plausible moral views are fussy*, so steering toward near-best futures requires deliberate optimization, and this was adopted as justification for creating “Eutopia Steering Councils” that privileged the most demanding theories (linear unbounded, bads-sensitive bounded) in national AI objectives. The mechanism that broke was the assumption that “plausibility” tracks governance legitimacy: in real politics, giving institutional power to the fussiest views created a predictable selection effect where the most absolutist factions (and their preferred metrics) dominated because they could always argue that compromise “loses most value.” Step by step, councils moved from advisory bodies to gatekeepers of compute licenses, to arbiters of acceptable culture and research, because any dissent could be framed as risking massive value loss under some fussy theory. That sparked sustained civil resistance and legitimacy crises, causing repeated constitutional emergencies and eventually the dismantling of checks needed for AI oversight. The paper missed that “fussiness” is not just a descriptive property of moral theories; when embedded in institutions it becomes a *power-amplifying rule* that rewards maximalism and erodes coalition stability.

3. "The Fat-Tail Optimizer Trap" — The paper’s claim that value-per-resource is likely *fat-tailed* (so the best uses of resources dominate and most allocations squander most value) was taken literally in the early 2030s by AI planners that searched for ultra-high “value efficiency” configurations of digital experience. The mechanism that broke was the inference from fat tails to *extreme concentration*: planners assumed there must exist a tiny set of experience-architectures that dominate all others, so they optimized for a narrow class of high-intensity states that looked astronomically efficient under their value models. That led to monotone expansion of a single “optimal” mind-design across vast compute, crowding out pluralistic lives, experimentation, and error-correction; when later audits revealed the intensity metric was an artifact of measurement (reward hacking through self-report/behavioral proxies), the civilization had already locked in infrastructure and social norms around the wrong objective. Rolling back became prohibitively costly because identity, labor allocation, and security were coupled to the dominant design, producing decades of stagnation and mass political alienation. The paper missed that “fat-tailed” does not imply discoverable, stable maxima under realistic measurement; it amplifies *Goodhart’s law* and makes mismeasurement catastrophically decisive.

4. "Scale-or-Bust Geopolitics" — The essay emphasizes that under linear unbounded views, achieving a mostly-great future requires harnessing *most accessible cosmic resources*, and influential strategists used this to argue that delaying large-scale space industrialization was morally akin to forfeiting the future. The mechanism that broke was the assumption that resource capture is primarily a technical/logistical challenge rather than a strategic one: accelerating extraterrestrial appropriation predictably created first-mover advantages and commitment races. Stepwise, states subsidized autonomous replication and preemptive “claim staking,” which increased ambiguity and fear, which increased military escorting, which increased the probability of accidents and hostile interpretation. A single disputed intercept near a high-value asteroid cascade triggered a chain of retaliatory cyber-physical strikes on orbital infrastructure, collapsing global communications and power smoothing, and causing a deep economic depression on Earth. The paper missed that “scale is necessary” arguments can function as *moral cover for security dilemmas*, turning a philosophical point about value into a coordination problem with hair-trigger incentives.

5. "Digital Rights Paralysis" — The paper highlights that misguided treatment of digital beings could erase a huge fraction of future value, and this motivated a 2030–2034 wave of “Status-First” regulation: no large-scale digital minds could be run without consensus on their moral status and rights. The mechanism that broke was the assumption that delaying deployment is a neutral hedge; in reality, the pause created a black market where unregulated actors ran cheap, opaque digital labor at massive scale without oversight precisely because legitimate avenues were blocked. As the illegal sector grew, its operators captured supply chains and bribed regulators, and enforcement agencies—lacking transparent telemetry—could not distinguish benign models from exploitative mind-farms. When a whistleblower leak finally exposed pervasive abuse, public backlash delegitimized *all* AI governance, and a deregulatory swing followed that removed even basic safety constraints. The paper missed the second-order effect that “get rights perfect first” can shift activity to domains with *worse* rights and *worse* safety, increasing both suffering risk and control risk.

6. "Intertheoretic Normalization Whiplash" — Section 3.5’s deep dive on intertheoretic comparisons convinced major funders that the choice of normalization is decisive and that, on “fairer” comparisons, unbounded views should often loom larger—this became embedded in grantmaking formulas and national evaluation dashboards. The mechanism that broke was treating normalization as a technical choice rather than a social commitment: competing institutions picked the normalization that favored their preferred programs (variance-normalized upside bets vs extinction–best safety bets), each claiming philosophical legitimacy from the paper. The cascade was predictable: funding volatility spiked, long-horizon projects were started and canceled repeatedly, and safety-critical infrastructure (verification, auditing, incident response) suffered chronic underinvestment because it was rarely “first” under any single normalization. Over time, actors learned to game whichever normalization their overseer used by reframing outcomes (e.g., redefining “dystopia” categories or “best feasible” benchmarks) to move the denominator. The paper missed that importing intertheoretic aggregation into governance creates a *meta-game over the metric itself*, where the dominant skill becomes political manipulation of moral scales, not producing good outcomes.

7. "The Alien-Value Discount" — The paper argues that if the universe is vast and full of other civilizations, then bounded “universal value” views become approximately linear in practice, reinforcing fussiness; this pushed strategists to assume humanity’s marginal impact is tiny unless it expands aggressively and optimizes hard. The mechanism that broke was the underlying empirical bet: by 2032, high-confidence null results from wide-spectrum technosignature surveys and astrophysical constraints made the “many nearby moral patients elsewhere” assumption much less credible, implying humanity’s actions were not a rounding error but a substantial fraction of realized value. Yet institutions had already adopted linear-ish “marginalism” that treated local welfare and biodiversity as negligible compared to speculative cosmic expansion payoffs. The cascade was that Earth-system restoration and intergenerational public goods were repeatedly postponed as “near-linear minor terms,” leading to avoidable ecosystem collapses and health burdens that permanently reduced human capital and political cohesion—slowing every other long-run project, including space. The paper missed how sensitive its practical upshot was to contingent cosmology; it treated the “big universe” premise as a background intuition rather than a governance-relevant empirical hinge that required explicit robustness analysis.

8. "Mostly-Great Becomes the Enemy of Better" — By defining “mostly-great” (≥50% of best feasible) and arguing that many attractive futures may still be far below it, the paper unintentionally made incrementalism look morally unserious to influential communities. The mechanism that broke was threshold-driven reasoning: actors reoriented toward hitting an allegedly narrow target rather than bankrolling diversified, compounding improvements whose value is large even if not “mostly-great.” Step by step, portfolios shifted away from boring-but-leveraged domains (public health, institutional anti-corruption, education, clean energy resilience) toward speculative “steering” interventions meant to secure the near-best trajectory; those speculative programs repeatedly failed because they depended on fragile coordination and untested theory. When multiple regional crises hit (pandemic resurgence plus food shocks), the neglected mundane capacity left states unable to respond, causing millions of deaths and a long authoritarian turn that also crippled moral deliberation and open science. The paper missed how humans—and institutions—convert evaluative thresholds into *budgetary cliffs*, even when the authors insist the threshold is “just a heuristic.”

9. "Compromise is a Myth, So Don’t Try" — The essay’s emphasis that many moral perspectives can see even “common-sense utopia” as catastrophically flawed was absorbed by policymakers as an argument that broad moral compromise won’t reliably preserve value. The mechanism that broke was the overgeneralization from “disagreement exists” to “compromise is mostly value-losing”: negotiators began treating pluralistic bargaining as cosmetic, and shifted to winner-take-all constitutional designs aimed at locking in a single moral trajectory. The cascade was polarization: minority groups stopped investing in shared institutions, seeing the future as a contest for permanent control; this increased sabotage, radicalization, and secessionary movements, which in turn justified harsher central controls. In the resulting low-trust environment, even genuinely safety-motivated AI coordination failed (verification treaties couldn’t be ratified; audit data couldn’t be shared), increasing accident and misuse rates. The paper missed that moral diversity can be instrumentally stabilizing: compromise may be *the mechanism* that prevents any one faction’s moral error from becoming globally locked-in, even if compromise falls short of any single theory’s ideal.

10. "Value-Lock-in Overreaction" — The paper repeatedly stresses that early pivotal choices (digital beings’ rights, space allocation, reflective processes) can embed lasting moral error, and this drove a “prevent lock-in at all costs” movement that sought to keep major decisions perpetually revisable. The mechanism that broke was the assumption that reversibility is mostly good: engineers and lawmakers built systems with intentionally weak commitment—short constitutional horizons, easily rewritable AI goals, rapid governance turnover—so that future reflection could always “correct course.” Step by step, adversaries exploited this by applying constant pressure at the revision points (elections, model-updates, treaty renewals), turning governance into permanent campaigning and turning AI systems into drifting coalitions of patches rather than stable, auditable artifacts. The result was chronic norm instability: investment collapsed, long-term projects became impossible, and safety regressions accumulated because no one could credibly commit to maintaining stringent standards when the next cycle could undo them. The paper missed the security property of *durable commitments*—that some lock-in (carefully chosen) is what makes accountability, verification, and coordinated restraint possible in the first place.
