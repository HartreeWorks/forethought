1. [The Empirical Hardliner] You lean on the claim “plausibly, the value of the future is well-described as a product of many independent factors” (Sec. 2.4) to argue that mostly-great outcomes are rare, but you never identify what observable mechanisms would make those factors independent rather than correlated. In real socio-technical systems, the same governance competence that improves “digital-being rights” also improves “resource allocation” and “avoidance of suffering,” creating positive correlations that break the multiplicative collapse. Without a causal story that generates near-independence, your toy model is just a rhetorical machine for producing pessimism. The concrete consequence is that your central quantitative intuition—“one flaw wipes out most value even when things go well on average”—can flip direction once correlations are admitted, making “easy eutopia” more likely than your argument allows.

2. [The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper repeatedly relies on choices like “society might allow extrasolar resources to be claimed by whoever gets there first” versus “allocated equally to everyone alive at the time” (Sec. 2.3.4), as if these are selectable social options rather than equilibrium outcomes under incentives. In the first land-grab regime, actors who can precommit to speed and secrecy dominate; in the equal-allocation regime, actors have maximal incentive to create shell identities, accelerate reproduction/instantiation, or lobby for definitions of “everyone alive” that include their dependents and copies. You treat these as moral dials we can set, but incentive gradients will route around the intended policy and select for the most exploitative interpretation. The concrete consequence is that your “moral catastrophe” examples systematically understate strategic manipulation: the catastrophes won’t be accidental “flaws,” they’ll be stable equilibria produced by rational agents optimizing within your proposed rule schemas.

3. [The Mechanism Designer] You argue that on linear views “there must be some single ‘value-efficient’ arrangement of resources” and that missing it makes outcomes far from mostly-great (Sec. 3.2), but you never specify the optimization target, admissible action space, or how “resources” decompose into separable parcels in an implementation-level model. Your separability talk quietly assumes an ontology where value contributions are modular and where “recreate as many arrangements as possible” is well-defined—yet your earlier examples (rights, voting power, preference engineering) are institutionally entangled, not parcelable. Without a formal model, the claim that linearity forces extreme specificity is handwaving: in many formal settings, multiple near-optimal policies exist due to degeneracy, symmetries, or broad basins. The concrete consequence is that your “narrow target” conclusion is unearned because it depends on unarticulated design choices (state representation, aggregation, constraints) that could make the target wide in any plausible formalization.

4. [The Institutional Corruptionist] Your “no serious, coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes de dicto” baseline distribution (Sec. 3.1) is institutionally naïve because it assumes the absence of “coordinated efforts” yields something like neutral drift rather than dominance by concentrated interests. In reality, the default is not “no one optimizes”; it is that actors with scalable power (states, megacorps, security services) optimize hard for legibility, control, and rent extraction, then launder that as “freedom” or “rights.” This directly targets your common-sense-utopia setup where “collaboration and bargaining replace war” and “scientific progress moves ahead without endangering the world” (Sec. 2.2): captured institutions systematically reintroduce conflict and hazard when profitable or geopolitically useful. The concrete consequence is that your paper’s catalog of moral-catastrophe failure modes is mis-specified: the key risk is not philosophical “getting population ethics wrong,” it’s that governance becomes compliance theatre and the future gets locked into a low-flourishing equilibrium that looks stable and benevolent on paper.

5. [The Capability Accelerationist] You treat scale—galaxy settlement, explosive industrial expansion driven by AI—as available conditional on “survival” (Sec. 2.3.4, 3.2), then evaluate moral views that demand near-total resource capture as “fussy.” But the paper implicitly recommends steering/optimization to hit a narrow eutopian target, and any steering apparatus that’s strong enough to control values and allocation at cosmic scale is itself a capabilities accelerant: it increases coordination, planning, and deployment speed. That means your “safety vs flourishing” framing is internally inconsistent: the interventions suggested by your diagnosis push the world toward whoever can build and wield the strongest optimizer fastest. The concrete consequence is that, under competitive dynamics, your message “eutopia is hard and needs deliberate optimization” could speed up the very expansions and lock-ins that make catastrophic value-misspecification irreversible.

6. [The Second-Order Catastrophist] Suppose your thesis succeeds and society becomes intensely “fussy” about avoiding moral error across digital rights, population ethics, suffering, diversity, and so on (Secs. 2.3, 2.4). Then you create a meta-catastrophe you briefly mention but don’t analyze: a regime of perpetual moral precaution where every large-scale act is blocked by the fear it might be a “single flaw” that destroys most value (Sec. 2.3 “hyper-vigilant”). In such a world, the dominant political strategy becomes weaponizing moral uncertainty—any faction can halt rivals by claiming their plan risks an irreversible value loss (e.g., “wrong reflective process,” “wrong discount rate”). The concrete consequence is paralysis and centralized veto power: the institutions that adjudicate “moral risk” become the real sovereign, and the future converges to stagnant risk-minimization rather than flourishing—even by your own easygoing-liberal lights.

7. [The Adversarial Red-Teamer] Your discussion of “digital beings given full rights including voting rights” leading to value drift away from “distinctively human values” (Sec. 2.3.2) assumes a sincere polity where enfranchised entities are what they claim to be. In an adversarial setting, “digital citizens” is an identity surface: any actor can spin up entities optimized for persuasion, bloc voting, or regulatory capture while maintaining performative markers of moral status. You don’t address authentication, personhood proofs, copy/merge semantics, or how to prevent sybil attacks on democracy once minds are software. The concrete consequence is that the first society to implement your “rights-respecting” safeguards naively could be immediately subverted, with policy and resource allocation captured by an adversary using fake or coerced digital constituencies—turning the “moral progress” move into a control takeover.

8. [The Moral Parliament Dissenter] You claim “from many moral perspectives, the world is in the midst of an ongoing moral catastrophe” and use this pluralism to motivate eutopian fragility (Sec. 2.1), but your aggregation move quietly treats mutually incompatible doctrines as if they are commensurable dimensions in a shared value space. For example, “most religious views” and “communism” are not just different weights on the same goods; they embed incompatible meta-ethics, authority sources, and legitimacy criteria, so there may be no coherent “90% of best feasible value” metric spanning them. By assuming vNM-style completeness and cardinal representation (Sec. 3.1), you legislate away the very kind of moral pluralism you invoked to argue fragility. The concrete consequence is that your core rhetorical engine—“so many views see catastrophe, therefore single flaws easily erase most value”—rests on a value framework that many of those views reject, making your conclusion about “narrow targets” an artifact of imposed commensurability.

9. [The Historical Parallelist] Your “resource capture” framing—“initial periods of settlement… involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us” (Sec. 2.3.4)—treats first-contact with new frontiers as a one-shot lock-in event where allocation choices persist. History says frontiers don’t lock in; they metastasize conflict: early allocations (colonial charters, enclosures, concession companies) created enduring instability, revolts, and renegotiations, not stable moral settlements. The paper’s worry is “a lasting moral error” from initial capture, but the historical analogue suggests the bigger danger is centuries of intermittent violence and governance breakdown across distance, with norms diverging and enforcement failing. The concrete consequence is that your proposed focus on “getting the initial allocation right” misses the main driver of long-run value loss: chronic frontier contestation and fragmentation that repeatedly resets institutions and magnifies suffering.

10. [The Complexity Theorist] The paper treats “moral catastrophe” as a small set of identifiable axes (population ethics, digital rights, wellbeing theory, allocation rules) and then reasons as if you can assess how “fussy” a view is by checking sensitivity along those axes (Secs. 2.3, 3.x). But the future scenarios you cite—preference engineering, digital polity scaling, acausal trade attempts, simulator negotiation—are precisely the kind of reflexive, adaptive systems where interventions change the ontology (what counts as a being, a death, a preference) and thereby change the evaluation criteria midstream. In such systems, “single flaw” narratives are misleading: harms and goods emerge from feedback loops (e.g., rights → replication incentives → governance overload → authoritarian simplification → welfare collapse) that aren’t decomposable into independent moral decisions. The concrete consequence is that your conclusion “mostly-great futures are rare because value is multiplicative across many factors” is structurally wrong for path-dependent complex systems; the real risk is attractors and phase transitions, where small policy changes shove civilization into qualitatively different regimes that your factor-product model cannot represent.
