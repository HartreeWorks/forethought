"Misclassification and Overreach in the Taxonomy of Moral Views" — The paper’s “unbounded vs bounded” and “linear vs sublinear” taxonomy is presented as if it captures most plausible moral theories, and then it is used to argue that “most plausible moral views are fussy.” But many influential views do not fit neatly: prioritarianism, sufficientarianism, capabilities approaches, deontological constraints with lexical priorities, contractualism, and virtue ethics can resist the paper’s cardinal scaling, separability claims, and resource-based growth framing. Even within utilitarian families, “separability in resources” at large scales is controversial, and the argument that “only linear views are separable” is asserted rather than established (especially given spatial/temporal interactions, option value, and path dependence). The discussion also seems to treat “bounded = concave = approximately linear at small margins” as decisive, but that depends on how the bound is set and what variable the function is concave in (resources, persons, welfare, moral reasons, or something else). By narrowing the formal framework, the paper risks generating fussiness as a modeling artifact: if you force diverse moral concerns into a single VNM-expected-utility scalar over prospects, you may create apparent knife-edges that the original theories would deny. A more cautious conclusion would be that “within a certain formal family of aggregative, cardinalizable theories, fussiness is common,” not that “easygoingness is unlikely” across moral philosophy.
