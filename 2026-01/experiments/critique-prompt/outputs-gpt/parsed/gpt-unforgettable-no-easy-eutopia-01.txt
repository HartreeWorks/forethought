**"The Percentile Anchor Paradox"**: Your key inference is that “most achievable value lies in a narrow range of feasible outcomes” because “best feasible future” is defined as the 99.99th percentile of a distribution over futures. But that definition makes “fussiness” largely a byproduct of your percentile anchoring: you set the top of the scale to an extreme tail event, then unsurprisingly most outcomes land far below 50% or 90% of that extreme. Step-by-step: (i) pick a very high quantile as the reference point; (ii) normalize it to 1; (iii) call 0.5 “mostly-great”; (iv) conclude “mostly-great is rare” whenever the distribution is even mildly heavy-tailed—independent of any substantive moral fragility claims. This self-undermines the essay’s attempt to argue that “no easy eutopia” is a deep fact about the moral landscape rather than an artifact of how you chose the yardstick. If this objection holds, you must either (a) justify why 99.99% is the correct normatively meaningful anchor (not just “exceptionally well”), or (b) switch to a reference class that does not mechanically build rarity into “mostly-great” (e.g., anchoring to a realistic optimum under bounded rationality or to a non-tail benchmark like a high-but-not-extreme achievable standard).
