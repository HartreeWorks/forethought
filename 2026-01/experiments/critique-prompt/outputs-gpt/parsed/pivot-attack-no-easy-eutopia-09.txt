**“The 10^22 Thought Experiment Smuggles a Disvalue Geometry”** (attacks **Pivot P5: “on separate aggregation bounded views… if as little as one resource in 10^22 is used toward bads… we don’t reach a mostly-great future”**). The star-by-star reasoning presumes that “one part in 10^22 bad” aggregates into “a star system’s worth” of bad that sits at ~50% of the disvalue bound—i.e., it assumes a near-linear mapping from “fraction of cosmic resources used badly” to “where we are on the bounded disvalue curve.” But that mapping is exactly what’s in dispute: many separate-aggregation bounded functions would treat dispersed, low-intensity bads very differently from concentrated horrors, and would not equate “one star system’s worth of bad” with “half the disvalue bound” unless the disvalue function is tuned to make any nontrivial bads nearly saturating. If you instead model bads as (a) avoidable/local, (b) diminishing in marginal disvalue at scale, or (c) heavily sensitive to intensity rather than resource share, then the “almost no bads allowed” conclusion does not follow, and separate-aggregation bounded views can be substantially more easygoing than the essay claims. Since the essay uses this result to argue that even the “least implausible bounded views” are fussy, breaking it re-opens a large class of plausible easygoing theories. If this objection holds, the authors would need to specify a defensible disvalue functional form (and an intensity/resource mapping) that yields the 10^22 fragility across reasonable parameterizations, rather than relying on the illustrative cosmic-fraction arithmetic.
