> If the value dimensions are positively correlated through shared institutions rather than independent, "mostly-great" futures become common instead of multiplicatively rare, undermining the fragility argument.

**“The Independence Mirage”** (attacks **Pivot P2: “the value of the future is well-described as a *product* of many relatively independent factors… so doing poorly on any one dimension loses most value”**). The essay’s toy model assumes near-independence across dimensions like digital welfare, population ethics, resource allocation, diversity, etc., but many of these are plausibly *causally and normatively coupled* in the same direction by underlying institutions (e.g., better deliberation/rights norms simultaneously improve treatment of digital beings, reduce extreme suffering, and improve governance of expansion). If the dimensions are positively correlated rather than independent uniforms, the distribution of overall value becomes far less skewed—high scores “come together” instead of being multiplicatively rare. In that world, “mostly-great” futures can be common even if each dimension is imperfect, because competence in one area is evidence of competence in others. If this objection holds, the paper’s core inference—“fragility ⇒ narrow target ⇒ no easy eutopia”—stops following from the product model. The authors would need to justify independence (or show robustness under empirically grounded correlation structures), not just illustrate skew with an independence toy case.
