**"The ‘Everyone Approves’ Contradiction"**: A repeated move is: “even in a world everyone approves of, and everyone gets most of what they want, the future could lose most of its value” (§2.1–2.3). But if “value” is defined via a betterness relation that is supposed to represent moral truth (and then quantified via VNM), the appeal to universal approval is irrelevant unless you are smuggling in a preference-based metaethic; otherwise it’s rhetorical cover that obscures that your argument depends on *strong moral realism plus widespread, stable moral error even under extreme information/abundance*. Step-by-step: (i) you frame moral catastrophe as compatible with universal endorsement; (ii) you then use that to claim “single flaws are easy to introduce”; (iii) but universal endorsement in an abundant, technologically mature society is itself strong evidence (on many of your own listed moral perspectives) that the alleged “flaw” isn’t a flaw or is at least not massively value-destroying. The self-undermining move is using “everyone approves” to make the scenario feel safe while simultaneously insisting moral truth can condemn it by 50%+—without explaining why approval systematically anti-tracks moral truth even after the kinds of epistemic improvements your future assumes. If this objection holds, you must either (a) explicitly commit to and defend a metaethical story where endorsement is weak evidence (and why), or (b) stop leaning on “everyone approves/gets what they want” as a stabilizing condition in your fragility examples.
