**Load-bearing claim:**
“Even a universe-spanning civilization could fall far short because value-per-resource across uses is fat-tailed, so only very specific configurations achieve near-max value.”

**Attack type:**
Reference class failure

The paper leans on fat tails in wealth, citations, and consumer surplus to infer fat tails in *moral value efficiency* of future resource uses, but those reference classes are dominated by competitive selection, network effects, and measurement artifacts that need not exist for well-engineered experiences or welfare production. A future optimizer with powerful search and feedback might smooth the distribution: once you know the recipe for high-value experience, you can replicate it widely, turning “rare peaks” into a manufacturable plateau rather than a needle-in-haystack. If this critique holds, “fat tails → narrow target” no longer follows; the paper would need to argue that the value landscape remains rugged even under advanced optimization and that near-optimal designs cannot be replicated or generalized.
