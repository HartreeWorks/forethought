> The "no one's optimising" baseline ignores that powerful actors *are* already optimising—for control and rent extraction—so the real risk isn't philosophical error but governance captured into stable, low-flourishing lock-in.

Your “no serious, coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes de dicto” baseline distribution (Sec. 3.1) is institutionally naïve because it assumes the absence of “coordinated efforts” yields something like neutral drift rather than dominance by concentrated interests. In reality, the default is not “no one optimizes”; it is that actors with scalable power (states, megacorps, security services) optimize hard for legibility, control, and rent extraction, then launder that as “freedom” or “rights.” This directly targets your common-sense-utopia setup where “collaboration and bargaining replace war” and “scientific progress moves ahead without endangering the world” (Sec. 2.2): captured institutions systematically reintroduce conflict and hazard when profitable or geopolitically useful. The concrete consequence is that your paper’s catalog of moral-catastrophe failure modes is mis-specified: the key risk is not philosophical “getting population ethics wrong,” it’s that governance becomes compliance theatre and the future gets locked into a low-flourishing equilibrium that looks stable and benevolent on paper.
