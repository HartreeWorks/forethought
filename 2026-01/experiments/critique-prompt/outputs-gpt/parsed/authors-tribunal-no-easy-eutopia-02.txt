> The paper's "mostly-great futures are rare" claim rests on multiplying independent risk factors, but real-world dimensions like governance and rights are deeply correlated, so high-value outcomes may be far more common than the toy model suggests.

**“Multiplicative Fragility Without Independence”** — A load-bearing step is the move from “there are many ways to go wrong” to “mostly-great futures are rare,” supported by the toy model where value is the product of many *independent* factors (Sec. 2.4). The concrete failure mechanism is that real-world “dimensions” (rights for digital beings, governance quality, suffering control, resource allocation, etc.) are not plausibly independent: they are coupled by common institutions (law, oversight), shared epistemics, and by the fact that competence/values that improve one dimension often improve many others. Positive correlation and “bundling” can produce a distribution where high overall value is *more* common than the independent-product model implies, and where the main risk is a few correlated failure clusters rather than many quasi-independent traps. If this objection holds, the paper would need to replace the independence-based product story with a model that allows correlations/latent variables (e.g., “governance competence” or “moral circle expansion”) and demonstrate that “no easy eutopia” still follows under empirically plausible correlation structures.
