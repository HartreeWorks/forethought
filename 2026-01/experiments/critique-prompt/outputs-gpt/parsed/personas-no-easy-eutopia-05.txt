[The Capability Accelerationist] You treat scale—galaxy settlement, explosive industrial expansion driven by AI—as available conditional on “survival” (Sec. 2.3.4, 3.2), then evaluate moral views that demand near-total resource capture as “fussy.” But the paper implicitly recommends steering/optimization to hit a narrow eutopian target, and any steering apparatus that’s strong enough to control values and allocation at cosmic scale is itself a capabilities accelerant: it increases coordination, planning, and deployment speed. That means your “safety vs flourishing” framing is internally inconsistent: the interventions suggested by your diagnosis push the world toward whoever can build and wield the strongest optimizer fastest. The concrete consequence is that, under competitive dynamics, your message “eutopia is hard and needs deliberate optimization” could speed up the very expansions and lock-ins that make catastrophic value-misspecification irreversible.
