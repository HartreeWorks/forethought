The “scale-insensitivity” section argues that commonsense utopia may miss most value by being too small (solar-system limited), implying many futures that feel great are <0.5 on linear/unbounded views. The fragile beam is the assumption that “best feasible” includes capturing ~all accessible cosmic resources and that failing to do so is a *moral* shortfall rather than a mere missed opportunity; this depends on strong cosmopolitan/expansionist premises. Counter-example: a moral theory that treats expansion beyond some point as morally optional (or even morally risky due to harm externalities, corruption, or rights-violations in colonization) can rank a stable, contained utopia as >0.5 of best feasible *because best feasible itself is defined by quality not maximal scale*. The revision required is to separate “feasible maximum scale” from “morally mandatory scale,” and to justify why “best feasible” should be pegged to near-maximal expansion rather than to a satisficing-quality benchmark.
