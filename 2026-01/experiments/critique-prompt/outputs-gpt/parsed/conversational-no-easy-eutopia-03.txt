**"The multiplicative ‘product of factors’ model is an unearned structural assumption"**  
Modeling value as the product of many quasi-independent dimensions is doing substantial work: it makes near-best outcomes exponentially rare and makes single flaws devastating. But many moral theories and practical evaluative frameworks are closer to additive, maximin-ish, or “threshold then diminishing returns” structures, where doing well on most dimensions still yields a large fraction of value. Real moral gains can also be strongly substitutable: e.g., huge reductions in intense suffering may outweigh moderate shortfalls in aesthetic diversity or vice versa, depending on the view. Independence is also implausible; moral progress on one axis (e.g., better epistemics, better institutions) tends to improve performance on others, weakening the “one slip ruins everything” effect. If the product structure is wrong, the paper’s core intuition—that mostly-great futures are intrinsically fragile—loses much of its force.
