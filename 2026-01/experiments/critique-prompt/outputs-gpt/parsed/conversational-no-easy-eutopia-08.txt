> The taxonomy of bounded vs unbounded views is too narrow—hybrid theories like threshold deontology or pluralistic frameworks could define "mostly great" as a large target, undermining the claim that fussiness afflicts most plausible views.

**"The bounded-vs-unbounded taxonomy may be too coarse to support sweeping ‘most plausible views are fussy’ claims"**  
The paper’s second-half argument leans heavily on broad classes (linear unbounded, bounded universal, bounded difference-making, separate vs joint aggregation). But many nuanced moral views don’t fit neatly: pluralistic theories, contractualist constraints with consequentialist tie-breakers, threshold deontology, virtue-ethical accounts of flourishing, or hybrid views with domain-specific aggregation. In those frameworks, “mostly great” might correspond to meeting robust rights/needs thresholds and then achieving a wide range of optional goods—potentially a large target. The paper’s claim that only a “narrow slice” of easygoing views avoid fussiness can look like an artifact of choosing a small menu of functional forms. Without engaging a broader set of moral architectures, the generalization to “most plausible views” is contestable.
