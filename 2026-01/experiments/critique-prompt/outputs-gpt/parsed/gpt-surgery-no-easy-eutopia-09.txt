**Load-bearing claim:**
In Sec. 3.3 you argue “**bounded views of universal value are approximately linear in practice**” because “Earth’s difference is tiny vs universe,” so concave functions look linear locally

**Attack type:**
Hidden parameter / Reversal

This hinges on a cosmological premise (vast/infinite universe with many alien civilizations) *and* on the moral view caring about total universal value rather than agent-relative or region-relative value. But if the universe is causally disconnected beyond some horizon, or if moral relevance is restricted to the affectable region (common in practical ethics), then humanity’s marginal impact is not “tiny” in the relevant domain, and boundedness can be materially non-linear—making easygoing bounded views far less “narrow and specific” than you claim. Even granting a huge universe, many moral views treat “what we do” as evaluatively central irrespective of unobserved aliens (partiality, responsibility-sensitive views), again breaking the “approximately linear” step. If this critique holds, you’d need to explicitly condition the linearization argument on a metaethical assumption about global impartial aggregation over the total universe, and show your “most plausible views” actually accept that assumption rather than sliding it in via cosmology.
