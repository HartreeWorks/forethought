The paper’s quantitative framework relies on strong decision-theoretic assumptions (completeness, continuity, independence/VNM representability) that many moral theories reject, especially under risk or moral uncertainty. Even if some nonconsequentialist views can be represented with utility, the independence axiom and the permissibility of sharp tradeoffs (e.g., 50–50 eutopia/extinction) are controversial and may distort “fussiness” by construction. This risks turning a substantive thesis (“eutopia is hard”) into an artifact of the chosen formalism.
