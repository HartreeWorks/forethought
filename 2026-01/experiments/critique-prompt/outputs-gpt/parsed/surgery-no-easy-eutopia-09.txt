The load-bearing claim being attacked is: **“Because intertheoretic comparisons under moral uncertainty (variance normalization, pairwise reasoning) plausibly give unbounded views more say, our all-things-considered stance should be fussy in practice.”** **Attack type: Parameter sensitivity.** The “pairwise” route relies on contentious anchors—e.g., that utilitarianism and near–negative utilitarian limits “agree on the disvalue of bads,” then uses that to propagate a shared scale across theories; small changes in the anchoring judgments (e.g., whether extreme suffering is comparable across metaphysics of persons, or whether disvalue is separable the way assumed) flip which views dominate the mixture. The paper itself notes affine freedom, but then leans on “most plausible” normalization choices to recover fussiness; that step is doing heavy work without showing robustness across a reasonable neighborhood of anchoring choices. If this critique holds, the paper can’t claim that “fairest” uncertainty handling is itself fussy; at most it can say “some plausible methods yield fussiness,” which is a materially weaker governance-relevant conclusion.
