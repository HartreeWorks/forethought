"The Fat-Tail Reversal" attacks the inference “Fat-tailed value-per-resource on linear views ⇒ mostly-great futures are a narrow target, because most ways of using resources are far from optimal.” The same fat-tail premise also implies that even moderately competent optimization tends to discover outsized gains quickly: in many fat-tailed search landscapes, you don’t need near-perfect steering to get most of the attainable value; you need to avoid getting stuck in obviously low-value basins. The paper treats fat tails as making near-best usage exquisitely specific, but fat tails can instead make the top decile *dominant* and relatively easy to hit once you have scalable search (e.g., AI-assisted design, automated experimentation, copying the best-found configuration widely). In other words, fat tails can enlarge the “big target” by making “good enough” solutions abundant once optimization exists—even if the absolute optimum is rare. If this objection holds, the paper must distinguish “fat tails over all imaginable uses” from “fat tails over uses reachable by realistic optimization processes,” and show that reachable top-tier configurations are still needle-in-haystack rather than attractors.
