**"The Stochastic Dominance Boomerang"**: You lean on the claim that difference-making bounded views “violate stochastic dominance” (§3.3) as a major strike against the main easygoing candidate. But later you rely on VNM completeness/independence to set up quantitative comparisons and argue about gambles (e.g., the 60–40 eutopia/extinction comparison and the moral-uncertainty tables). The boomerang is that once you allow the kinds of intertheoretic normalization that drive your conclusions in §3.5, you recreate dominance-like pathologies at the meta-level: which gamble is “better” can flip purely by rescaling conventions that are behaviorally irrelevant within each theory. Step-by-step: (i) you reject views for violating dominance; (ii) you then adopt aggregation methods across theories that are not invariant under affine transformations unless extra structure is imposed; (iii) that makes the combined “betterness” sensitive to representational choices; (iv) so your own method can recommend dominated or arbitrarily switchable choices depending on normalization. If this objection holds, you must either supply a representation-invariant intertheoretic aggregation principle (with defended extra structure) or stop using dominance-based objections to rule out the only easygoing bounded slice—because your evaluative apparatus commits the same kind of sin in a new location.
