"Self-undermining move: you claim ‘no safe option’ across moral views, then build a thesis that depends on aggregating across moral views." In Section 2.3 you emphasize that almost any grand future will look catastrophically flawed from some reasonable moral perspective, implying deep pluralism and persistent disagreement. But Sections 3 and 3.5 then rely on representing “plausible moral views” in a common expected-utility framework and comparing fussiness across them in a way that is meant to guide real prioritization. If the pluralism bite is real, the paper’s own “eutopia is hard” claim becomes viewpoint-relative in a way that blocks the intended policy implication (“we should be pessimistic about default flourishing”). If the author defends by doubling down on the VNM representation as the “right” meta-ethics, they abandon the earlier rhetorical appeal to broad moral diversity; if they loosen VNM, the quantitative fussiness machinery collapses.
