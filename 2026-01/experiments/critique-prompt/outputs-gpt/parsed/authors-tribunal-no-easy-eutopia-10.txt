**“Narrow Target ⇒ ‘Needs Deliberate Optimization’ Is Not Shown”** — The paper’s concluding synthesis suggests: if mostly-great futures are a narrow range, then hitting them “must have deliberately optimised towards it” (end of Sec. 1; echoed in Sec. 4), positioning the next essay on convergence/compromise as the missing piece. The failure mechanism is that narrowness in outcome space does not imply narrowness in *basins of attraction* under plausible cultural/technological dynamics: strong convergent pressures (market selection, institutional learning, AI systems optimizing for revealed preferences, or coordination equilibria) can funnel a wide range of starting points into a small region without anyone aiming *de dicto* at “the best.” If so, the paper overstates what follows from “no easy eutopia”: the target may be narrow yet still reached by default dynamics, undermining the implied strategic pivot toward explicit steering. If this objection holds, the paper would need to separate (i) geometric narrowness in abstract value space from (ii) dynamical reachability under realistic processes, and avoid implying the necessity of deliberate optimization without modeling those dynamics.
