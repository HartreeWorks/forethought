"The paper’s ‘moral catastrophe’ concept collapses into ‘anything suboptimal,’ making ‘most value lost’ meaningless at scale." You repeatedly treat outcomes as catastrophically value-destroying because they fail to maximize on some dimension (insufficient scale, wrong rights, wrong welfare theory, wrong resource allocation), even when everyone is happy, free, and endorses their lives. Under your own normalization, “catastrophe” can mean “only 1/20 billionth of best” due purely to not expanding, or “negative” due to tiny bads in vast space, which makes ordinary moral language do misleading work. The result is that “no easy eutopia” becomes compatible with futures that are, by any non-pathological standard, spectacular successes—so the thesis stops discriminating between genuinely grim prospects and merely-non-maximal ones. If the author defends by insisting the scale really matters, they commit to the very fanatical implications they earlier flag as bizarre; if they soften it, the headline claim (“great futures are hard”) deflates into “the absolute optimum is hard,” which no one denied.
