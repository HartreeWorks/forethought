"Your conclusion is an artifact of defining ‘best’ as a percentile, not a property of the world." The entire framework defines a “best feasible future” as a 99.99th percentile outcome under a “well-informed” distribution, then measures everything as fractions of that benchmark. That makes “eutopia is hard” nearly automatic whenever the tail is heavy or the outcome space is huge—because percentiles in fat-tailed spaces are, by construction, separated by absurd ratios. The paper then treats this separation as a discovery about reality rather than a consequence of its measuring stick. This isn’t fixable by tweaking parameters: any defense that “we chose 99.99% for robustness” just restates the problem, because the fragility comes from percentile-normalization itself in high-variance spaces.
