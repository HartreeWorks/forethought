Your “**Common-sense utopia**” construction (Sec. 2.2) is used as a test case for “even if everyone gets most of what they want under abundance, value can still be far below potential” (Sec. 2.3). **Attack type: Hidden parameter.** The vignette builds in “do almost anything… as long as they don’t harm others” and “collaboration and bargaining replace war,” which already presuppose a highly competent harm-accounting system and stable governance that prevents externalities—exactly the kind of steering capacity that would also plausibly correct several of your later “easy-to-get-wrong” items (digital welfare, rights, bads minimization). In other words, your own definition of the utopia tacitly includes the navigation system you say you are bracketing (“no serious coordinated efforts”), making the scenario less of a “default” and more of a “partially solved alignment/governance” world. If this critique holds, you’d need to either (a) weaken the common-sense utopia assumptions to match your “no serious optimization pressure” condition, or (b) concede that once societies can robustly enforce “no harm to others” at scale, many of the claimed fragilities become less probable, shrinking the “no easy eutopia” gap.
