> The "one part in 10²² ruins everything" result hinges on where you set the saturation scale for bads—treat that as a free parameter rather than fixing it near one utopia's worth, and the extreme fussiness dissolves.

**Load-bearing claim:**
Your “**separate aggregation bounded views imply extreme fussiness: one part in 10^22 bad prevents mostly-great**” (Sec. 3.3) depends on treating “bads” as additively scaling with resources and on a specific mapping from “mostly-great = >0.5 of bound” to “a star-system’s worth of bad hits >0.5 of disvalue bound.”

**Attack type:**
Quantitative cliff

This is a threshold artifact of assuming the disvalue bound is reached at roughly “one common-sense utopia scale” of bads; but many bounded/separately aggregating views set the concavity so that disvalue saturates only after *enormous* amounts of bads (or weights bads sublinearly once protections exist), precisely to avoid “one speck ruins everything” implications. Once you allow the saturation scale (where additional bads add little marginal disvalue) to be a free parameter, your “1/10^22” brittleness no longer follows; it can easily become “tolerate a nontrivial fraction of bads without losing mostly-great,” which would make these views much less fussy than claimed. If this critique holds, you’d need to justify a principled choice of saturation scale for bads (not just “matches our intuitions”) and show that under those principled parameterizations, the extreme sensitivity result persists rather than being a tunable artifact.
