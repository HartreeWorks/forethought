[The Second-Order Catastrophist] Target claim: “mostly-great futures are rare” because many choices (digital rights, population ethics, discount rates, etc.) can be catastrophically wrong, so we should treat the target as narrow and “fussy.” Failure mechanism: if leaders internalize this, they rationally adopt hyper-vigilant control to prevent “moral error,” exactly the side-effect you briefly mention and then ignore (“too hyper-vigilant… overbearing, meddling, risk-averse”). Attack vector: Agent A (a safety regime) mandates a single global “reflective process” to avoid “wrong reflective process” and bans dissent as “value drift”; System B (open inquiry and pluralism) collapses because disagreement is reclassified as existential moral risk. Consequence: you manufacture an intellectual justification for permanent moral martial law—an authoritarian eutopia-attempt that is itself the catastrophe (total surveillance, forced value convergence, and suppression of minority conceptions of the good).
