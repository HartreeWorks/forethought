"The ‘Common-Sense Utopia’ Strawman and the Missing Stability/Institutional Story" — The critique of “easygoing liberalism” relies on the idea that even a future with freedom, happiness, minimal suffering, and robust cooperation could still be “tragically mediocre” due to further moral mistakes. Yet the paper does not address the possibility that the same institutional features that generate common-sense utopia—high capacity, transparency, deliberation, bargaining replacing war—also strongly reduce the probability of the listed catastrophes. For instance, a society that already achieves “minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings” seems far along a moral trajectory that would make digital welfare, oppression, and extreme injustice less likely, undercutting the “single overlooked flaw” narrative. Moreover, the argument often shifts from “could go wrong” to “likely to go wrong,” but common-sense utopia is described in ways that already bake in unusually strong alignment between power, welfare, and rights. If the target includes robust moral and epistemic institutions, many failure modes become endogenous and less independent. The paper would need to explain why the institutional package that yields the utopia does not also expand the eutopian target.
