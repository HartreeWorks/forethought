**“vNM-Completeness Filters Out the Robust Views”** — The paper restricts attention to complete moral orderings satisfying von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms (Sec. 3.1), then argues most “plausible” views are fussy. The failure mechanism is that many candidate “easygoing” or “robust” moral theories (incomparabilism, pluralist constraints, lexical thresholds, rights as side-constraints, permissive satisficing) are precisely the ones that reject completeness/continuity/independence or resist cardinalization across radically different futures; excluding them biases the space toward theories where tiny changes can matter a lot (hence “fussiness”). Because the paper’s conclusion is partly sociological (“most plausible views are fussy”), this methodological gatekeeping can predetermine the outcome. If this objection holds, the paper would need either (i) to defend that the excluded families are implausible *independently of the thesis*, or (ii) to extend the analysis to non-vNM frameworks and show that “no easy eutopia” survives under those decision procedures.
