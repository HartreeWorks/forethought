"Perverse instantiation: the paper’s ‘mostly-great’ world can be made rare by adding gratuitous dimensions." The “value as product of N factors” model is presented as capturing eutopian fragility, but it also gives a recipe for manufacturing fragility out of thin air: take any future you’d call “mostly great,” then refine your moral theory into more “relatively independent factors” (split autonomy into ten sub-factors, friendship into twenty, etc.). By the paper’s own toy model, increasing N mechanically drives almost all probability mass toward near-zero value, making “mostly-great futures rare” regardless of what the world is like. That means the central argumentative engine is not evidence-sensitive; it’s representation-sensitive. If the author defends by insisting there is a “true” factorization, they’ve smuggled in the hidden crux (a privileged decomposition of value) that their earlier moral-pluralism rhetoric explicitly denies.
