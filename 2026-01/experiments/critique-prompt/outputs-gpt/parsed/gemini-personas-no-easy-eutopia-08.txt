[The Historical Parallelist] Target claim: “initial periods of settlement and resource appropriation… will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us,” and allocation choices could “introduce lasting moral errors.” Failure mechanism: history says “initial periods” are not enlightened constitutional moments; they’re land grabs justified post hoc—doctrine of discovery, colonial charter companies, privatization shock therapy—followed by centuries of entrenched inequality and violence. Attack vector: Agent A (early spacefaring powers) repeats colonial patterns: first-claim property regimes, coercive labor analogues (digital indenture, copyable minds), and moral narratives about “civilizing the cosmos”; System B (your hoped-for moral diversity) gets extinguished by economic dependence and force. Consequence: your paper pretends we can cleanly choose an allocation scheme in a reflective way, but the actual attractor is conquest plus legal rationalization—so the “lasting moral error” you flag is not an edge case; it’s the default.
