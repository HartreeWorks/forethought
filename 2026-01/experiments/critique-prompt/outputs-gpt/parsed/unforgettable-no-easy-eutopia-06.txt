> If reflection can easily fix scope-insensitivity, then scale-related failures aren't robustly fragile under advanced deliberation, so the paper needs to distinguish which failure modes survive competent reflection rather than just current biases.

"Self-Undermining Scale Insensitivity" attacks the inference “Scale-insensitivity (not expanding, or choosing wrong population size) could be a huge hidden moral catastrophe ⇒ common-sense utopia can lose most value without anyone noticing.” The paper uses our current scope-insensitivity as evidence that future people may also fail to care about scale, but later relies on the idea that advanced societies can do deep reflection and/or be guided by truth-seeking processes (and that these might steer toward eutopia). Yet scope sensitivity is one of the easiest moral ‘bugs’ for reflection to correct, because it is largely a consistency constraint plus factual awareness about astronomical stakes; it doesn’t require settling contentious metaethics. If reflection plausibly fixes scope insensitivity, then the scale-based catastrophe is not a robust dimension in the product model—it’s precisely the kind of thing that *washes out* with intelligence and deliberation, undermining the argument that many dimensions remain independently fragile even in advanced conditions. If this objection holds, the author must separate “fragile even under competent reflection” failure modes from “fragile only under current biases,” and show that enough of the former remain to sustain the narrow-target conclusion.
