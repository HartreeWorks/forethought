**“The VNM Filter Pre-Decides ‘Fussy’”** (attacks **Pivot P3: “we’ll only consider views where the betterness relation satisfies VNM axioms… representable with a cardinal value function v… then mostly-great is v>0.5”**). The paper’s “fussiness” diagnosis is built inside a framework where (i) completeness and (ii) independence enable the kind of fine-grained, high-stakes tradeoffs that make tiny probabilities of extreme outcomes dominate—precisely the dynamic that often generates “fussiness.” But many moral views that people find plausible reject one or both in the relevant domain: they allow incomparability across radically different futures, or they reject independence for moral “options” vs “constraints,” which blocks the paper’s own pivotal comparisons (e.g., “60–40 eutopia/extinction vs guaranteed wonderful future”). If such views are on the table, the conclusion “most plausible views are fussy” no longer follows, because the paper has excluded a major route by which “easygoingness” could be formalized (e.g., satisficing, constraint-first, or incomparability-tolerant theories that do not treat near-best as a narrow numerical band). The main conclusion then becomes conditional: “given VNM-style cardinal comparability, many views are fussy,” not “easygoingness is unlikely.” If this objection holds, the authors need either to defend the VNM restrictions as capturing “plausible” morality in this context, or to re-run the argument under alternative decision formalisms where the narrow-target result might not appear.
