"Intertheoretic Normalization Whiplash" — Section 3.5’s deep dive on intertheoretic comparisons convinced major funders that the choice of normalization is decisive and that, on “fairer” comparisons, unbounded views should often loom larger—this became embedded in grantmaking formulas and national evaluation dashboards. The mechanism that broke was treating normalization as a technical choice rather than a social commitment: competing institutions picked the normalization that favored their preferred programs (variance-normalized upside bets vs extinction–best safety bets), each claiming philosophical legitimacy from the paper. The cascade was predictable: funding volatility spiked, long-horizon projects were started and canceled repeatedly, and safety-critical infrastructure (verification, auditing, incident response) suffered chronic underinvestment because it was rarely “first” under any single normalization. Over time, actors learned to game whichever normalization their overseer used by reframing outcomes (e.g., redefining “dystopia” categories or “best feasible” benchmarks) to move the denominator. The paper missed that importing intertheoretic aggregation into governance creates a *meta-game over the metric itself*, where the dominant skill becomes political manipulation of moral scales, not producing good outcomes.
