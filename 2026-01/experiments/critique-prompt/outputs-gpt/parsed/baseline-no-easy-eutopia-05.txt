The “multiplicative product of factors” model is presented as an explanatory backbone, but the independence and uniformity assumptions are both highly contestable. Many purported “dimensions” (e.g., autonomy, wellbeing, rights, diversity) may be positively correlated under abundance, governance improvements, and moral learning, which would make high overall value less rare than the toy model suggests. Treating value as a product also bakes in a strong substitutability/fragility structure (one low factor collapses value) that many theories deny.
