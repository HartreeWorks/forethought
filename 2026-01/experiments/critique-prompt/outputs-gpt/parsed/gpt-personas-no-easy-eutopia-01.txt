[The Empirical Hardliner] Target claim: your headline inference that “eutopia is fragile” because “single moral errors… erase a major fraction of the goodness of the world,” supported by the “ongoing moral catastrophes” list and historical analogy. Failure mechanism (measurement/identification failure): you never specify an observable criterion that distinguishes “we’re in a moral catastrophe” from “we’re merely below the best feasible future,” because across your own table (religious views, conservative morality, pro-life, environmentalism, communism), the label is driven by theory-relative thresholds rather than an identifiable welfare functional. That makes the key empirical premise—“large value is easy to accidentally forfeit”—non-discriminatory: any society can be called a catastrophe by some plausible-seeming view, so your evidence cannot update the probability that the future will be <50% of value conditional on “Common-sense utopia”-like material conditions. Consequence: the argumentative move from “many views condemn the present” to “mostly-great futures are rare by default” collapses into a semantic artifact of letting “catastrophe” track disagreement, not a claim about the underlying distribution of attainable outcomes.
