The moral-uncertainty section is structurally pivotal because it’s meant to show that even if some easygoing views exist, plausible intertheoretic aggregation will still make the overall stance fussy. The keystone inference is: “variance normalization or pairwise comparisons are the most plausible; both give unbounded/linear/fussy views disproportionate influence,” but the paper’s own examples show the ranking flips under reasonable normalizations, meaning the conclusion depends on choosing a particular intertheoretic currency. Counter-example consistent with their setup: adopt an intertheoretic method keyed to action-guidingness or choice-worthiness under bounded rationality (e.g., normalize by each theory’s sensitivity over the realistically reachable outcome set), and bounded easygoing views dominate practical decisions, making “mostly-great” comparatively likely and “no easy eutopia” no longer action-relevant. If this holds, the author must either (i) prove a representation-invariant dominance result (“fussy conclusions are robust across all reasonable normalizations”), or (ii) weaken the conclusion to be conditional on a specific intertheoretic comparison rule rather than presenting it as a broad implication of moral uncertainty.
