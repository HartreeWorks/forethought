> If your framework keeps generating pro-extinction conclusions for the least restrictive views, that's more likely a sign the framework itself is broken than evidence that utopia is genuinely hard.

"The Pro-Extinction Boomerang" attacks the inference “Most plausible easygoing bounded views have major issues (scale-tipping, dominance violations, pro-extinction tendencies) ⇒ easygoingness is unlikely, so we should accept fussiness.” The paper’s own argument repeatedly generates decision-theoretic pathologies (dominance violations, fanaticism, and pro-extinction under downside tails) and then uses those pathologies to discredit the *easygoing* slice, leaving fussier views as the remaining ‘plausible’ set. But those same pathologies arguably indict the *entire* framework of treating ‘flourishing’ as a single cardinal vNM value function over world-histories under deep moral uncertainty, especially when combined with cosmic-scale tails; the result is that “fussy” may be not a moral truth but a symptom of the modeling choice. The boomerang is that if your analysis implies that the least-fussy plausible views are systematically extinction-favoring, the more natural diagnosis is that your intertheoretic aggregation and normalization machinery is mis-specified—not that reality makes eutopia intrinsically hard. If this objection holds, the author must either defend why the vNM-cardinalization plus the chosen comparability assumptions are non-negotiable, or reframe “no easy eutopia” in a way that does not rely on machinery that predictably produces dominance and extinction paradoxes at scale.
