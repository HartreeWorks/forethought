**"The Action-Guidance Gap (So What?)"**: The conclusion says “no easy eutopia” doesn’t imply we’re unlikely to reach eutopia, because there may be convergence/compromise/gravitational pull, deferred to the next essay. But within this paper, the central claim—“most value lies in a narrow range; single errors erase most value”—is supposed to shift prioritization away from “survival-only” framing toward “flourishing-risk” seriousness. The mechanism breaks because, absent a concrete account of what steering is feasible, the narrow-target diagnosis is decision-theoretically inert: if the target is narrow *and* you don’t specify any tractable levers, the rational implication can revert to survival-first (since that’s the only lever with clear marginal effect), directly contradicting the motivating contrast with the “better futures” perspective in the introduction. Step-by-step: (i) you argue the upside conditional on survival is fragile and hard; (ii) you withhold the analysis of whether/how we can steer; (iii) then “flourishing work” is not justified as higher expected impact than survival work; (iv) so the opening motivation is left hanging. If this objection holds, the paper must be restructured so that the fragility claim is paired, in the same document, with at least one non-handwavy pathway showing how interventions can widen the target or increase hit-probability—otherwise the essay’s headline conclusion forces no major strategic revision and undermines its own raison d’être.
