"The Multiplicative ‘Product of Factors’ Model Lacks Justification and Is Potentially Misleading" — Section 2.4 proposes that future value is “the product of many relatively independent factors,” illustrated by independent uniform variables on (0,1), to argue that high average performance still yields low total value. But the independence and near-zero floor assumptions are precisely what drive the fragility: if factors are positively correlated (e.g., better institutions improve many dimensions simultaneously) or have saturating/threshold effects, the “needle-threading” picture weakens substantially. Many moral theories aggregate additively or lexically across dimensions rather than multiplicatively, and even pluralist theories often treat some goods as partially substitutable rather than strictly complementary. The toy model also presupposes smooth cardinal comparability of disparate moral dimensions (“autonomy,” “diversity,” “happiness”), which is exactly what many critics deny. Most importantly, the model is never connected to an empirical or theoretical claim that real-world moral progress behaves like independent draws from (0,1). The paper risks mistaking a vivid metaphor for an evidential bridge from “many concerns exist” to “near-best futures are extremely rare.”
