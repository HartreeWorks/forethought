> The "value = product of independent factors" model is maximally pessimistic about correlation—if societies that solve one hard problem tend to solve others too, mostly-great futures aren't nearly as rare.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The centerpiece “**value is the product of many factors** … ‘as N increases… expected value shrinks’” toy model (Sec. 2.4) is doing heavy lifting for “mostly-great futures are rare.”

**Attack type:**

The conclusion depends on (i) near-independence of factors, (ii) roughly uniform uncertainty over each factor, and (iii) multiplicative aggregation rather than min/lexicographic or saturating aggregation. A plausible alternative is strong positive correlation and governance-driven coupling: societies that solve “nonharmful freedom + cooperation” are also more likely to solve “digital welfare + bads minimization,” causing the joint distribution to have much more mass near the top than independent uniforms imply (the product model is maximally pessimistic about correlation structure). Moreover, many moral theories don’t treat “one bad dimension” as proportionally shrinking value; they treat certain constraints as side-constraints (pass/fail) or allow compensation, which yields a distribution shaped nothing like a product of uniforms. If this critique holds, you’d need to either justify why independence/uniformity is the right uncertainty model for future governance choices, or redo the fragility argument under correlated, clustered competence models and show the “rare mostly-great” result survives.
