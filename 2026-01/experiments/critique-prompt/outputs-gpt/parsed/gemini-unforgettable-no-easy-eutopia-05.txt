"Reversal result: your historical evidence supports ‘eutopia is easy’ via moral convergence and error-correction." The paper cites a long history of societies being “in the midst of moral catastrophe” and not noticing, and uses this to infer that future societies will also miss huge moral errors by default. But the same record is at least as consistent with the opposite: many once-normal atrocities (slavery, disenfranchisement, brutal punishment) became widely recognized as wrong through endogenous processes—economic change, information flow, institutional reform, expanding moral circle—without any coordinated de dicto optimization for “the best outcomes.” That is exactly the kind of default drift toward better states the paper is trying to deny. If the author responds that progress is contingent and incomplete, that concedes the data do not discriminate; their evidence stops supporting “no easy eutopia” and becomes compatible with “often messy, but strong attractors toward improvements.”
