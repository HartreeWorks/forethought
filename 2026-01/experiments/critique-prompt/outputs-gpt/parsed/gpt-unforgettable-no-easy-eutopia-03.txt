**"The Moral View Gerrymander"**: The essay’s inference that easygoingness is “a narrow slice of plausible views” depends on treating “plausible moral views” as a set that heavily counts highly theory-sensitive, exotic, and mutually incompatible criteria (acausal trade, simulation deals, infinite value, specific population-ethical fine structure) as genuine value-dimensions that can each erase “most value.” But the mechanism is selection bias disguised as pluralism: you inflate the dimensionality of value by counting any arguable consideration as a potential near-total veto, then infer the target is narrow because you made the target high-dimensional. Step-by-step: (i) take moral uncertainty seriously; (ii) treat many speculative considerations as live; (iii) allow each to carry “loss of most potential value”; (iv) conclude most futures are far from mostly-great. The hidden crux is that “plausibility” is being operationalized as “anything a smart philosopher could take seriously,” which makes fussy views win by construction. If this objection holds, you must impose—and defend—a principled filter on which considerations get to count as value-destroying dimensions (e.g., robustness to reflection, action-guidingness under uncertainty, empirical sensitivity), otherwise “no easy eutopia” is just “if we count enough vetoes, vetoes are common.”
