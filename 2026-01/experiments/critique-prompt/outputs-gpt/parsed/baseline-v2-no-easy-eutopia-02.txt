"Percentile-Based ‘Best Feasible Future’ Sneaks in Epistemic and Moral Controversy" — The paper defines “best feasible future” as the 99.99th percentile of a “well-informed probability distribution over all futures,” and then defines eutopia and mostly-great futures as fractions of that value. But the distribution is not specified: whose credences, what information constraints, what model of technological and political development, and what partition of “futures” count as distinct outcomes? Because the “best feasible” benchmark is distribution-relative, shifting priors can change what counts as “90% of best feasible” even if the world is the same, undermining the purported objectivity of the thresholds. Moreover, using a high percentile conflates feasibility with probability: some futures can be feasible but assigned tiny probability due to model uncertainty or neglected possibilities, which would distort the benchmark. This makes “mostly-great is rare” ambiguous between “rare among possible futures” and “rare under a particular forecasting stance.” The argument would be stronger if it separated metaphysical feasibility, technological feasibility, and subjective probability, rather than letting the 99.99th percentile do all three jobs.
