> The analogy between fat-tailed distributions like wealth or citations and moral value breaks down because those real-world tails are driven by network effects and measurement artefacts, not intrinsic value concentration.

"The Fat-Tail Argument About ‘Value-Efficiency’ Confuses Goods’ Popularity With Moral Value" — In Section 3.2 the paper argues that because many real-world distributions (wealth, citations, intervention cost-effectiveness) are fat-tailed, the distribution of “value-per-unit-resources” across future resource uses is probably fat-tailed, making mostly-great futures narrow on linear views. But citations, wealth, and cultural popularity are influenced by network effects, institutional incentives, and measurement conventions, none of which straightforwardly track moral value. Even in effective altruism, the observed “fat tails” in intervention effectiveness can shrink with better information, improved execution, and diminishing returns once the best opportunities scale up—features that might apply even more in a mature civilisation. Additionally, the inference from “some arrangements are much better than most” to “most resources must be arranged almost exactly in the best way” is not shown: fat-tailedness alone does not imply extreme concentration of optimality mass, especially if there are many near-optimal designs. The Russell/Dostoevsky anecdotes and the “most intense experience vs second-most intense” survey are also weak evidence for a heavy-tailed moral value distribution; they are compatible with reporting biases, incomparable intensities, and adaptive preferences. The paper’s conclusion that linear views require “very specific use” thus rests on an under-argued empirical analogy rather than a demonstrated structural property of value.
