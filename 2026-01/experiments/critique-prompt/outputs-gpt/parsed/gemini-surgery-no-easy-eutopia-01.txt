The paper’s first keystone is: “Conditional on survival, most futures are far below 50% of best-feasible value unless we deliberately optimize for ‘the best’.” The load-bearing inference is from “many ways to be wrong” to “default outcomes are usually < mostly-great,” which silently assumes a broad distribution over futures where moral error is roughly as likely as moral success on each key dimension. A counter-model fits their premises but flips the conclusion: suppose post-scarcity governance converges on a robust “procedural corrigibility” norm (no value lock-in, ongoing revision, reversible commitments), so most futures avoid large irreversible mistakes even without de dicto maximization; then lots of futures cluster above 0.5 even if none are near-best. If this critique holds, the paper must replace “many possible errors exist” with an argument that default dynamics systematically *select* for high-impact irreversible errors rather than self-correcting institutions.
