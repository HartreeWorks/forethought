"Speculative Claims About Digital Beings and Space Settlement Do Too Much Work" — Several major “easy-to-miss catastrophes” depend on highly uncertain empirical assumptions: that digital beings exist in vast numbers, that they have morally significant consciousness, that they are treated as property, that they receive votes, that they dominate politics, or that space resources will be rapidly appropriated and then locked in. The paper presents these as realistic enough to motivate strong fragility claims, but offers little argument for their likelihood conditional on “survival” and “common-sense utopia”-level institutional quality. Moreover, the moral stakes here depend sensitively on contentious theories of mind (functionalism vs biological naturalism), personal identity (what counts as “death” for digital beings), and political economy (how rights track personhood), none of which are defended. Without at least a structured uncertainty analysis, the discussion risks becoming a catalogue of science-fictional failure modes rather than evidence that near-best futures are genuinely narrow. If the argument is meant to be robust to empirical uncertainty, it should show that many independent high-probability failure modes exist, not just many conceivable ones. Otherwise, the conclusion may be an artifact of stacking speculative possibilities without weighting them.
