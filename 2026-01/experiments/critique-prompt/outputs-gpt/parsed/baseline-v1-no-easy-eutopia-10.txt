The treatment of bounded views and aggregation (separate vs joint goods/bads) risks oversimplifying the space of axiologies and may generate “fussiness” through stylized functional forms rather than necessity. For instance, the claim that separate aggregation implies that one bad part in 10^22 blocks “mostly-great” depends on a particular symmetry, scaling, and normalization choice; alternative bounded or thresholding frameworks (lexical priorities, pluralistic aggregation, sufficientarian constraints) could avoid both “scale tipping” and “near-zero tolerance for bads.” The paper portrays easygoingness as a “narrow slice,” but it does not convincingly rule out many non-utilitarian, pluralist, or satisficing theories that could make high-value futures comparatively robust.
