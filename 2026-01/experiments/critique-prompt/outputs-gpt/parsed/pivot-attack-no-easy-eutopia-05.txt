**“Fat Tails Don’t Equal Needle Targets”** (attacks **Pivot P4: “the distribution of value/cost… is probably sufficiently fat-tailed… so unless most resources are configured for the almost exactly most valuable kind(s) of thing, most achievable value is lost”**). The paper moves from “fat-tailed value efficiency exists in many domains” to “future value efficiency is so fat-tailed that only a tiny fraction of resource-uses are within 50% of optimum,” but that second step is doing the load-bearing work and is not established. In many combinatorial design spaces, you get *many* near-optima (broad plateaus) even when the top is extreme—meaning the tail can be fat while the set of “pretty close” configurations remains large. If there are lots of high-value architectures for minds, communities, art, discovery, and wellbeing, then unbounded-linear views would not imply a razor-thin target; “use resources for broadly flourishing lives and knowledge” could already land you above 0.5. If this objection holds, the paper’s claim that linear views are intrinsically “fussy” collapses, and with it a major plank of “only narrow slices of views are easygoing.” The authors would need to argue for *uniqueness* or *extreme sparsity* of near-optimal value-per-resource configurations in the relevant future design space, not just cite generic fat-tail prevalence.
