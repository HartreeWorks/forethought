**"Intertheoretic comparison problems undercut the moral-uncertainty-driven punchline"**  
The paper acknowledges that aggregating across moral views is thorny, but still uses examples where normalization choices swing recommendations drastically. That concession can be turned into an objection: if we cannot defensibly compare “stakes” across theories, we also cannot defensibly claim that easygoingness is unlikely or that fussy views should dominate expected choiceworthiness. In practice, the decision of whether linear/unbounded theories “loom large” can be an artifact of normalization (range, variance, pairwise) rather than a stable moral fact. So the argument risks becoming conditional: “If you accept these comparison principles, then fussiness follows,” which is much weaker than “easy eutopia is likely wrong.” A critic could argue that the right response is to adopt decision rules that are robust to intertheoretic scaling (e.g., bargaining, minimax regret, or parliamentary models), which often push away from the paper’s strong fragility conclusions.
