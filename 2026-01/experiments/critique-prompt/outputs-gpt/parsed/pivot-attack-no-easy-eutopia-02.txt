**“Multiplication Is a Choice, Not a Discovery”** (attacks **Pivot P2: “we can capture eutopian fragility by seeing the value of the future as the *product* of many factors”**). A product aggregator bakes in a very specific normative claim: that being 10% wrong on one dimension discounts *all* other dimensions proportionally, which is much stronger than the essay’s earlier “single flaws can matter a lot” intuition. Many plausible moral views instead use additive/separable structures with thresholds (e.g., “avoid extreme suffering” as a constraint, then aggregate goods), or maximin/leximin for certain bads, which can make the set of “mostly-great” outcomes *larger* than the product model implies. Under additive-with-thresholds, you can miss some speculative goods (acausal trade, infinite value, perfect population axiology) without collapsing overall value anywhere near the median. If the aggregator is not multiplicative, the quantitative punchline from the N-dimensions graph (top quartile at 0.034 when N=5) is not evidence that mostly-great futures are rare. If this objection holds, the authors would need either (i) an argument that most “plausible” moral theories approximate multiplicativity at relevant scales, or (ii) to replace the product story with one that survives across aggregator families.
