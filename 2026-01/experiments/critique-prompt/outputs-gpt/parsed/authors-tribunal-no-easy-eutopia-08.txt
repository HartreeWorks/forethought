**“Population-Ethics as a One-Way Ratchet”** — The paper uses population ethics to argue that even very good futures can miss “almost all value” by being too small, too large, wrong-lifetime, or wrong-being-type, making common-sense utopia easily non–mostly-great (Sec. 2.3.1). The failure mechanism is that this treats scope-sensitivity and additive aggregation as default, but a large and philosophically serious class of views (person-affecting, wide-person-affecting, average/priority variants, or views with strong thresholds/saturation) do not regard “more happy people” as linearly increasing value, and thus do not imply that a solar-system civilization is a rounding error. If many plausible views deny that “scale shortfall” is a catastrophic moral error, then one of the paper’s main “single-flaw” channels collapses and the overall case for narrow targeting weakens substantially. If this objection holds, the paper would need to either argue that scale-sensitive population ethics should dominate credences (with justification), or rerun the fragility argument in a way that does not rely on population ethics doing so much work.
