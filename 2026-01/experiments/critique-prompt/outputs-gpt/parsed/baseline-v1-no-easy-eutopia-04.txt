The discussion repeatedly assumes a well-informed probability distribution over futures “absent serious coordinated optimization,” but it never specifies how such a distribution could be grounded or why it should be stable across worldview shifts and technological regimes. Without a model of default dynamics (institutions, incentives, selection effects, learning, path dependence), the claim that mostly-great futures are rare is underdetermined: different plausible priors could make the “default” highly convergent toward welfare-enhancing norms. The argument risks being a catalog of possibilities rather than evidence about likelihoods.
