"The Governance Coupling Objection" attacks the inference “There are many disparate moral hazards (digital beings, wellbeing theory, space allocation, banned goods, etc.) ⇒ doing badly on any one can erase most value, because they are distinct contingent issues.” In practice, a small set of constitutional-level choices—rights expansion mechanisms, exit/voice structures, error-correction institutions, and constraints on coercive power—systematically control *how many* of these hazards can persist and at what scale. For example, a society with strong appeal processes for moral patients, reversible expansion policies, and competitive governance can correct mistaken bans, adjust digital personhood rules, and revise population policy without locking in. That means the hazard list is not “many independent darts to hit,” but “a few levers that create corrigibility,” making the target potentially much larger: you don’t need the right first-order answers, you need the right second-order institutions. If this objection holds, the paper must show that even highly corrigible governance still leaves a narrow eutopian target (e.g., because corrigibility itself is unstable, exploitable, or value-corrosive), rather than inferring narrowness from a grab-bag of first-order disagreements.
