A second keystone is the “multiplicative fragility” frame: value ≈ product of many independent factors, so missing one factor drives value near zero. The beam here is the independence assumption plus the choice of a product aggregator, which is doing essentially all the work in turning “several important dimensions” into “mostly-great is rare.” Counter-example: if the true structure is “lexicographic thresholds + redundancy” (e.g., once you clear basic thresholds on suffering, autonomy, and rights, marginal improvements have diminishing moral returns and failures are partly substitutable), then high-value futures are *not* exponentially rare; they’re common plateaus with occasional spikes. To salvage the argument, the author would need to show not just that multiple dimensions matter, but that (i) they are weakly correlated under default trajectories, (ii) they are non-substitutable, and (iii) typical shortfalls are *catastrophic* rather than marginal under a wide class of plausible moral theories.
