**"Scale arguments depend on contested population ethics and a controversial ‘bigger is better’ framing"**  
The paper often treats missing cosmic expansion or having “too few” beings as an enormous value loss on many views, pushing toward fussiness. But population ethics is famously unsettled, and many plausible positions reject strong pro-natal or expansionist implications (person-affecting views, variable value views with strong average constraints, rights-based limits, or uncertainty-averse aggregation). Even among totalists, the conclusion that “solar-system utopia is a rounding error” depends on assuming comparably high welfare is scalable and that adding lives is unambiguously good rather than morally optional. If population ethics uncertainty is taken seriously, it may argue for moral humility and robust satisficing, not for declaring that only a narrow set of vast futures count as “mostly great.” In short, the scale-based narrowing may be an artifact of privileging expansion-friendly theories.
