You argue that on linear views “there must be some single ‘value-efficient’ arrangement of resources” and that missing it makes outcomes far from mostly-great (Sec. 3.2), but you never specify the optimization target, admissible action space, or how “resources” decompose into separable parcels in an implementation-level model. Your separability talk quietly assumes an ontology where value contributions are modular and where “recreate as many arrangements as possible” is well-defined—yet your earlier examples (rights, voting power, preference engineering) are institutionally entangled, not parcelable. Without a formal model, the claim that linearity forces extreme specificity is handwaving: in many formal settings, multiple near-optimal policies exist due to degeneracy, symmetries, or broad basins. The concrete consequence is that your “narrow target” conclusion is unearned because it depends on unarticulated design choices (state representation, aggregation, constraints) that could make the target wide in any plausible formalization.
