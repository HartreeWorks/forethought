**"The Linearization from Cosmology Non Sequitur"**: In §3.3 you argue that if value is bounded over the universe as a whole, then because humanity’s marginal impact is tiny relative to the whole (given possible infinite/huge universe), the bounded function is “approximately linear in practice,” making such views fussy. But this inference quietly assumes the moral value function is smooth and locally well-approximated by a derivative in the relevant region—exactly where many bounded views get their point by *not* being locally linear (thresholds, lexical priorities, rights constraints, saturating goods with discontinuities). Step-by-step: (i) you move from “concave bounded” to “approximately linear for small changes”; (ii) you then claim this collapses bounded views into linear fussiness; (iii) you use cosmology (big universe) to force the “small change” regime; (iv) you conclude easygoing bounded views are rare. If the relevant bounded views are not differentiable/locally linear—especially once you include separately aggregating bads, rights, or lexical constraints—then cosmological scale does not rescue your linearization, and your taxonomy misclassifies a large region of views. If this objection holds, you must redo the bounded-view section with explicit functional forms that include non-smooth/threshold structures, or else drop the claim that “universal boundedness implies practical linearity implies fussiness.”
