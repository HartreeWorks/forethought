[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: you repeatedly rely on “given survival and material abundance, society could still ‘accidentally’ make a single moral error” (e.g., digital beings treated as property, first-come-first-served extrasolar appropriation) in a way that loses most value. Failure mechanism (incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift): in the very futures where resources are abundant and scalable (your 10^22-star framing), the equilibrium is dominated by actors who can seize, replicate, and defend control—meaning the default is not “accidental moral error” but *strategic* lock-in by whoever wins early capability contests. Your “no serious coordinated efforts to promote the very best outcomes de dicto” conditioning is irrelevant, because de re incentives (power, expansion, security) already create optimisation pressure toward extreme concentration and aggressive replication—exactly the regimes where minority “moral error” is not corrigible by later reflection. Consequence: the paper understates the severity and *direction* of default selection: your list of moral failure modes are not independent “risks,” they are equilibrium outcomes, so the realistic conclusion is not “mostly-great is narrow,” but “your reference class for default futures is systematically biased toward the values of early winners,” which undermines your later hope that convergence/compromise can rescue anything.
