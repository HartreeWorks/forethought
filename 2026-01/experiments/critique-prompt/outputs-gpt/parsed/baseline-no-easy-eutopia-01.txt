The central inference from “many moral views judge our world deeply flawed” to “mostly-great futures are unlikely by default” looks like a non sequitur. Disagreement and historical error show that moral failure is possible, but they do not by themselves establish that the space of high-value futures is narrow rather than broad or that progress is unlikely. The paper often slides from “can go badly in many ways” to “probably will go badly,” without a defensible probabilistic bridge.
