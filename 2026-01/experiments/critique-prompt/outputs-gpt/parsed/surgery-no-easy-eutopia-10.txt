The load-bearing claim being attacked is the paper’s overarching inference: **“Since most plausible moral views are fussy and eutopia is fragile, absent serious de dicto optimization pressure, most survival-conditioned futures fall far short of mostly-great.”** **Attack type: Equilibrium shift.** The analysis treats “no serious coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes de dicto” as implying weak optimization toward high value, but many optimization pressures are de re and endogenous: competition for legitimacy, migration/exit, market design, and conflict-avoidance can select for institutions that approximate impartial welfare (or at least reduce major moral catastrophes like extreme suffering) even without consensus on “the best.” These pressures can create convergent guardrails (anti-torture norms, welfare floors, anti-slavery analogs for digital minds) that compress the lower tail of value among survivals, making “mostly-great” substantially more common than the paper suggests. If this critique holds, the paper’s conclusion about rarity is overstated: it would need a model showing that de re selection dynamics fail to erect robust moral guardrails and that key catastrophes persist as stable equilibria even under abundance and institutional evolution.
