> If early mistakes in digital personhood or space governance are actually revisable through ongoing reflection and bargaining, the paper's case for catastrophic lock-in weakens dramatically.

**“Correctability Breaks Fragility”** (attacks **Pivot P1: “future catastrophes are easy… lasting moral errors… capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us”**). The argument relies heavily on *irreversibility*: early mistakes in digital personhood, space appropriation, or governance “lock in” and permanently forfeit most value. But many of the essay’s own examples (misguided wellbeing theory, scale-insensitivity, wrong equality norms, banned goods) are plausibly *revisable* under continued reflection, bargaining, and institutional evolution—especially in a stable, wealthy, non-warring “common-sense utopia” that preserves freedom of inquiry. Even for space resources, the strong irreversibility premise (“initial periods… capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available”) is contestable if expansion is gradual, if property rights are renegotiable, or if technical limits prevent permanent appropriation/defense of cosmic assets. If mistakes are often corrigible, then “mostly-great by default” becomes much more plausible: you can be temporarily wrong without permanently losing most value. If this objection holds, the paper would need to shift from “easy to accidentally introduce a single flaw” to “easy to introduce an *uncorrectable* flaw before reflection catches up,” and defend that timing/lock-in story with concrete mechanisms.
