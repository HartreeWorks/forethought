**“Aliens as a Hidden Premise”** — A key step for bounded views is: if value is bounded over the universe-as-a-whole, then because the universe is probably enormous and contains many alien civilizations, humanity’s marginal impact is tiny, so any concave bounded function is approximately linear locally (Sec. 3.3). The concrete failure mechanism is that this hinges on speculative cosmology/anthropic assumptions (many civilizations, vast morally relevant value already realized, our contribution negligible), and if those assumptions are wrong—e.g., we are early, alone, in a mostly-empty region, or expansion changes the total “universe value” dramatically—then bounded concavity could matter a lot and easygoing bounded views could be live. Since this premise is not empirically anchored, it can flip the paper’s classification of bounded views from “effectively linear ⇒ fussy” to “actually saturating ⇒ potentially easygoing.” If this objection holds, the paper would need to treat “many aliens / negligible marginal impact” as an explicit parameter with scenario analysis, and show the no-easy-eutopia conclusion across a wide range of plausible cosmic population assumptions.
