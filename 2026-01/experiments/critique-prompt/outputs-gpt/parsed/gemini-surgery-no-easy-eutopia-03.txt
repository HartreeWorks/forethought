The argument repeatedly uses “ongoing moral catastrophes across history” as evidence that future societies will unknowingly commit similarly massive errors, i.e., “non-obvious severe flaws are the norm.” The hidden lemma is an inductive step: past moral blindness implies future moral blindness at comparable scale even under radically improved epistemics, institutional checks, and moral reflection tools. Counter-example: history may be dominated by small-elite power structures and low-information conditions; in a future with high transparency, reversible policy experimentation, and AI-augmented moral debate, the *mechanism* that produced past catastrophes (coercive institutions + misinformation + inability to coordinate reform) is absent, so “catastrophe as the norm” no longer projects. If this holds, the paper must argue at the mechanism level—identify which failure modes persist even under improved epistemics and why they remain stable attractors rather than transient errors.
