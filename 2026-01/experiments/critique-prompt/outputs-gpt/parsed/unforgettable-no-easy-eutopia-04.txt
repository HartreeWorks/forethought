"Meta-Moral Convergence Undercuts Fussiness" attacks the inference “Across plausible moral views, there are many ways to lose most value ⇒ easygoingness is unlikely, because views remain fussy even after reflection.” The essay’s catalog of moral catastrophes relies on cross-view disagreement (religious, conservative, animal welfare, population ethics, etc.) to argue that almost any future will be condemned by *some* plausible view, hence “fussiness” is robust. But if reflective processes converge (even partially) on *meta-ethical constraints*—e.g., anti-fanaticism, anti-parochialism, and symmetry/veil-of-ignorance principles—then many of the listed “catastrophes” cease to be live cruxes within the set of views that remain plausible after reflection. In that case, the paper has quietly counted “views that survive plausible reflection” and “views people currently hold” in the same reference class, inflating the number of independent failure modes. If this objection holds, the author must either argue that reflection does not prune the catastrophe-generating views (and why), or re-run the fragility argument using only the subset of moral views that are stable under the kind of idealized deliberation the paper later treats as a possible guiding force.
