> The paper assumes grabbing more cosmic resources always adds value, but if aggressive expansion also increases catastrophic risk or lock-in, a deliberately smaller civilisation could actually score higher in expected value.

**Load-bearing claim:**
“On unbounded linear views, a mostly-great future requires using almost all accessible resources (e.g., a Milky Way civilization is ~1/20B of the value of the best feasible future).”

**Attack type:**
Quantitative cliff

This treats “accessible universe resources” as a fixed yardstick and assumes we compare futures by cosmic share, but it introduces a cliff at the cosmology boundary: if expansion is technologically feasible but *governance-costly* or *risk-amplifying*, then “using more resources” may reduce expected value by increasing accident surface area, conflict, or irreversible lock-in mistakes during expansion. In that regime, “mostly-great” could be achieved by deliberately *not* expanding aggressively—contradicting the necessity claim. If this holds, the argument that linearity implies extreme scale-maximization (and thus fussiness) breaks; the paper would need to integrate expansion externalities and show that marginal expected value of expansion stays positive across scales.
