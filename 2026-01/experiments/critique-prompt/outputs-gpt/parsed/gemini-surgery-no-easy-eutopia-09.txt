The “joint aggregation” attack (“scale tipping is intuitive nonsense”) is presented as a decisive implausibility, but it smuggles in an intuition about continuity of moral value with respect to balances of goods/bads that many coherent joint functions intentionally violate near thresholds (e.g., threshold deontology, catastrophe-avoidance). Counter-example: a moral view with a catastrophe threshold (any sufficiently large region of extreme suffering triggers near-maximal disvalue) can produce sharp tipping without incoherence, and can still be easygoing about *non-catastrophic* futures; then joint aggregation isn’t ruled out, and the “narrow slice” claim weakens. If this critique holds, the paper must replace “tipping seems weird” with a formal argument that such tipping violates the very vNM assumptions the paper itself adopts (continuity/independence), or else admit that rejecting tipping forces rejecting parts of the framework rather than the moral view.
