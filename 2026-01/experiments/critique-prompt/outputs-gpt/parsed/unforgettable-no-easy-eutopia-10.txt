> Maximising value at cosmic scale may require totalitarian control that's fundamentally incompatible with the liberal freedoms the paper treats as part of what makes a future good.

"The Hidden ‘Feasible’ Assumption" attacks the inference “Eutopia is near the 99.99th percentile of feasible futures ⇒ comparing typical futures to that benchmark shows huge ‘lost value,’ so mostly-great outcomes are rare.” The paper quietly assumes that “best feasible” is feasible under the same physical, computational, and coordination constraints that also apply to the futures in the baseline distribution—yet many of its motivating extremes (galaxy-scale expansion, ultra-efficient bliss states, acausal trade, avoiding any bads across 10^22 systems) may require levels of coordination, control, and verification that are themselves incompatible with liberal, diverse, non-totalitarian societies. If the true Pareto frontier has a hard tradeoff between “value-maximizing tight control” and “robust freedom/corrigibility,” then the best-feasible anchor is not merely hard to hit; it’s in tension with the very properties the paper’s common-sense utopia treats as part of value. That would collapse the paper’s central conclusion into an artifact of benchmarking against an internally inconsistent ideal (maximal value *and* broad freedoms *and* near-zero bads at cosmic scale). If this objection holds, the author must redefine “best feasible” with explicit compatibility constraints (e.g., requiring non-totalitarian governance and epistemic humility) and then reassess whether “mostly-great” remains a narrow target under that constrained optimum.
