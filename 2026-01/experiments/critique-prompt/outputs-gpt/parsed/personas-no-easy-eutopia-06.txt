> The very moral caution the thesis advocates could become a weapon—any faction can block rivals by claiming irreversible value loss, producing paralysis and centralised veto power rather than flourishing.

Suppose your thesis succeeds and society becomes intensely “fussy” about avoiding moral error across digital rights, population ethics, suffering, diversity, and so on (Secs. 2.3, 2.4). Then you create a meta-catastrophe you briefly mention but don’t analyze: a regime of perpetual moral precaution where every large-scale act is blocked by the fear it might be a “single flaw” that destroys most value (Sec. 2.3 “hyper-vigilant”). In such a world, the dominant political strategy becomes weaponizing moral uncertainty—any faction can halt rivals by claiming their plan risks an irreversible value loss (e.g., “wrong reflective process,” “wrong discount rate”). The concrete consequence is paralysis and centralized veto power: the institutions that adjudicate “moral risk” become the real sovereign, and the future converges to stagnant risk-minimization rather than flourishing—even by your own easygoing-liberal lights.
