[The Moral Parliament Dissenter] Target claim: the paper’s quantitative framing—“it’s rational to prefer a 60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction over a guarantee of futures that seem wonderful”—using a VNM-representable value function anchored at v(extinction)=0 and v(best feasible)=1. Failure mechanism (normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction): you smuggle in a “stakes calibration” across moral theories precisely where your own Section 3.5 admits there is no non-arbitrary intertheoretic scale; yet your intuitive shock test depends on that calibration being meaningful (otherwise “60–40” has no determinate normative bite). If a reader’s moral uncertainty includes incomplete/lexicalist views (which your setup explicitly excludes), then your “prefer the gamble” claim becomes undefined, not counterintuitive—so the rhetorical pressure you use to motivate “no easy eutopia” is parasitic on a controversial representability assumption. Consequence: you can’t simultaneously (a) rely on the “gamble vs wonderful future” intuition pump to motivate fussiness and (b) later concede that normalisation choices radically flip recommendations; the core “this should worry you” implication becomes an artifact of your chosen normalisation, not a robust conclusion.
