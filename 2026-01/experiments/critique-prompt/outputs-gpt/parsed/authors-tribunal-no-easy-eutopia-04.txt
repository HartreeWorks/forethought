**“Linear ⇒ ‘Use Almost Everything’ Overstates Scale Necessity”** — The paper’s inference that, on linear unbounded views, a mostly-great future requires harnessing “almost all available resources in the accessible universe” (Sec. 3.2) is doing major work to make common-sense utopia look tiny and to make the eutopian target narrow. The failure mechanism is that “available resources” is ambiguous between physically reachable, economically/coordination-feasible, and ethically permissible resources; the set may be sharply smaller than “20 billion galaxies,” and linearity alone doesn’t imply that failing to expand is a *moral mistake* rather than an infeasibility constraint that shrinks what counts as “best feasible.” If best feasibility is constrained by realistic coordination, speed-of-light governance, expansion risks, or strong rights constraints against tiling the cosmos, then a solar-system (or local-cluster) civilization could be near-best *relative to feasible sets*, making eutopia much easier. If this objection holds, the paper would need to incorporate feasibility/coordination constraints into the definition of “best feasible future” rather than treating cosmic-scale capture as the relevant benchmark for linear views.
