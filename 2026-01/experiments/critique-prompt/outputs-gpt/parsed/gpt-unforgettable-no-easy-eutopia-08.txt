**"The Fat-Tail Double Count"**: The essay uses fat tails twice in a way that compounds rather than argues: (i) to claim value-efficiency across uses of resources is fat-tailed (§3.2), hence only near-optimal configurations achieve most value; and (ii) to claim under uncertainty, expected distributions are fat-tailed anyway (§3.2), hence the conclusion is robust. But the second move amplifies the first by treating “uncertainty about tail thickness” as itself a reason to behave as if tails dominate, which collapses into a one-way ratchet toward fussiness regardless of actual evidence. Step-by-step: (i) posit a fat tail; (ii) assert that even being unsure implies an expected fat tail; (iii) infer most resource uses are far from optimal; (iv) declare mostly-great futures narrow. This is self-undermining because it turns epistemic humility into a guaranteed conclusion: any lack of knowledge about the distribution becomes support for the distributional assumption that makes your thesis true. If this objection holds, you need to replace the “uncertainty implies fat-tail in expectation” step with a decision-relevant argument (e.g., explicit priors over tail indices and posterior sensitivity) that can, in principle, come out *not* fussy—otherwise the paper’s core quantitative justification is structurally unfalsifiable.
