> The paper's claim that failing to expand is a massive value loss quietly assumes totalist population ethics—the very thing that's contested—making the "no easy eutopia" conclusion feel circular.

"Question-Begging About Scale and Population Ethics" — The paper treats “scale-insensitivity” as a likely mistake and suggests that a galaxy’s worth of flourishing could be “billions of times more valuable,” implying that failing to expand is a major value loss. But whether more happy lives add value (and how much) is exactly what is contested in population ethics; the argument risks assuming the conclusion—that a small but wonderful civilisation “misses out on almost all value”—by privileging totalist intuitions. Even within totalism, it is not clear that “bigger is better” holds once one accounts for opportunity costs, coordination overhead, risk of suffering, and diminishing marginal value per additional life (which the paper itself entertains elsewhere). Conversely, on many non-total views, expansion is at best morally optional and at worst morally risky, so “not colonizing” wouldn’t be a “moral flaw” but prudent restraint. Presenting population-ethical controversy as a source of fragility can therefore invert the dialectic: the fragility may stem from the paper’s choice to treat some contested views as plausible enough to dominate the stakes. A reader could reasonably conclude that the paper’s “no easy eutopia” result is driven by importing the most demanding population views into the benchmark of “best feasible.”
