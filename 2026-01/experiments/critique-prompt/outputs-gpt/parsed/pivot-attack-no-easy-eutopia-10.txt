> The paper's big conclusion hinges on a contested normalization choice—swap in a different intertheoretic scaling and easygoing views dominate, dissolving the "narrow target" result entirely.

**“Moral Uncertainty: The Conclusion Depends on a Normalization Bet”** (attacks **Pivot P3: “on the most plausible approaches to intertheoretic comparisons… unbounded views loom larger… so the fairest ways to evaluate options are themselves fussy”**). The essay’s final synthesis leans on a substantive claim about intertheoretic value comparison—variance normalization or the proposed pairwise scaling—yet also admits that normalization choices swing the ranking between “safety-focused” and “upside-focused” options dramatically. If a reader instead endorses a normalization that dampens unbounded tails (or treats bounded ‘common-sense utopia’ stakes as comparable to unbounded stakes), then easygoing views can dominate the aggregate, and “no easy eutopia” no longer has decision-theoretic bite under uncertainty. In that case, even granting the paper’s taxonomy of fussy vs easygoing theories, we cannot infer that we should expect a narrow target in the all-things-considered sense that motivated the paper (the initial “surviving vs flourishing” framing). If this objection holds, the authors would need to either (i) provide a principled, widely acceptable justification for the particular intertheoretic scaling that makes fussiness loom largest, or (ii) restate the main conclusion as conditional on contested metaethical machinery rather than as a robust upshot about the future being hard to make mostly-great.
