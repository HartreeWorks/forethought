**"The paper conflates 'hard to guarantee' with 'hard to achieve most value' and overlooks satisficing plateaus"**  
Much of the reasoning highlights ways to be less-than-ideal (wrong digital rights, wrong welfare theory, wrong resource allocation) and treats those as potentially wiping out “most” value. But even if ideal is hard to pinpoint, it doesn’t follow that the value landscape lacks broad high-value plateaus where many different moral and institutional choices yield outcomes that are, in any reasonable sense, excellent. The paper’s use of “mostly-great = >50% of best feasible” invites a brittle, benchmark-relative framing: if “best feasible” is astronomically high (due to cosmic scale or extreme bliss states), then almost everything looks like “losing most value” by construction. A critic could insist that what matters for practical prioritization is marginal tractability and avoiding clear disasters, not measuring everything against a possibly fantastical 99.99th-percentile ceiling. Under that lens, “easy eutopia” could be false in a perfectionist sense yet true in the only sense relevant to action: there may be many robustly wonderful futures that don’t require threading an implausibly thin moral needle.
