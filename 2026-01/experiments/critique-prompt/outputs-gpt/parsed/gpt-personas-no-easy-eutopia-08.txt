[The “Local-First” Policymaker] Target claim: the essay’s core question conditions on “no serious coordinated efforts… to promote the very best outcomes de dicto,” then treats “society” as a unit that might drift into or away from eutopia based on moral discovery and compromise. Failure mechanism (incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift): in actual governance, there is no “society” actor—there are jurisdictions, firms, factions, and militaries with local mandates, and your own examples (space appropriation, digital voting majorities, resource allocation) are exactly the domains where first movers gain irreversible advantages and refuse later compromises. The conditioning on “no coordinated efforts” doesn’t describe the default; the default is *partial* coordination within blocs plus sabotage across blocs, which yields patchwork rules that are selected for competitiveness rather than moral correctness. Consequence: your probability distribution over “futures conditional on survival” is misspecified: it should be dominated by jurisdictional lock-in and competitive deregulation, not by a global commonsense-utopia baseline that then “accidentally” gets population ethics or digital rights wrong.
