**Load-bearing claim:**
In Sec. 2.3.1 you treat “**scale-insensitivity**” as a major way common-sense utopia “could lose out on most value,” e.g., “a galaxy’s worth of flourishing could be billions of times more valuable.”

**Attack type:**
Reversal

Under many plausible decision procedures and political economies, strong scale-sensitivity can drive expansion races, resource appropriation, and conflict externalities that *increase* the probability of catastrophic lock-in or suffering (including digital exploitation), making the *easygoing* “small but high-quality” path higher expected value than aggressive scaling. That is, the same mechanism (“scale matters hugely”) can imply the opposite policy conclusion: don’t push scale because scaling amplifies tail risks and moral hazards. If this critique holds, you’d need to integrate an endogenous-risk model where the pursuit of scale changes the distribution over moral catastrophes, rather than treating “more scale” as a near-free multiplier on value conditional on survival.
