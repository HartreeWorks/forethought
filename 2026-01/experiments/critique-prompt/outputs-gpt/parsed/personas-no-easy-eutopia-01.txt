> The multiplicative-factors model assumes independence between civilisational outcomes, but shared governance competence would correlate them positively, potentially flipping the conclusion toward easy eutopia.

You lean on the claim “plausibly, the value of the future is well-described as a product of many independent factors” (Sec. 2.4) to argue that mostly-great outcomes are rare, but you never identify what observable mechanisms would make those factors independent rather than correlated. In real socio-technical systems, the same governance competence that improves “digital-being rights” also improves “resource allocation” and “avoidance of suffering,” creating positive correlations that break the multiplicative collapse. Without a causal story that generates near-independence, your toy model is just a rhetorical machine for producing pessimism. The concrete consequence is that your central quantitative intuition—“one flaw wipes out most value even when things go well on average”—can flip direction once correlations are admitted, making “easy eutopia” more likely than your argument allows.
