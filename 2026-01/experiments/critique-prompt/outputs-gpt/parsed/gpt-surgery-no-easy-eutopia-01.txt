The inference “**Non-obvious but severe flaws are … the norm across history and across moral views**” (Sec. 2.1) is used as a load-bearing bridge to “therefore a single flaw could undermine much of the moral lustre of the future” (Sec. 2.1–2.3). **Attack type: Reference class sabotage.** The historical cases you cite (slavery, disenfranchisement, brutal punishment) are not a random draw from “possible future moral mistakes”; they are clustered around coordination failures and domination under scarcity, weak institutions, and low epistemic capacity. A plausible counter-history is that once a society crosses certain thresholds (education, wealth, rights enforcement, global information flow), “catastrophes” of that specific kind become systematically harder to sustain even if people’s moral beliefs remain imperfect—meaning “moral catastrophe was common” doesn’t generalize to “moral catastrophe will remain easy under abundance + strong institutions.” If this critique holds, you’d need to replace the rhetorical historical survey with an argument that *future* moral errors are drawn from a reference class that remains high-frequency *after* the key civilizational transitions you implicitly assume in common-sense utopia.
