"Mostly-Great Becomes the Enemy of Better" — By defining “mostly-great” (≥50% of best feasible) and arguing that many attractive futures may still be far below it, the paper unintentionally made incrementalism look morally unserious to influential communities. The mechanism that broke was threshold-driven reasoning: actors reoriented toward hitting an allegedly narrow target rather than bankrolling diversified, compounding improvements whose value is large even if not “mostly-great.” Step by step, portfolios shifted away from boring-but-leveraged domains (public health, institutional anti-corruption, education, clean energy resilience) toward speculative “steering” interventions meant to secure the near-best trajectory; those speculative programs repeatedly failed because they depended on fragile coordination and untested theory. When multiple regional crises hit (pandemic resurgence plus food shocks), the neglected mundane capacity left states unable to respond, causing millions of deaths and a long authoritarian turn that also crippled moral deliberation and open science. The paper missed how humans—and institutions—convert evaluative thresholds into *budgetary cliffs*, even when the authors insist the threshold is “just a heuristic.”
