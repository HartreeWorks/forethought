"The bounded/unbounded taxonomy is a false fork: the paper rigs ‘plausible’ to mean ‘fussy’ by construction." The essay systematically prunes the space of theories: superlinear is dismissed, sublinear unbounded is dismissed, bounded-universal becomes “approximately linear anyway,” bounded-difference-making is called problematic, and the one family that looks easygoing (joint aggregation, low bound) is then tarred as narrow/implausible and possibly pro-extinction. What’s left is a curated museum in which every corridor leads to “fussy,” not because reality points there, but because alternatives are rejected whenever they would produce easygoingness. This is not a matter of adding citations; it’s a structural selection effect: “plausibility” is effectively operationalized as “yields the conclusion.” If the author defends by reinstating excluded families, they re-open the possibility that easy eutopia is common; if they don’t, the argument is just definitional gatekeeping.
