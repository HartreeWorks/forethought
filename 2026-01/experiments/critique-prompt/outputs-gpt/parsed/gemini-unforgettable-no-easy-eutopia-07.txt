"Hidden crux: the paper assumes a single, well-defined ‘true’ ranking of futures even while using moral disagreement as the main source of fragility." The argument needs moral error to be both (a) ubiquitous (many plausible views condemn futures) and (b) objectively catastrophic (there is a fact of the matter about which view is right, making the others ‘errors’ that destroy value). But the paper’s own examples rely on disagreements that look structurally underdetermined (population ethics, digital personhood, discounting, ‘objective goods’ vs hedonism) where the live possibility is not “we’ll get it wrong,” but “there may be no uniquely correct answer that makes talk of ‘missing most value’ coherent.” If the author defends by asserting robust moral realism, they must justify why that realism singles out one narrow set of answers rather than supporting broad permissiveness; if they retreat to anti-realism or constructivism, “lost potential value” becomes a projection, and the “no easy eutopia” thesis loses its bite.
