[The Security Engineer] Target claim: “Common-sense utopia” includes “Scientific understanding and technological progress move ahead, without endangering the world” and “Collaboration and bargaining replace war and conflict,” and you treat catastrophic moral failure as mostly about value mis-specification, not active adversaries. Failure mechanism (adversarial adaptation / Goodhart): the combination of galaxy-scale resources and fast-growing digital populations implies an attack surface where even a tiny probability of a hostile actor (or misaligned optimiser) per star system yields near-certainty of adversarial incidents somewhere, and “no bads” standards in Section 3.3 become unattainable under realistic threat models. Your own separate-aggregation argument makes this devastating: if one part in 10^22 being “bad rather than good” blocks mostly-great, then any security model with nonzero compromise rates implies “mostly-great” is effectively impossible, not merely rare. Consequence: the paper accidentally proves a stronger claim than you acknowledge—under adversarial conditions, your “fussy” moral views imply that scaling civilization *inevitably* disqualifies it from mostly-great, which collapses your later attempt to keep “no easy eutopia” from implying “eutopia is unlikely.”
