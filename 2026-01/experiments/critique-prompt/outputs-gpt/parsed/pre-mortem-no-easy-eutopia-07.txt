> The paper's case for treating humanity's impact as cosmically negligible hinged on a "big universe full of others" assumption that new technosignature null results undermined, but institutions had already locked in the dismissive framing.

"The Alien-Value Discount" — The paper argues that if the universe is vast and full of other civilizations, then bounded “universal value” views become approximately linear in practice, reinforcing fussiness; this pushed strategists to assume humanity’s marginal impact is tiny unless it expands aggressively and optimizes hard. The mechanism that broke was the underlying empirical bet: by 2032, high-confidence null results from wide-spectrum technosignature surveys and astrophysical constraints made the “many nearby moral patients elsewhere” assumption much less credible, implying humanity’s actions were not a rounding error but a substantial fraction of realized value. Yet institutions had already adopted linear-ish “marginalism” that treated local welfare and biodiversity as negligible compared to speculative cosmic expansion payoffs. The cascade was that Earth-system restoration and intergenerational public goods were repeatedly postponed as “near-linear minor terms,” leading to avoidable ecosystem collapses and health burdens that permanently reduced human capital and political cohesion—slowing every other long-run project, including space. The paper missed how sensitive its practical upshot was to contingent cosmology; it treated the “big universe” premise as a background intuition rather than a governance-relevant empirical hinge that required explicit robustness analysis.
