[The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: “value of the future is well-described as a product of many independent factors,” illustrated by the toy model “product of N independent uniform(0,1) dimensions” leading to expected value 2^-N and a thin top tail. Failure mechanism: the model is mathematically irrelevant to the domain because you never define the factorization, never justify independence, and never map any real decision variables (AI governance, expansion policy, rights regimes) to those “dimensions” with measurable uncertainty distributions. Attack vector: Agent A can pick any arbitrary set of “dimensions” (digital rights, diversity, discount rate, acausal trade, simulation bargaining, etc.) and tune N to force any desired conclusion (more N → “eutopia is fragile” by construction); System B (your purported quantitative intuition pump) becomes a free parameter generator, not an argument. Consequence: the paper launders vibes as math—readers walk away believing “most value is narrow” without a single implementable or checkable specification of what it would mean to “do well on all dimensions.”
