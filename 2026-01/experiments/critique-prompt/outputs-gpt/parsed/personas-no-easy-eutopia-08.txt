You claim “from many moral perspectives, the world is in the midst of an ongoing moral catastrophe” and use this pluralism to motivate eutopian fragility (Sec. 2.1), but your aggregation move quietly treats mutually incompatible doctrines as if they are commensurable dimensions in a shared value space. For example, “most religious views” and “communism” are not just different weights on the same goods; they embed incompatible meta-ethics, authority sources, and legitimacy criteria, so there may be no coherent “90% of best feasible value” metric spanning them. By assuming vNM-style completeness and cardinal representation (Sec. 3.1), you legislate away the very kind of moral pluralism you invoked to argue fragility. The concrete consequence is that your core rhetorical engine—“so many views see catastrophe, therefore single flaws easily erase most value”—rests on a value framework that many of those views reject, making your conclusion about “narrow targets” an artifact of imposed commensurability.
