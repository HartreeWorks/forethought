**"A narrow target in moral space doesn’t imply a low probability of landing near it"**  
The argument often moves from “there are many ways to be morally wrong” to “mostly-great futures are rare,” but rarity in the space of logically possible futures isn’t the same as low probability under realistic dynamics. Moral, institutional, and technological development can be highly path-dependent and constrained, creating attractors (e.g., stable rights regimes, robust welfare norms, coordination against obvious harms). If social evolution has strong convergent pressures toward reducing suffering, expanding circles of concern, and improving governance, then a “large target” might emerge endogenously even if moral perfection is hard to specify. In other words, “thin” sets can carry most of the probability mass when the generating process is structured. Without a defensible model of those dynamics, the inference from “many conceivable pitfalls” to “low likelihood of mostly-great outcomes” is under-argued.
