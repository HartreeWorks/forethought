The separate-aggregation bounded view critique (“one part in 10^22 bads prevents mostly-great”) depends on a load-bearing modeling choice: treating “goods” and “bads” as extensive quantities that each approach their own upper bounds as scale grows, so tiny fractions become huge absolute bads. Counter-example: on a bounded view where bads are “localized rights violations” that do not aggregate linearly beyond a saturation point (e.g., once institutions guarantee near-zero severe suffering, residual trivial harms don’t scale disvalue proportionally), a civilization with a star-system’s worth of mild bads spread thinly across 10^22 stars need not fall below 0.5. To revise, the author would need to justify why disvalue from bads remains extensive and unsaturating across scale (especially for bounded views), rather than assuming linear bad-aggregation while simultaneously exploring non-linear good-aggregation.
