"Vacuous truth: ‘mostly-great is unlikely without aiming at it’ is made true by defining the distribution as ‘no serious coordinated effort’ and then packing all goodness into ‘serious coordinated effort’." The key probability question is always conditioned on “no more serious optimisation pressure than today” from agents pursuing the best outcomes de dicto. That conditioning clause quietly removes from the reference class precisely the mechanisms most likely to produce high-value futures (institutional learning, selection for better governance, AI-mediated moral deliberation, competitive pressure to adopt welfare-enhancing norms). You then conclude mostly-great futures are unlikely “by default,” but “default” has been defined to exclude many default-like dynamics that have historically operated. If the author defends by saying “those dynamics count as optimisation pressure,” then the thesis becomes trivial: if you define “default” as “without the forces that improve outcomes,” then of course good outcomes are unlikely.
