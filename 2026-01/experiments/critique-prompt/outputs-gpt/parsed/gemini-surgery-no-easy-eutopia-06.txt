In §3.2 the paper leans heavily on: “For linear unbounded views, value-per-resource is fat-tailed, so mostly-great requires using resources in very specific near-optimal ways.” The hidden assumption is that the distribution of *marginal moral value* over resource configurations remains fat-tailed at astronomic scales rather than washing out via replication of many near-best patterns, and that the top tail is not broad. Counter-example: suppose there is a wide basin of near-optimal designs (many architectures yield within, say, 90% of maximal wellbeing density) because physics/compute constraints produce convergent efficient implementations; then the “specific use” requirement collapses and mostly-great becomes easy even on linear views. To repair, the author must argue that near-optimal basins are narrow (highly non-robust) in the relevant design space, not merely that some tails in current human domains are fat.
