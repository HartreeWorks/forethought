**"The ‘fat-tailed value-efficiency’ premise is speculative and may invert under maturity"**  
A major plank is that value-per-resource is fat-tailed, so the best configurations are vastly better than almost all others, making “mostly-great” a narrow target. Yet it’s unclear that moral value behaves like citations, wealth, or intervention cost-effectiveness once a civilization is technologically mature and can cheaply copy good patterns at scale. Many goods may be easy to replicate once discovered (e.g., a very good digital welfare design, or highly enriching environments), compressing the tail rather than stretching it. Moreover, optimization can also flatten differences: if future agents can iteratively test, measure, and improve welfare, they may quickly move into a broad plateau of “very good” designs. Without a more grounded model of what “value efficiency” even means across moral theories—and how it scales with knowledge—the fat-tail claim looks like an analogy-driven leap.
