**"Independence-to-Fragility Smuggling"**: The load-bearing move in §2.4 is treating future value as a product of “relatively independent factors,” then using independence to conclude that even high average performance yields low total value. The mechanism fails in the direction that matters: the factors you list (digital rights, population ethics, governance over resources, attitudes to suffering, etc.) are not independent given your own story—they share common drivers (institutional quality, epistemics, coordination tech, AI-mediated deliberation), so success on one strongly predicts success on others. Step-by-step: (i) you present many “single flaws” as if they were separately easy to introduce; (ii) you model them as independent uniforms; (iii) you derive a sharply skewed distribution where “mostly-great” is rare; (iv) you then treat that skew as evidence against easy eutopia. If correlation is positive (as your narrative about moral progress and capable decision-making implies), the product model reverses: competence-like latent variables create clustered outcomes, making “pretty good on many dimensions” far more common than your toy model predicts. If this objection holds, you need a model where the dependence structure is explicit (e.g., a small number of latent governance/epistemic variables) and show that “mostly-great is rare” survives plausible positive correlations—otherwise the central quantitative intuition pump collapses.
