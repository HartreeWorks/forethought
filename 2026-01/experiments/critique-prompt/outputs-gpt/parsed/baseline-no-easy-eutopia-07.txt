The scale arguments often presume that larger civilization size is straightforwardly available and morally required on “linear” or total views, while underplaying classic objections from population ethics and person-affecting intuitions. For many plausible positions, “bigger is better” is not obviously a moral mandate, and the paper treats resistance to scope-sensitivity as a cognitive bias rather than a substantive ethical stance. This framing risks stacking the deck by labeling dissenting intuitions as “misguided” rather than engaging the literature on average utilitarianism, person-affecting views, or variable value axioms.
