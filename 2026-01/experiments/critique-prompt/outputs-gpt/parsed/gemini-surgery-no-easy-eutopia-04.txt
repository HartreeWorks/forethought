In §2.3 the paper treats “people get what they want under abundance” as compatible with enormous moral loss via preference engineering (“they could engineer preferences to be satisfied with tragically mediocre circumstances”). This is a bait-and-switch between (a) a liberal desideratum of preference satisfaction and (b) an external metric of “true value” that can declare preference-satisfied worlds catastrophic; the paper uses (a) to set up intuitive plausibility and then evaluates with (b) to claim fragility. Counter-example: under a coherent preference-satisfactionist or procedural liberal view, voluntary preference modification that increases stability, meaning, and satisfaction is not a moral catastrophe but part of flourishing; the “mediocrity” verdict only follows on objective-list or non-voluntarist constraints the paper hasn’t earned. To fix this, the author must either (i) restrict the target audience to non-preference accounts and show they dominate moral uncertainty, or (ii) provide an argument that preference engineering is bad even by liberal/procedural lights (e.g., because it predictably violates informed consent, autonomy over time, or creates coercive preference markets).
