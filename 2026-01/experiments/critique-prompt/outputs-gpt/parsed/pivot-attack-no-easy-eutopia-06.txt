**“Separable ≠ Single Blueprint”** (attacks **Pivot P4: “linear views… are separable… so there must be some single ‘value-efficient’ arrangement of resources such that… you need to recreate as many of those arrangements as possible”**). Even if a moral theory is approximately linear/separable in resources, it does not follow that there is one canonical arrangement to replicate; separability only implies additivity across parcels, not uniqueness of the maximizing parcel-type. There could be a large set of parcel-level optima (or near-optima) that are incommensurately diverse—many different flourishing civilizations, arts, relationships, contemplative states, or discovery processes that each score similarly per unit resource. If so, then “aiming at a very specific use” is not required to hit “mostly-great”; broad competence plus pluralism could suffice, making the target much bigger than the essay claims. Denying the “single blueprint” inference lets an author accept linearity while rejecting fussiness—directly undercutting the route from linear unboundedness to “no easy eutopia.” If this objection holds, the paper must either prove a strong concentration result (most value in a tiny set of parcel-types) or weaken its central conclusion about narrowness for linear views.
