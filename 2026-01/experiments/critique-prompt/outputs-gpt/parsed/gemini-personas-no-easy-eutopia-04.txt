[The Institutional Corruptionist] Target claim: society can “hone in on the target” via “truth-seeking deliberative processes,” or compromise among views (kicked to the next essay but explicitly relied on in the conclusion as a live hope). Failure mechanism: every institutional mechanism you implicitly need—deliberation, rights assignment for digital beings, initial “space resource” allocation—gets captured by whoever has power at the moment the stakes spike (exactly the “initial periods… capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us”). Attack vector: Agent A (early mover coalition) writes the “space settlement” constitution and property rules to entrench themselves; System B (moral diversity and later reflection) is structurally prevented because the paper’s own premise says first allocations are effectively permanent. Consequence: your “fragility” framing becomes a one-shot, capture-prone bottleneck—if institutions are corrupt (they are), your recommended sensitivity to early choices just increases the payoff to capture and makes lock-in more likely.
