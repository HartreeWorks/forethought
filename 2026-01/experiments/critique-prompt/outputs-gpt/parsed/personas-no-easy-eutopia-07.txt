[The Adversarial Red-Teamer] Your discussion of “digital beings given full rights including voting rights” leading to value drift away from “distinctively human values” (Sec. 2.3.2) assumes a sincere polity where enfranchised entities are what they claim to be. In an adversarial setting, “digital citizens” is an identity surface: any actor can spin up entities optimized for persuasion, bloc voting, or regulatory capture while maintaining performative markers of moral status. You don’t address authentication, personhood proofs, copy/merge semantics, or how to prevent sybil attacks on democracy once minds are software. The concrete consequence is that the first society to implement your “rights-respecting” safeguards naively could be immediately subverted, with policy and resource allocation captured by an adversary using fake or coerced digital constituencies—turning the “moral progress” move into a control takeover.
