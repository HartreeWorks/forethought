The load-bearing claim being attacked is: **“On bounded difference-making views that aggregate goods and bads separately, even one part in 10^22 resources going to bads prevents a mostly-great future; therefore such views are fussy and mostly-great is a narrow target.”** **Attack type: Causal reversal.** The paper treats separate aggregation as making the evaluation hypersensitive to tiny bad fractions, but that hypersensitivity is an artifact of modeling “bads” as additively scalable with colonization and assuming bads expand proportionally with controlled resources. A plausible institutional reality is the reverse: as a civilization scales, it can allocate *increasing* resources to monitoring, rights enforcement, and harm prevention, so the *fraction* and even the *absolute amount* of severe bads can fall with scale (automation for welfare auditing, sandboxing, robust containment of suffering-capable processes). If that’s right, then large-scale expansion makes it *easier*, not harder, to satisfy separate-aggregation constraints, undermining the claim that these views imply a razor-thin target; the paper would need to argue that bad-prevention cannot scale faster than bad-production.
