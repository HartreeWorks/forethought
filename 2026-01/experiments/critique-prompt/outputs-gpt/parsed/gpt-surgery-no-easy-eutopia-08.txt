The argument in Sec. 3.2 that on **unbounded linear views** “to be mostly-great, almost all resources must be used and put toward some very specific use” relies on “fat-tailed value-efficiency” and the existence of a “single value-efficient arrangement” to replicate. **Attack type: Countermodel.** Imagine value-efficiency is *broad-plateaued* because many microphysical instantiations yield near-maximal welfare (e.g., any sufficiently advanced architecture can realize extremely high-quality experience), and the fat tail comes from rare *failures* (extreme suffering) rather than rare *bonuses* (extreme bliss). Then “most uses” aren’t orders of magnitude worse than the best; instead, a wide set of designs cluster near the top, and the tail risk is mostly about avoiding specific traps—flipping your conclusion from “must aim at a specific use” to “avoid specific anti-patterns.” Your analogies (wealth, citations, consumer surplus) don’t establish that *intrinsic* value-per-resource over future mind designs is fat-tailed in the relevant direction (huge upside gaps vs broad plateau). If this critique holds, you’d need to show that (a) near-max value is not a plateau for plausible mind designs, and (b) the tails are dominated by a few extremely high-value configurations rather than by “many good-enough” configurations.
