**"The Scale-First Reversal"**: In §3.2 you argue linear unbounded views make mostly-great futures require capturing most resources and using them in “very specific” high value-efficiency configurations, invoking fat tails. But under fat tails plus bounded rationality, the policy implication can flip: if value-efficiency is extremely spiky and hard to identify, the expected-value-maximizing strategy is to *avoid lock-in and preserve option value*, not to aggressively expand and configure the cosmos early. Step-by-step: (i) you posit huge upside concentrated in rare configurations; (ii) you acknowledge astronomical design space and high uncertainty; (iii) early expansion irreversibly commits resources to likely-suboptimal uses; (iv) therefore, the rational response is to slow down, sandbox, and defer irreversible resource capture until you can search/value-learn—contrary to the essay’s rhetorical push that missing specific targets is the central tragedy. This reversal matters because many of your “fragility” examples are precisely about premature lock-in (space resource allocation, value drift, early digital rights regimes). If this objection holds, you must either abandon the fat-tail + specificity story or explicitly derive when it recommends delay/option preservation rather than “narrow target, therefore we’re probably far” framing.
