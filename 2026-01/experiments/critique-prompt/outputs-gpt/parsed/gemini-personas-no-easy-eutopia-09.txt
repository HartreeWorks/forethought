[The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: the essay leans on von Neumann–Morgenstern completeness/transitivity/continuity/independence to represent moral views with a cardinal function v, then defines “mostly-great” as v>0.5 and eutopia as v>0.9, and uses that to argue about “fussy” vs “easygoing.” Failure mechanism: this is formal window-dressing that breaks the moment you include the exact phenomena you emphasize—lexical constraints, rights, sacred values, incomparability, population ethics paradoxes, and especially your own “near-term extinction vs eutopia gamble” comparisons which are notorious for violating independence under moral uncertainty. Attack vector: Agent A (any critic) constructs a plausible deontic view with incomparabilities or lexical thresholds (e.g., “no slavery” or “no rights-violations”)—which you already gesture at with “ownership of a being with moral status is wrong in and of itself”—and System B (your entire quantitative thresholding of 0.5/0.9) becomes undefined. Consequence: the paper’s “technical” section doesn’t discipline the argument; it narrows to a toy class of theories while still claiming broad authority over “most plausible moral views,” which is just false.
