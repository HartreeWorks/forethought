Key definitions (e.g., “best feasible future” as a 99.99th percentile outcome, “near-best” as ≥90% of its value) are arbitrary and may predetermine the “narrow target” conclusion. If feasibility tails are heavy or the distribution is misspecified, percentile-based “best feasible” picks a reference point that can make most outcomes look far away by stipulation. The paper does not justify why these cutoffs track any philosophically or practically significant boundary rather than merely providing a rhetorically striking contrast.
