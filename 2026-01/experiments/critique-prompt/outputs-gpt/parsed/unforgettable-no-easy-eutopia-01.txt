"The Multiplicative Mirage" attacks the inference “Many plausible moral views + many ‘dimensions’ of value ⇒ mostly-great futures are rare, because value is (approximately) the product of relatively independent factors.” The paper’s core load-bearing move is that a single serious ‘flaw’ can slash value the way one near-zero factor collapses a product, and the toy model is doing real argumentative work. But in real moral views, the same underlying institutional choices (e.g., governance of digital minds, property, and conflict) jointly determine multiple dimensions, creating strong positive correlations that destroy the ‘near-zero factor’ story: if you get the governance right enough to avoid one catastrophe, you often automatically avoid many. That pushes the distribution from “product of independent uniforms” toward “one or two latent variables,” which makes the target *much* larger than the paper claims. If this objection holds, the paper must either justify independence/weak correlation in the relevant moral risk dimensions or replace the product-fragility picture with a model where a small number of coupled design choices dominate (which may make eutopia meaningfully easier than argued).
