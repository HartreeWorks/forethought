> Widespread moral disagreement doesn't show good futures are rare—it might just show that many moral views are mutually inconsistent, so someone will object to almost any outcome.

**“Moral Disagreement ≠ Moral Fragility”** — Much of Section 2 motivates eutopian fragility by listing how many moral perspectives see single features as “catastrophic” (religion, conservative morality, pro-life ethics, environmentalism, socialism, animal welfare, etc.). The failure mechanism is that diversity of condemnation does not imply that near-best futures are rare; it may instead show that many moral views are *mutually inconsistent* or highly demanding, and that “catastrophe” is being used rhetorically rather than tied to the paper’s quantitative notion (e.g., <0.5 of best feasible). Without a principled aggregator or a defended credence distribution over moral views, “many groups would object” is not evidence that the eutopian target is narrow; it’s evidence that some people will complain in almost any world. If this objection holds, the paper would need to connect disagreement to expected value loss under explicit moral uncertainty handling (not just examples), or else decouple the main argument from sociological pluralism and base it on a smaller set of defended normative premises.
