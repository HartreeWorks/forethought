**"It selectively counts ‘moral catastrophes’ in a way that inflates fragility"**  
The paper highlights that many moral perspectives judge the present harshly, then uses that as evidence that future societies may also harbor non-obvious catastrophes. But a view declaring “most people follow the wrong faith” or “sex before marriage is catastrophic” is not just a different weight on shared values; it can be a fundamentally different ontology of value and authority. Treating any strongly dissenting doctrine as evidence of likely “catastrophe” risks collapsing into a kind of moral skeptics’ worst-case aggregation: the mere existence of disagreement becomes evidence that we are probably failing badly. That can overstate the probability of massive value loss by effectively giving heavy evidential weight to idiosyncratic or unfalsifiable evaluative claims. A critic could argue we should condition on a narrower set of morally serious, epistemically responsible views—or else the method becomes a disagreement amplifier.
