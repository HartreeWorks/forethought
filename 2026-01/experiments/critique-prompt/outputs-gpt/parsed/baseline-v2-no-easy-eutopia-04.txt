"From ‘Many Moral Disagreements’ to ‘Most Value Lost’ Is an Invalid Inference" — The paper argues that because many moral perspectives judge the present as a “moral catastrophe,” this shows how “easy it could be for a single flaw to undermine much of the moral lustre of the future.” But the mere existence of diverse moral verdicts does not imply that any one flaw actually reduces value by a large fraction on the correct theory, nor that future societies will systematically commit similarly severe errors. At most, it shows that evaluative disagreement is common and that hindsight moral critique is frequent. The move from “many perspectives condemn X” to “likely huge value loss” implicitly treats moral uncertainty as if it mechanically translates into expected value loss, without defending a method of intertheoretic aggregation that yields that result. It also ignores selection effects: some “catastrophes” listed (e.g., wrong religion, sexual norms) may become less influential or less credibly catastrophic under future reflection and pluralism, even on their own terms. Without a principled link between disagreement and expected disvalue, the historical survey functions more rhetorically than probabilistically.
