Several “moral catastrophe” examples conflate “controversial moral dispute” with “catastrophe-level value loss,” which risks question-begging against more pluralist or tolerance-friendly metaethics. Listing religious error, sexual norms, socialism, and environmentalism side-by-side treats each as comparably weighty evidence of fragility, but these views disagree radically about stakes and about whether the purported wrong is centrally value-determining. The paper uses diversity of moral condemnation as evidence of narrowness, but it could equally support the opposite conclusion: that many futures will be acceptable by at least some reasonable standards.
