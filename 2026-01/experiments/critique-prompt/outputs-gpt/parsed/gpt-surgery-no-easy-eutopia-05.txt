The move “**There are therefore many ways in which the future could lose out on most value for population-ethical reasons**” (Sec. 2.3.1) is leveraged to support the “narrow target” picture. **Attack type: Countermodel.** Consider a world where (i) institutions commit to pluralistic “moral parliament” governance, (ii) population choices are made via reversible, compartmentalized experiments (e.g., different habitats implementing different population ethics), and (iii) inter-habitat migration and value-trade are allowed. In that world, population-ethics disagreement doesn’t force a single global irreversible choice; it becomes an arena for diversification and compromise, making it much harder for population ethics to zero out “most value” across the whole future. Your argument treats population ethics as a single-shot, globally coupled decision, but a plausible future governance architecture makes it a decoupled portfolio problem. If this critique holds, you’d need to argue that (a) population ethics decisions are inherently globally coupled by physics (e.g., irreversible resource capture), and (b) portfolio approaches cannot preserve most of the value on most plausible moral views.
