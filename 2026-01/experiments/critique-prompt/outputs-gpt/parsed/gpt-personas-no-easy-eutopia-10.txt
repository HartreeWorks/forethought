[The Empirical Hardliner] Target claim: the fat-tail argument in 3.2 that “the distribution of value/cost over likely uses of resources is probably sufficiently fat-tailed” such that “a small fraction of resources achieve more than 50% of the value-efficiency of the most value-efficient resources,” making linear views fussy. Failure mechanism (measurement/identification failure): you slide from observed fat tails in wealth/citations and a cited consumer-goods paper to a claim about *moral value-efficiency* in astronomically large design spaces (e.g., “a brief and simple experience of bliss running on a computer the size of a sugar cube”). But “value-efficiency” here is theory-laden and non-operational: without a model mapping physical configurations to welfare/meaning/rights-status, the “fat-tail” claim is not just uncertain—it’s unconstrained, because any distribution over unknown utility-generators can be asserted to be fat-tailed. Consequence: the strongest part of the paper—the move from linearity to “very specific use is required”—rests on a speculative empirical regularity about the tails of moral value in extreme minds; if that regularity fails (e.g., many near-maximal designs exist), then your main technical conclusion (“linear views are fussy”) collapses, and with it the whole “no easy eutopia” punchline.
