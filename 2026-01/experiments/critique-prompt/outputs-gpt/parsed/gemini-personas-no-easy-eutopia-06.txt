[The Capability Accelerationist] Target claim: “given survival, widespread settlement… looks feasible, and even likely,” and “AI drives explosive industrial expansion… within years or decades,” while also implying we should be “fussy” about how resources are used to avoid losing “most achievable value.” Failure mechanism: fussiness doesn’t slow capabilities uniformly; it slows compliant actors and hands advantage to whoever ignores the “narrow target” philosophy and just builds. Attack vector: Agent A (a rival bloc) treats your argument as proof that Western deliberation will bog down in population ethics and digital rights disputes; they sprint to seize “extrasolar resources… claimed by whoever gets there first,” and System B (any chance at careful allocation) is dead on arrival because the first-mover advantage you describe dominates. Consequence: the paper is an acceleration manual for defectors: it tells them exactly where the bottleneck is (early expansion) and assures them the cautious side will hesitate.
