The bounded-views section asserts that if value is bounded “for the universe as a whole,” then because humanity’s influence is tiny relative to a possibly huge/infinite universe, concavity makes the function locally linear, restoring fussiness. This inference relies on a tacit move: that the moral value function is defined over the *entire* universe’s welfare-state, so our marginal contribution is evaluated against an astronomically large background of alien value. Counter-example: a perfectly coherent bounded consequentialism could be *agent-relative* or “domain-relative” (value defined over the agent’s causal cone or controllable region) without being the “difference-making boundedness” the paper later attacks; then concavity need not imply local linearity, and easygoingness can survive. If this holds, the paper must tighten the taxonomy: distinguish “global state boundedness,” “domain-relative boundedness,” and “difference-making boundedness,” and show that the non-fussy variants are either inconsistent or independently implausible rather than assuming the global framing.
