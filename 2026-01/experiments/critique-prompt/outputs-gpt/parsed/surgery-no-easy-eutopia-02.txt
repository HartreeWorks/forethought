**Load-bearing claim:**
“The multiplicative toy model (independent Uniform[0,1] dimensions) is a good guide to the shape of the distribution of achievable future value; hence mostly-great futures are rare by default.”

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

The conclusion depends sharply on (i) independence, (ii) the tail behavior near 0, and (iii) the number of dimensions N treated as if it can grow without changing the structure of civilization. If instead dimensions are positively correlated (moral reflection, institutional quality, and epistemics improve together) or truncated away from 0 by robust institutions (minimum-rights floors, automated welfare monitoring), the product distribution becomes far less skewed and the “top quartile is tiny” result can vanish. If this critique holds, the paper can’t use the toy model as evidence for “no easy eutopia”; it would need to argue for a specific dependence structure and for why “near-zero on one factor” is realistically common conditional on abundance and stability.
