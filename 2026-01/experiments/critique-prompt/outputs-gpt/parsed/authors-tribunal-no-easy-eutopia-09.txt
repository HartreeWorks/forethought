> The paper's claim that moral uncertainty makes us fussy actually depends on an unresolved choice of intertheoretic comparison method—and different methods could just as easily push toward easygoing policies.

**“Intertheoretic Comparisons Undercut the ‘Fussy Under Uncertainty’ Result”** — In Section 3.5 the paper suggests that on “most plausible” approaches to intertheoretic comparisons, unbounded views get more weight and thereby make decision-making fussy. The failure mechanism is that the paper itself shows normalization choice can reverse recommendations (safety- vs upside-focused option), and it offers no decisive argument that variance normalization or the proposed pairwise scaling is correct; yet the headline takeaway (“fairest ways… are themselves fussy”) depends on settling that dispute. If we cannot justify a particular intertheoretic scale, then we cannot infer that moral uncertainty pushes toward fussiness rather than toward more easygoing or more ambiguity-averse policies. If this objection holds, the paper would need to either (i) provide a stronger meta-ethical argument selecting a comparison method, or (ii) weaken the central conclusion to a conditional: “no easy eutopia on some comparison rules,” rather than presenting fussiness as the robust upshot under uncertainty.
