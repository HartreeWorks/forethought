[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: “fat-tailed value-efficiency” implies that to be “mostly-great” under linear unbounded views, “most available resources” must be configured toward “almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing,” otherwise “most achievable value is almost certainly lost.” Failure mechanism: if value-efficiency is fat-tailed, then competitive actors optimize for *appearing* to hit the tail while actually exploiting the tail narrative to justify extreme concentration (“we must allocate everything to the top-yield use”), which is perfect cover for monopoly and coercion. Attack vector: Agent A (a central planner or AI lab) claims they have found the “sugar cube bliss” or other ultra-efficient configuration and demands total resource control; System B (distributed correction, error discovery, moral learning) is eliminated because dissent is treated as wasting astronomically valuable tail opportunities. Consequence: your fat-tail argument doesn’t imply careful steering; it implies a predictable scam equilibrium where whoever can most credibly claim access to the tail seizes everything, and civilization gets locked into an unverified, possibly horrific “optimal” configuration with no escape hatch.
