"Your fat-tail move double-counts ignorance: you treat uncertainty about the tail as evidence the tail dominates." In Section 3.2 you argue: even if we’re merely uncertain whether value-efficiency is fat-tailed, the expected distribution is fat-tailed, so the conclusion is robust. That is a classic mistake: mixing distributions can create heavy tails in the predictive distribution without implying that the underlying world contains extreme realizable efficiencies accessible to agents (it can be pure epistemic variance). You then convert epistemic humility into substantive moral demandingness: because we don’t know, we should act as if the best uses are astronomically better and almost everything else wastes “most value.” If the author defends by saying “decision-making should respect heavy-tailed expectations,” they inherit the standard paradoxes of Pascalian fanatical reasoning—which the paper elsewhere treats as a reductio against linear/unbounded views—so the argument eats itself.
