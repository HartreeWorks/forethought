[The Capability Externalist] Target claim: you argue that on linear views “future civilisation needs to control most accessible resources” and must configure them in “very specific” high value-efficiency arrangements, otherwise “most achievable value is lost,” motivating fussiness. Failure mechanism (hidden coupling / systems interaction): your own recommendation gradient (take linear/unbounded seriously, prioritise capturing and optimising resources) increases competitive pressure to expand, which accelerates AI-capability development and militarises space settlement—precisely the dynamics that raise extinction and lock-in risks. In other words, the “linear view implies we should treat a solar-system utopia as ~0.00000005 of best” is not a neutral moral observation; it is a policy attractor that couples moral theorising to an arms race over the affectable universe. Consequence: if influential actors buy your linear-fussiness framing, they may rationally prefer reckless upside-seeking (your own 3.5 table of “Upside-focused option” vs “Safety-focused option”), pushing the world toward the very catastrophic tail your introduction contrasted against flourishing—your argument becomes self-undermining by increasing x-risk.
