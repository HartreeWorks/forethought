"Compromise is a Myth, So Don’t Try" — The essay’s emphasis that many moral perspectives can see even “common-sense utopia” as catastrophically flawed was absorbed by policymakers as an argument that broad moral compromise won’t reliably preserve value. The mechanism that broke was the overgeneralization from “disagreement exists” to “compromise is mostly value-losing”: negotiators began treating pluralistic bargaining as cosmetic, and shifted to winner-take-all constitutional designs aimed at locking in a single moral trajectory. The cascade was polarization: minority groups stopped investing in shared institutions, seeing the future as a contest for permanent control; this increased sabotage, radicalization, and secessionary movements, which in turn justified harsher central controls. In the resulting low-trust environment, even genuinely safety-motivated AI coordination failed (verification treaties couldn’t be ratified; audit data couldn’t be shared), increasing accident and misuse rates. The paper missed that moral diversity can be instrumentally stabilizing: compromise may be *the mechanism* that prevents any one faction’s moral error from becoming globally locked-in, even if compromise falls short of any single theory’s ideal.
