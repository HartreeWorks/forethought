The claim “**the suffering directly caused by animal farming may well be enough to outweigh most or all of the gains to human wellbeing… For this reason alone, the world today may be no better overall than it was centuries ago**” (Sec. 2.1) is doing more than scene-setting: it underwrites “even worlds everyone endorses can be morally catastrophic.” **Attack type: Dominant alternative.** A simpler explanation is that this conclusion is driven by adopting a moral aggregator that is extremely sensitive to large-N suffering (e.g., strong prior on totalist suffering-weighting), rather than by a general fact about “how easy moral catastrophe is.” If the “ongoing catastrophe” diagnosis mainly tracks one parameter choice (how to trade off nonhuman suffering against human gains, plus population aggregation), then it doesn’t support your later claim that *most plausible* views are fussy—only that *some* plausible views are. If this critique holds, you’d need to explicitly show that across a wide set of moral weightings and aggregation rules, a single domain like factory farming robustly flips the sign or crushes the value ranking, rather than leaning on one particularly leverageable moral premise.
