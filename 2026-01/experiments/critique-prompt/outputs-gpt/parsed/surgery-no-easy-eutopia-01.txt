> If civilisations can retroactively compensate for early ethical failures—restoring lives, offering restitution—then single flaws become temporary setbacks rather than multiplicative value killers.

**Load-bearing claim:**
“Value is well-described as the product of many relatively independent factors, so doing poorly on any one dimension wipes out most value.”

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

Construct a world where welfare-relevant factors are strongly *substitutable* and linked by repair dynamics: e.g., a civilization that is mediocre on “digital rights” early but later uses abundant resources plus reversible computing to retroactively compensate (restore memories/experiences, create vast additional lives, offer restitution) such that the long-run value is dominated by late-stage improvements. In that world, many single “flaws” are not multiplicative bottlenecks but temporary local losses with bounded impact. If this holds, the paper’s core intuition—“single flaws unwind most of the moral lustre”—fails, and the “narrow target” conclusion no longer follows from fragility; you’d need a separate argument that the key flaws are *irreversible* and *non-compensable*.
