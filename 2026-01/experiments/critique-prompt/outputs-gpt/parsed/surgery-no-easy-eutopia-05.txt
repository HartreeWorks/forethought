The load-bearing claim being attacked is: **“Future moral catastrophes are easy even in common-sense utopia; e.g., wrong population ethics, wrong treatment of digital beings, wrong wellbeing theory can forfeit most value without anyone discontent.”** **Attack type: Equilibrium shift.** Many of the proposed “easy mistakes” are not passive errors but would become salient political/economic fault lines once they carry enormous stakes (e.g., digital labor, voting power, ownership, lifespan design). Strategic actors (firms, states, digital constituencies) would litigate and bargain, generating equilibrium institutions (courts, treaties, constitutional limits, identity/firewall rules) that systematically push outcomes away from extreme exploitation or extreme disenfranchisement—not because society aims at “the best,” but because power contests create stabilizing constraints. If this holds, “easy mistake” is overstated: the default trajectory is shaped by strategic pressures that may *prevent* the very catastrophic corners the paper treats as readily reachable, weakening the inference from “there exist plausible moral errors” to “most survival-conditioned futures are far below mostly-great.”
