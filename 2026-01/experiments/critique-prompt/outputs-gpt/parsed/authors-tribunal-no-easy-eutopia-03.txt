**“The Fat-Tail Leap”** — The argument that linear views are fussy relies heavily on the claim that the distribution of *value-per-unit-resource over possible uses* is “sufficiently fat-tailed” (Sec. 3.2), so most resource configurations are far from optimal and you must hit very specific uses to capture most value. But the paper’s evidence for fat tails comes from domains like wealth, citations, and some intervention cost-effectiveness—domains shaped by human institutions and informational bottlenecks—then extrapolates to intrinsic value production in advanced civilizations, where design/search may be systematic and where many configurations could be near-optimal (broad plateaus). If the true landscape has wide near-optimal basins (e.g., many ways to instantiate high welfare, many computable approximations to optimal experience), then “specific use” is not a narrow target and linear views become much less fussy than claimed. To fix this, the paper would need either (i) an argument from computational complexity/search theory that intrinsically valuable states are generically needle-in-haystack, or (ii) explicit modeling showing that even with broad plateaus, most default futures still fall below the “mostly-great” threshold.
