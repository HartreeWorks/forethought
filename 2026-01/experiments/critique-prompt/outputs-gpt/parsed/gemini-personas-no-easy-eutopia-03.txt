[The Empirical Hardliner] Target claim: “future catastrophes are easy” and “single flaws can undermine much of the moral lustre,” including the line that “for this reason alone, the world today may be no better overall than it was centuries ago” (animal farming outweighing most human wellbeing gains). Failure mechanism: you provide no causal model, no operationalization, and no falsifiable prediction—just a list of perspectives and a rhetorical flourish that everything is a catastrophe depending on who you ask. Attack vector: Agent A (a policymaker) tries to use this to prioritize interventions, but System B (decision-making) has no testable discriminators: you never state what observations would update you away from “catastrophe,” nor what magnitude of animal suffering would numerically outweigh human gains under which welfare measures. Consequence: the paper functions as epistemic sabotage: it inflates moral uncertainty into paralysis, because any empirical debate gets waved away as “many moral views say it’s catastrophic.”
