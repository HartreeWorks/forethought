> The "scale is necessary" argument for space industrialization became moral cover for a security dilemma, turning philosophical claims about cosmic value into hair-trigger commitment races.

"Scale-or-Bust Geopolitics" — The essay emphasizes that under linear unbounded views, achieving a mostly-great future requires harnessing *most accessible cosmic resources*, and influential strategists used this to argue that delaying large-scale space industrialization was morally akin to forfeiting the future. The mechanism that broke was the assumption that resource capture is primarily a technical/logistical challenge rather than a strategic one: accelerating extraterrestrial appropriation predictably created first-mover advantages and commitment races. Stepwise, states subsidized autonomous replication and preemptive “claim staking,” which increased ambiguity and fear, which increased military escorting, which increased the probability of accidents and hostile interpretation. A single disputed intercept near a high-value asteroid cascade triggered a chain of retaliatory cyber-physical strikes on orbital infrastructure, collapsing global communications and power smoothing, and causing a deep economic depression on Earth. The paper missed that “scale is necessary” arguments can function as *moral cover for security dilemmas*, turning a philosophical point about value into a coordination problem with hair-trigger incentives.
