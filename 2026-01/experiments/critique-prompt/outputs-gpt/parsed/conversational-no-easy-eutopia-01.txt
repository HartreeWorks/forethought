> If you can't meaningfully assign cardinal numbers to how good outcomes are, the paper's dramatic expected-value comparisons might just be artefacts of the chosen formalism rather than genuine ethical conclusions.

**"The conclusion smuggles in a contentious cardinal, VNM-style ethics"**  
The paper’s central claim relies on representing “how good outcomes are” with a von Neumann–Morgenstern expected-utility value function, then treating distances like 0.5 or 0.9 as decision-relevant. Many plausible moral views are incomplete (incomparable outcomes), lexical (some wrongs trump any amount of good), or reject independence/continuity in morally loaded cases, which breaks the quantitative apparatus. If you can’t legitimately cardinalize value across the relevant outcomes, the paper’s “60–40 eutopia/extinction beats common-sense utopia” comparison may be a mathematical artifact rather than a real ethical implication. Even if some representation theorem applies, it may not be normatively appropriate to treat the induced scale as decision-guiding in the way the paper does. The “fussy vs easygoing” distinction is then partly a feature of the chosen formalism, not of the underlying moral landscape.
