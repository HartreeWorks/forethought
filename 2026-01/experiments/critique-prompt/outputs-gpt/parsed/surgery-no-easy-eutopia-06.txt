**Load-bearing claim:**
“If value is bounded with respect to the universe as a whole, then because the universe is very large relative to humanity’s influence, bounded concavity makes the view practically linear, hence fussy.”

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

The argument hinges on the ratio “human influence / total value of universe” being tiny, which depends on speculative cosmological assumptions (e.g., vast numbers of alien civilizations) *and* on treating those regions as morally similar and independent of our actions. If instead (a) the accessible/affected region is a non-negligible share of morally relevant value due to causal connectedness, simulation control, or rare-event dominance, or (b) aliens exist but are near-irrelevant under many person-affecting or deontic views, then the “small interval ≈ linear” move doesn’t go through. If this critique holds, the paper loses a major bridge from “bounded views” to “linear-in-practice” to “fussy,” and it must defend why cosmological scale should dominate the practical curvature relevant to our decisions.
