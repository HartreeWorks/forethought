"The ‘No De Dicto Optimization’ Incoherence" attacks the inference “Consider the distribution of futures conditional on survival and no serious de dicto optimization ⇒ mostly-great futures are unlikely, because the target is narrow absent deliberate aiming.” Many of the paper’s central failure modes (digital rights regimes, space resource constitutions, population-ethical choices, reflective lock-in procedures) are not optional ‘nice-to-haves’ that disappear when nobody optimizes; they are *forced choices* created by capability. Once a civilization can create digital minds or expand into space, it must instantiate some policy, governance, or default—i.e., it is already “optimizing” in the only sense that matters: selecting among institutional designs that determine outcomes. So the “no serious de dicto optimization” condition doesn’t generate a coherent baseline; it mostly selects for *unreflective* optimization dominated by whoever has power, which is precisely a specific kind of aiming. If this objection holds, the paper must replace its baseline distribution with an explicit model of default institutional selection under capability growth (power concentration, path dependence, coalition dynamics), rather than treating “no aiming at the best” as a neutral counterfactual.
