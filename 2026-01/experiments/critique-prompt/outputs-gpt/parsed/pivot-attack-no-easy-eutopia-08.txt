> The whole "bounded views are basically linear" move only works if you assume the universe is teeming with alien civilisations that dwarf our contribution—drop that cosmological bet and bounded concave views could actually be quite easygoing.

**“Cosmology Does the Work (and Might Be Wrong)”** (attacks **Pivot P5: “if the view is bounded with respect to the value of the universe as a whole… the difference humanity makes is tiny… so concave bounded functions are approximately linear in practice… and linear views are fussy”**). This pivot depends on a stack of empirical assumptions: that the universe is vastly larger than the observable region, that alien civilizations with moral status are abundant, and that their value contribution dwarfs ours, making our marginal impact “small enough” to linearize any concavity. But if the Great Filter is ahead, if moral-value-bearing life is rare, or if future light-cone control makes our influence a non-negligible fraction of morally relevant value, then bounded-concave views would not be approximately linear in practice—and could genuinely be easygoing (diminishing returns make “most value” achievable without extreme scale or perfect allocation). If the “aliens everywhere / our impact tiny” premise fails, the paper loses a primary route from boundedness to fussiness and therefore loses much of its claimed coverage (“most bounded views are fussy too”). If this objection holds, the authors must either (i) condition their conclusion on a specific cosmological/life-abundance worldview, or (ii) show that even in sparse-life cosmologies, bounded concavity still yields narrow targets at human-relevant scales.
