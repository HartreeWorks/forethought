> Frontier resource grabs don't lock in stable settlements—they historically trigger centuries of violent contestation and institutional collapse, so obsessing over the initial allocation misses the real danger.

Your “resource capture” framing—“initial periods of settlement… involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us” (Sec. 2.3.4)—treats first-contact with new frontiers as a one-shot lock-in event where allocation choices persist. History says frontiers don’t lock in; they metastasize conflict: early allocations (colonial charters, enclosures, concession companies) created enduring instability, revolts, and renegotiations, not stable moral settlements. The paper’s worry is “a lasting moral error” from initial capture, but the historical analogue suggests the bigger danger is centuries of intermittent violence and governance breakdown across distance, with norms diverging and enforcement failing. The concrete consequence is that your proposed focus on “getting the initial allocation right” misses the main driver of long-run value loss: chronic frontier contestation and fragmentation that repeatedly resets institutions and magnifies suffering.
