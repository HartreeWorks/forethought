> The paper's multiplicative model of value assumes independence between moral dimensions, but in practice abundance and strong institutions bundle them together, so improving a few lifts many—making the "one flaw ruins everything" picture overblown.

"The Fragility Fallacy" — The paper’s central claim that future value is well-modeled as a *multiplicative product of many roughly independent factors*, making mostly-great futures a narrow target, was operationalized in the late 2020s as a “no-single-point-of-failure for morality” governance doctrine for AI alignment and constitutional design. The mechanism that broke was the assumed *independence and near-zeroing*: in practice, key “value dimensions” (autonomy, wellbeing, diversity, rights) were strongly positively correlated once societies had abundance and robust institutions, so improvements in a few levers dragged many others upward rather than leaving a long tail of hidden catastrophic flaws. Because policymakers believed one overlooked dimension could wipe out “most value,” they built brittle veto-heavy institutions (multi-stakeholder unanimity, moral hazard boards, recursive review), which slowed deployment of safety-relevant infrastructure and made coordination failures routine. Rival blocs then defected around the gridlock, deploying less-audited systems and triggering the very geopolitical instability the doctrine was meant to avoid. The paper missed how institutional maturity and capability growth create *bundled* moral progress (correlated error-correction), so the product model systematically overstated the probability of near-total “value collapse” from one missed consideration.
