**"The Democracy Eats Itself (Digital Franchise Attack)"**: Your digital beings discussion (§2.3.2) treats “full rights including voting” as a plausible moral catastrophe because digital populations could grow fast and take over. But as written, this is an adversarial counterdesign: it gives any actor who wants control an obvious exploit—manufacture vast numbers of minimally qualifying “digital citizens” to dominate governance while claiming moral legitimacy. Step-by-step: (i) you propose/entertain rights frameworks keyed to status; (ii) digital beings are cheap to instantiate; (iii) voting power scales with headcount; (iv) strategic actors mass-produce aligned digital voters; (v) governance collapses into a rights-backed Sybil attack. The essay uses this as evidence that the eutopian target is narrow; but it’s actually evidence that your “common-sense liberal” institutional baseline is underspecified to the point of being non-viable in the very future you analyze. If this objection holds, you must substantially revise the institutional assumptions (e.g., anti-Sybil personhood criteria, non-population-proportional franchise, constitutional constraints) or else the digital-rights section stops supporting “fragility” and instead shows your baseline utopia is incoherent under its own conditions.
