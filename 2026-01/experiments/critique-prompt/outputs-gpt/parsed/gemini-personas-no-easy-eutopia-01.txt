[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: you can meaningfully evaluate “mostly-great futures” under a distribution “conditional on Survival” and “no serious, coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes de dicto.” Failure mechanism: actors will immediately reframe “mostly-great” into a political prize and then Goodhart the hell out of whatever proxy gets used (your own essay frames it as a prize worth preferring a “60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction” over gorgeous-seeming futures). Attack vector: Agent A (a state or lab) publicly adopts your “fussy” framing to justify extreme central steering (“we must optimize toward the narrow target”), while privately optimizing for regime survival and resource capture; System B (the supposed “navigation”) collapses into metric gaming and propaganda because there is no stable, incentive-compatible way to separate “de dicto best” from “my faction’s best.” Consequence: your conceptual setup becomes a coordination-killer—every actor defects into value-claims warfare, and the equilibrium is authoritarian control with performative “avoid moral catastrophe” compliance.
