"The Treatment of Moral Uncertainty and Normalization Is Inconclusive Yet Used to Support a Directional Takeaway" — The paper correctly notes that intertheoretic comparisons are “thorny,” but then suggests that “the fairest ways” of weighing bounded vs unbounded views make unbounded views loom larger, pushing toward fussiness. However, the critique of range normalization (that it would make cosmological discoveries arbitrarily change weights) does not by itself vindicate variance normalization or the proposed “pairwise” anchoring; each choice embeds substantive assumptions about comparability, stakes, and what it means for theories to “agree.” The paper’s own examples show that reasonable-looking methods flip the recommendation between “safety-focused” and “upside-focused” options, which undermines confidence in using moral uncertainty to buttress “no easy eutopia.” Moreover, the argument sometimes slides from “many plausible methods imply fussiness” to “therefore we should treat the world as fussy,” without addressing decision rules designed for deep moral uncertainty (e.g., my favorite theory, maximality, bargaining/compromise solutions) that do not behave like cardinal averaging. If moral uncertainty is as underdetermined as the paper admits, it is unclear how it can strengthen (rather than weaken) the paper’s central claim about the narrowness of the eutopian target. The result may be epistemic humility—“we don’t know how to aggregate”—rather than a justified tilt toward the fussy conclusions the paper prefers.
