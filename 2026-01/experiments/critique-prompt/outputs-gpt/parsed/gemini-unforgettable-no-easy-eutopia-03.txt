"Load-bearing metaphor: ‘eutopia is a narrow target’ quietly assumes a Euclidean geometry of moral space that no one has justified." The island/target analogy does the crucial work: narrow target ⇒ low probability of hitting it by default. But nothing in moral or social reality licenses the move from “many ways to be wrong” to “small measure of right outcomes,” because “measure” depends on topology and dynamics, not just cardinality of failure modes. In many real optimization systems, attractors are large: diverse initial conditions funnel into a few stable basins (e.g., convergent institutions, coordination equilibria), which makes “narrow” endpoints common, not rare. The paper never models basins of attraction; it asserts geometric narrowness as if moral space were uniformly sampled noise. Any attempted defense (“but there are many independent issues”) just repeats the metaphor instead of providing the missing structure that turns “issues exist” into “default probability is tiny.”
