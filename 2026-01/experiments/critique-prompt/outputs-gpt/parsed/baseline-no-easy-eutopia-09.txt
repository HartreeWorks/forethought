The “fat-tailed value-per-resource” premise is doing heavy lifting to claim that only very specific uses of resources yield most value, yet the analogy to wealth/citations is weak for moral value. Value might be smoother, more redundant, or more saturating than these social distributions, especially if many diverse lives are comparably good rather than dominated by rare peak experiences. Additionally, the move from “fat tails exist in some domains” to “future moral value-efficiency is fat-tailed enough to make mostly-great futures rare” is an unsupported extrapolation.
