[The Institutional Corruption Realist] Target claim: in 2.3.2–2.3.4 you suggest future societies could deliberate about digital rights, voting rights, and space governance, and might “get it wrong,” but the framing presumes a meaningful political system capable of implementing whichever moral answer is found. Failure mechanism (adversarial adaptation / Goodhart): any governance regime that tries to encode “minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings” or “no ownership of morally significant digital beings” becomes a compliance target for entities whose existence/agency is itself in dispute. The moment rights attach to “digital beings,” the highest-leverage move for power-seekers is to manufacture vast populations of borderline-qualifying entities to capture votes, resources, or legal standing; conversely, the highest-leverage move for exploiters is to engineer systems that *look* non-sentient to audits while extracting labour. Consequence: your “digital rights” dilemma is not a philosophical coinflip; it is a regulatory-attacker dynamic where either policy becomes gameable at scale, turning your proposed moral safeguard into an instrument for either takeover (vote inflation) or mass invisible exploitation (sentience evasion).
