**Load-bearing claim:**
“Jointly aggregating bounded difference-making views are a narrow slice and face ‘scale-tipping,’ making them implausible; thus easygoing views are unlikely.”

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

Consider a world where moral patients are protected by lexicographic or threshold constraints (rights floors) and within the feasible set value is jointly aggregated with smooth saturation—then “scale-tipping” can be avoided because below-threshold bads are prohibited rather than traded off, and above-threshold tradeoffs are continuous. That yields an easygoing view that is neither the paper’s “separate aggregation hypersensitive” nor its “joint aggregation scale-tipping” caricature, and it can be philosophically common (rights + welfare). If this holds, the paper’s taxonomy undercounts plausible easygoing views; its conclusion that easygoingness is “a narrow slice” becomes much weaker unless it can show that threshold/constraint hybrid theories are either unstable under reflection or still imply narrow-target outcomes.
