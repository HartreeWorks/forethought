1. "The Multiplicative Mirage" attacks the inference “Many plausible moral views + many ‘dimensions’ of value ⇒ mostly-great futures are rare, because value is (approximately) the product of relatively independent factors.” The paper’s core load-bearing move is that a single serious ‘flaw’ can slash value the way one near-zero factor collapses a product, and the toy model is doing real argumentative work. But in real moral views, the same underlying institutional choices (e.g., governance of digital minds, property, and conflict) jointly determine multiple dimensions, creating strong positive correlations that destroy the ‘near-zero factor’ story: if you get the governance right enough to avoid one catastrophe, you often automatically avoid many. That pushes the distribution from “product of independent uniforms” toward “one or two latent variables,” which makes the target *much* larger than the paper claims. If this objection holds, the paper must either justify independence/weak correlation in the relevant moral risk dimensions or replace the product-fragility picture with a model where a small number of coupled design choices dominate (which may make eutopia meaningfully easier than argued).

2. "Percentile Poisoning" attacks the inference “Define ‘best feasible’ as the 99.99th percentile ⇒ ‘mostly-great’ (≥50% of best) is a useful, action-guiding threshold, because value is ratio-scaled between extinction (0) and best-feasible (1).” The 99.99th-percentile anchor makes the whole framework extremely sensitive to tail structure: if the best-feasible region is driven by one exotic, low-probability-but-feasible construction (e.g., astronomical numbers of ultra-high-value digital experiences), it stretches the scale so that almost everything else becomes <0.5 by definition. That creates an artifact where “no easy eutopia” becomes nearly tautological whenever there’s any fat-tail upside, because the denominator is set by the most extreme feasible realizations rather than by what counts as “great” in any ordinary sense. This is paper-specific because the conclusion depends on the percentile-based normalization and the 0.5/0.9 cutoffs rather than on any single moral premise. If this objection holds, the author must defend why the 99.99th percentile is not smuggling in “fussiness by construction,” perhaps by adopting a scale anchored to robust central tendencies or by showing the conclusion is invariant under reasonable alternative anchors.

3. "The Fat-Tail Reversal" attacks the inference “Fat-tailed value-per-resource on linear views ⇒ mostly-great futures are a narrow target, because most ways of using resources are far from optimal.” The same fat-tail premise also implies that even moderately competent optimization tends to discover outsized gains quickly: in many fat-tailed search landscapes, you don’t need near-perfect steering to get most of the attainable value; you need to avoid getting stuck in obviously low-value basins. The paper treats fat tails as making near-best usage exquisitely specific, but fat tails can instead make the top decile *dominant* and relatively easy to hit once you have scalable search (e.g., AI-assisted design, automated experimentation, copying the best-found configuration widely). In other words, fat tails can enlarge the “big target” by making “good enough” solutions abundant once optimization exists—even if the absolute optimum is rare. If this objection holds, the paper must distinguish “fat tails over all imaginable uses” from “fat tails over uses reachable by realistic optimization processes,” and show that reachable top-tier configurations are still needle-in-haystack rather than attractors.

4. "Meta-Moral Convergence Undercuts Fussiness" attacks the inference “Across plausible moral views, there are many ways to lose most value ⇒ easygoingness is unlikely, because views remain fussy even after reflection.” The essay’s catalog of moral catastrophes relies on cross-view disagreement (religious, conservative, animal welfare, population ethics, etc.) to argue that almost any future will be condemned by *some* plausible view, hence “fussiness” is robust. But if reflective processes converge (even partially) on *meta-ethical constraints*—e.g., anti-fanaticism, anti-parochialism, and symmetry/veil-of-ignorance principles—then many of the listed “catastrophes” cease to be live cruxes within the set of views that remain plausible after reflection. In that case, the paper has quietly counted “views that survive plausible reflection” and “views people currently hold” in the same reference class, inflating the number of independent failure modes. If this objection holds, the author must either argue that reflection does not prune the catastrophe-generating views (and why), or re-run the fragility argument using only the subset of moral views that are stable under the kind of idealized deliberation the paper later treats as a possible guiding force.

5. "The ‘No De Dicto Optimization’ Incoherence" attacks the inference “Consider the distribution of futures conditional on survival and no serious de dicto optimization ⇒ mostly-great futures are unlikely, because the target is narrow absent deliberate aiming.” Many of the paper’s central failure modes (digital rights regimes, space resource constitutions, population-ethical choices, reflective lock-in procedures) are not optional ‘nice-to-haves’ that disappear when nobody optimizes; they are *forced choices* created by capability. Once a civilization can create digital minds or expand into space, it must instantiate some policy, governance, or default—i.e., it is already “optimizing” in the only sense that matters: selecting among institutional designs that determine outcomes. So the “no serious de dicto optimization” condition doesn’t generate a coherent baseline; it mostly selects for *unreflective* optimization dominated by whoever has power, which is precisely a specific kind of aiming. If this objection holds, the paper must replace its baseline distribution with an explicit model of default institutional selection under capability growth (power concentration, path dependence, coalition dynamics), rather than treating “no aiming at the best” as a neutral counterfactual.

6. "Self-Undermining Scale Insensitivity" attacks the inference “Scale-insensitivity (not expanding, or choosing wrong population size) could be a huge hidden moral catastrophe ⇒ common-sense utopia can lose most value without anyone noticing.” The paper uses our current scope-insensitivity as evidence that future people may also fail to care about scale, but later relies on the idea that advanced societies can do deep reflection and/or be guided by truth-seeking processes (and that these might steer toward eutopia). Yet scope sensitivity is one of the easiest moral ‘bugs’ for reflection to correct, because it is largely a consistency constraint plus factual awareness about astronomical stakes; it doesn’t require settling contentious metaethics. If reflection plausibly fixes scope insensitivity, then the scale-based catastrophe is not a robust dimension in the product model—it’s precisely the kind of thing that *washes out* with intelligence and deliberation, undermining the argument that many dimensions remain independently fragile even in advanced conditions. If this objection holds, the author must separate “fragile even under competent reflection” failure modes from “fragile only under current biases,” and show that enough of the former remain to sustain the narrow-target conclusion.

7. "The Governance Coupling Objection" attacks the inference “There are many disparate moral hazards (digital beings, wellbeing theory, space allocation, banned goods, etc.) ⇒ doing badly on any one can erase most value, because they are distinct contingent issues.” In practice, a small set of constitutional-level choices—rights expansion mechanisms, exit/voice structures, error-correction institutions, and constraints on coercive power—systematically control *how many* of these hazards can persist and at what scale. For example, a society with strong appeal processes for moral patients, reversible expansion policies, and competitive governance can correct mistaken bans, adjust digital personhood rules, and revise population policy without locking in. That means the hazard list is not “many independent darts to hit,” but “a few levers that create corrigibility,” making the target potentially much larger: you don’t need the right first-order answers, you need the right second-order institutions. If this objection holds, the paper must show that even highly corrigible governance still leaves a narrow eutopian target (e.g., because corrigibility itself is unstable, exploitable, or value-corrosive), rather than inferring narrowness from a grab-bag of first-order disagreements.

8. "The Pro-Extinction Boomerang" attacks the inference “Most plausible easygoing bounded views have major issues (scale-tipping, dominance violations, pro-extinction tendencies) ⇒ easygoingness is unlikely, so we should accept fussiness.” The paper’s own argument repeatedly generates decision-theoretic pathologies (dominance violations, fanaticism, and pro-extinction under downside tails) and then uses those pathologies to discredit the *easygoing* slice, leaving fussier views as the remaining ‘plausible’ set. But those same pathologies arguably indict the *entire* framework of treating ‘flourishing’ as a single cardinal vNM value function over world-histories under deep moral uncertainty, especially when combined with cosmic-scale tails; the result is that “fussy” may be not a moral truth but a symptom of the modeling choice. The boomerang is that if your analysis implies that the least-fussy plausible views are systematically extinction-favoring, the more natural diagnosis is that your intertheoretic aggregation and normalization machinery is mis-specified—not that reality makes eutopia intrinsically hard. If this objection holds, the author must either defend why the vNM-cardinalization plus the chosen comparability assumptions are non-negotiable, or reframe “no easy eutopia” in a way that does not rely on machinery that predictably produces dominance and extinction paradoxes at scale.

9. "The Adversarial Moral Patient Attack" attacks the inference “Digital-being rights are a major axis where getting it wrong could lose most value ⇒ this increases eutopian fragility, because policies could be morally catastrophic either way.” The paper treats digital welfare mainly as a moral uncertainty minefield, but it misses a central adversarial dynamic: once digital personhood has any political or moral weight, actors can strategically manufacture ‘moral patients’ (or convincing simulacra) to capture resources, votes, or legal protections—turning compassion into an attack surface. That creates a new, load-bearing tradeoff the paper doesn’t integrate: institutions robust against “fake patient inflation” may require harsh verification and denial procedures that themselves risk massive moral error if real patients are excluded. This makes the “give rights / don’t give rights” framing inadequate; the actual crux is robustness to adversarial creation and manipulation of minds at scale, which could force systematic injustice in either direction even under good intentions. If this objection holds, the paper must incorporate adversarial economics of moral status into its baseline (and show how a mostly-great future is achievable despite it), or else the digital-being discussion is not evidence of many independent moral dimensions but of one dominant security-style bottleneck.

10. "The Hidden ‘Feasible’ Assumption" attacks the inference “Eutopia is near the 99.99th percentile of feasible futures ⇒ comparing typical futures to that benchmark shows huge ‘lost value,’ so mostly-great outcomes are rare.” The paper quietly assumes that “best feasible” is feasible under the same physical, computational, and coordination constraints that also apply to the futures in the baseline distribution—yet many of its motivating extremes (galaxy-scale expansion, ultra-efficient bliss states, acausal trade, avoiding any bads across 10^22 systems) may require levels of coordination, control, and verification that are themselves incompatible with liberal, diverse, non-totalitarian societies. If the true Pareto frontier has a hard tradeoff between “value-maximizing tight control” and “robust freedom/corrigibility,” then the best-feasible anchor is not merely hard to hit; it’s in tension with the very properties the paper’s common-sense utopia treats as part of value. That would collapse the paper’s central conclusion into an artifact of benchmarking against an internally inconsistent ideal (maximal value *and* broad freedoms *and* near-zero bads at cosmic scale). If this objection holds, the author must redefine “best feasible” with explicit compatibility constraints (e.g., requiring non-totalitarian governance and epistemic humility) and then reassess whether “mostly-great” remains a narrow target under that constrained optimum.
