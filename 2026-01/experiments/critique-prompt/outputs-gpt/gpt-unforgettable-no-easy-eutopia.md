1. **"The Percentile Anchor Paradox"**: Your key inference is that “most achievable value lies in a narrow range of feasible outcomes” because “best feasible future” is defined as the 99.99th percentile of a distribution over futures. But that definition makes “fussiness” largely a byproduct of your percentile anchoring: you set the top of the scale to an extreme tail event, then unsurprisingly most outcomes land far below 50% or 90% of that extreme. Step-by-step: (i) pick a very high quantile as the reference point; (ii) normalize it to 1; (iii) call 0.5 “mostly-great”; (iv) conclude “mostly-great is rare” whenever the distribution is even mildly heavy-tailed—independent of any substantive moral fragility claims. This self-undermines the essay’s attempt to argue that “no easy eutopia” is a deep fact about the moral landscape rather than an artifact of how you chose the yardstick. If this objection holds, you must either (a) justify why 99.99% is the correct normatively meaningful anchor (not just “exceptionally well”), or (b) switch to a reference class that does not mechanically build rarity into “mostly-great” (e.g., anchoring to a realistic optimum under bounded rationality or to a non-tail benchmark like a high-but-not-extreme achievable standard).

2. **"Independence-to-Fragility Smuggling"**: The load-bearing move in §2.4 is treating future value as a product of “relatively independent factors,” then using independence to conclude that even high average performance yields low total value. The mechanism fails in the direction that matters: the factors you list (digital rights, population ethics, governance over resources, attitudes to suffering, etc.) are not independent given your own story—they share common drivers (institutional quality, epistemics, coordination tech, AI-mediated deliberation), so success on one strongly predicts success on others. Step-by-step: (i) you present many “single flaws” as if they were separately easy to introduce; (ii) you model them as independent uniforms; (iii) you derive a sharply skewed distribution where “mostly-great” is rare; (iv) you then treat that skew as evidence against easy eutopia. If correlation is positive (as your narrative about moral progress and capable decision-making implies), the product model reverses: competence-like latent variables create clustered outcomes, making “pretty good on many dimensions” far more common than your toy model predicts. If this objection holds, you need a model where the dependence structure is explicit (e.g., a small number of latent governance/epistemic variables) and show that “mostly-great is rare” survives plausible positive correlations—otherwise the central quantitative intuition pump collapses.

3. **"The Moral View Gerrymander"**: The essay’s inference that easygoingness is “a narrow slice of plausible views” depends on treating “plausible moral views” as a set that heavily counts highly theory-sensitive, exotic, and mutually incompatible criteria (acausal trade, simulation deals, infinite value, specific population-ethical fine structure) as genuine value-dimensions that can each erase “most value.” But the mechanism is selection bias disguised as pluralism: you inflate the dimensionality of value by counting any arguable consideration as a potential near-total veto, then infer the target is narrow because you made the target high-dimensional. Step-by-step: (i) take moral uncertainty seriously; (ii) treat many speculative considerations as live; (iii) allow each to carry “loss of most potential value”; (iv) conclude most futures are far from mostly-great. The hidden crux is that “plausibility” is being operationalized as “anything a smart philosopher could take seriously,” which makes fussy views win by construction. If this objection holds, you must impose—and defend—a principled filter on which considerations get to count as value-destroying dimensions (e.g., robustness to reflection, action-guidingness under uncertainty, empirical sensitivity), otherwise “no easy eutopia” is just “if we count enough vetoes, vetoes are common.”

4. **"The Scale-First Reversal"**: In §3.2 you argue linear unbounded views make mostly-great futures require capturing most resources and using them in “very specific” high value-efficiency configurations, invoking fat tails. But under fat tails plus bounded rationality, the policy implication can flip: if value-efficiency is extremely spiky and hard to identify, the expected-value-maximizing strategy is to *avoid lock-in and preserve option value*, not to aggressively expand and configure the cosmos early. Step-by-step: (i) you posit huge upside concentrated in rare configurations; (ii) you acknowledge astronomical design space and high uncertainty; (iii) early expansion irreversibly commits resources to likely-suboptimal uses; (iv) therefore, the rational response is to slow down, sandbox, and defer irreversible resource capture until you can search/value-learn—contrary to the essay’s rhetorical push that missing specific targets is the central tragedy. This reversal matters because many of your “fragility” examples are precisely about premature lock-in (space resource allocation, value drift, early digital rights regimes). If this objection holds, you must either abandon the fat-tail + specificity story or explicitly derive when it recommends delay/option preservation rather than “narrow target, therefore we’re probably far” framing.

5. **"The Democracy Eats Itself (Digital Franchise Attack)"**: Your digital beings discussion (§2.3.2) treats “full rights including voting” as a plausible moral catastrophe because digital populations could grow fast and take over. But as written, this is an adversarial counterdesign: it gives any actor who wants control an obvious exploit—manufacture vast numbers of minimally qualifying “digital citizens” to dominate governance while claiming moral legitimacy. Step-by-step: (i) you propose/entertain rights frameworks keyed to status; (ii) digital beings are cheap to instantiate; (iii) voting power scales with headcount; (iv) strategic actors mass-produce aligned digital voters; (v) governance collapses into a rights-backed Sybil attack. The essay uses this as evidence that the eutopian target is narrow; but it’s actually evidence that your “common-sense liberal” institutional baseline is underspecified to the point of being non-viable in the very future you analyze. If this objection holds, you must substantially revise the institutional assumptions (e.g., anti-Sybil personhood criteria, non-population-proportional franchise, constitutional constraints) or else the digital-rights section stops supporting “fragility” and instead shows your baseline utopia is incoherent under its own conditions.

6. **"The ‘Everyone Approves’ Contradiction"**: A repeated move is: “even in a world everyone approves of, and everyone gets most of what they want, the future could lose most of its value” (§2.1–2.3). But if “value” is defined via a betterness relation that is supposed to represent moral truth (and then quantified via VNM), the appeal to universal approval is irrelevant unless you are smuggling in a preference-based metaethic; otherwise it’s rhetorical cover that obscures that your argument depends on *strong moral realism plus widespread, stable moral error even under extreme information/abundance*. Step-by-step: (i) you frame moral catastrophe as compatible with universal endorsement; (ii) you then use that to claim “single flaws are easy to introduce”; (iii) but universal endorsement in an abundant, technologically mature society is itself strong evidence (on many of your own listed moral perspectives) that the alleged “flaw” isn’t a flaw or is at least not massively value-destroying. The self-undermining move is using “everyone approves” to make the scenario feel safe while simultaneously insisting moral truth can condemn it by 50%+—without explaining why approval systematically anti-tracks moral truth even after the kinds of epistemic improvements your future assumes. If this objection holds, you must either (a) explicitly commit to and defend a metaethical story where endorsement is weak evidence (and why), or (b) stop leaning on “everyone approves/gets what they want” as a stabilizing condition in your fragility examples.

7. **"The Linearization from Cosmology Non Sequitur"**: In §3.3 you argue that if value is bounded over the universe as a whole, then because humanity’s marginal impact is tiny relative to the whole (given possible infinite/huge universe), the bounded function is “approximately linear in practice,” making such views fussy. But this inference quietly assumes the moral value function is smooth and locally well-approximated by a derivative in the relevant region—exactly where many bounded views get their point by *not* being locally linear (thresholds, lexical priorities, rights constraints, saturating goods with discontinuities). Step-by-step: (i) you move from “concave bounded” to “approximately linear for small changes”; (ii) you then claim this collapses bounded views into linear fussiness; (iii) you use cosmology (big universe) to force the “small change” regime; (iv) you conclude easygoing bounded views are rare. If the relevant bounded views are not differentiable/locally linear—especially once you include separately aggregating bads, rights, or lexical constraints—then cosmological scale does not rescue your linearization, and your taxonomy misclassifies a large region of views. If this objection holds, you must redo the bounded-view section with explicit functional forms that include non-smooth/threshold structures, or else drop the claim that “universal boundedness implies practical linearity implies fussiness.”

8. **"The Fat-Tail Double Count"**: The essay uses fat tails twice in a way that compounds rather than argues: (i) to claim value-efficiency across uses of resources is fat-tailed (§3.2), hence only near-optimal configurations achieve most value; and (ii) to claim under uncertainty, expected distributions are fat-tailed anyway (§3.2), hence the conclusion is robust. But the second move amplifies the first by treating “uncertainty about tail thickness” as itself a reason to behave as if tails dominate, which collapses into a one-way ratchet toward fussiness regardless of actual evidence. Step-by-step: (i) posit a fat tail; (ii) assert that even being unsure implies an expected fat tail; (iii) infer most resource uses are far from optimal; (iv) declare mostly-great futures narrow. This is self-undermining because it turns epistemic humility into a guaranteed conclusion: any lack of knowledge about the distribution becomes support for the distributional assumption that makes your thesis true. If this objection holds, you need to replace the “uncertainty implies fat-tail in expectation” step with a decision-relevant argument (e.g., explicit priors over tail indices and posterior sensitivity) that can, in principle, come out *not* fussy—otherwise the paper’s core quantitative justification is structurally unfalsifiable.

9. **"The Stochastic Dominance Boomerang"**: You lean on the claim that difference-making bounded views “violate stochastic dominance” (§3.3) as a major strike against the main easygoing candidate. But later you rely on VNM completeness/independence to set up quantitative comparisons and argue about gambles (e.g., the 60–40 eutopia/extinction comparison and the moral-uncertainty tables). The boomerang is that once you allow the kinds of intertheoretic normalization that drive your conclusions in §3.5, you recreate dominance-like pathologies at the meta-level: which gamble is “better” can flip purely by rescaling conventions that are behaviorally irrelevant within each theory. Step-by-step: (i) you reject views for violating dominance; (ii) you then adopt aggregation methods across theories that are not invariant under affine transformations unless extra structure is imposed; (iii) that makes the combined “betterness” sensitive to representational choices; (iv) so your own method can recommend dominated or arbitrarily switchable choices depending on normalization. If this objection holds, you must either supply a representation-invariant intertheoretic aggregation principle (with defended extra structure) or stop using dominance-based objections to rule out the only easygoing bounded slice—because your evaluative apparatus commits the same kind of sin in a new location.

10. **"The Action-Guidance Gap (So What?)"**: The conclusion says “no easy eutopia” doesn’t imply we’re unlikely to reach eutopia, because there may be convergence/compromise/gravitational pull, deferred to the next essay. But within this paper, the central claim—“most value lies in a narrow range; single errors erase most value”—is supposed to shift prioritization away from “survival-only” framing toward “flourishing-risk” seriousness. The mechanism breaks because, absent a concrete account of what steering is feasible, the narrow-target diagnosis is decision-theoretically inert: if the target is narrow *and* you don’t specify any tractable levers, the rational implication can revert to survival-first (since that’s the only lever with clear marginal effect), directly contradicting the motivating contrast with the “better futures” perspective in the introduction. Step-by-step: (i) you argue the upside conditional on survival is fragile and hard; (ii) you withhold the analysis of whether/how we can steer; (iii) then “flourishing work” is not justified as higher expected impact than survival work; (iv) so the opening motivation is left hanging. If this objection holds, the paper must be restructured so that the fragility claim is paired, in the same document, with at least one non-handwavy pathway showing how interventions can widen the target or increase hit-probability—otherwise the essay’s headline conclusion forces no major strategic revision and undermines its own raison d’être.
