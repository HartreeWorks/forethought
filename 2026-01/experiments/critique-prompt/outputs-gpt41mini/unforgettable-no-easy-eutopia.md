1. "Fragile Island Assumption" attacks the central inference that the near-best future (eutopia) is a narrow island difficult to hit because its value is the product of many independent factors. This assumes that these factors are largely independent and multiplicative. However, if there exist strong, positive dependencies or systemic feedback loops—such as moral progress driving technological progress or vice versa—then success in one factor can substantially increase the probability of succeeding in others. The paper’s argument would then overstate the fragility of eutopia. If this objection holds, the paper must incorporate models of factor interdependence and feedback, potentially enlarging the effective size and accessibility of the eutopian target.

2. "Eutopia in Plain Sight" challenges the premise that a future where everyone is free, happy, and materially abundant necessarily requires hitting a narrow and delicate target, by pointing out that the paper underestimates how inclusive many moral views are of “common-sense utopia” as mostly-great. Given the vast diversity of plausible moral perspectives described, many would place common-sense utopia above the 50% value threshold without demanding perfection along every axis. This implies the eutopia target may be much broader and easier to reach than argued, especially if future societies evolve toward tolerance or pluralism. Addressing this would require the paper to explain why the aggregate moral uncertainty wouldn’t favor such relatively easygoing, pluralistic conceptions.

3. "Moral Catastrophe Overload" weakens the inference that single moral errors compound multiplicatively to make eutopia rare, by suggesting that future governance and technology might allow localized moral catastrophes to be quarantined or reversed without collapsing the entire value of the future. The paper treats moral catastrophes as fully independent and globally fatal factors, but if future societies develop powerful corrective mechanisms (e.g., moral AI advisors, decentralized governance, patterns of rebellion and reform), the overall value product may be more robust to isolated flaws. If correct, this challenges the assumed multiplicative fragility and implies that eutopian futures might be more resilient, calling for models including error correction dynamics.

4. "The Navigation Paradox" targets the analogy that good navigation and multiple attempts (Section 1) are independent of the target size. The paper argues only the target size matters in this essay, but uncertainties in navigation skill or attempts could interact with fragility, muddying conclusions. If future societies can systematically improve navigation over time or intensify attempts toward eutopia despite narrowness, the difficulty posed by a small target size may be less critical. The paper’s isolating point (1) neglects these dynamic interactions, so if this objection holds, a full evaluation needs integrating navigation and attempts into the difficulty assessment.

5. "Asymmetric Scale Sensitivities" attacks the paper’s treatment of population ethics and scale measures, particularly where it assumes future value scales linearly or near-linearly with population size or resource use. Some plausible moral views valued by the paper (e.g., critical-level theories) might produce non-linear or threshold effects where adding more beings does not increase or may even decrease overall value significantly. If these views dominate or are more accurate, the paper’s claim about widespread scale-sensitivity translating to narrow eutopia targets demands revision. The paper would need to analyze specific scale effects under alternative population ethics to properly calibrate fussiness.

6. "Digital Being Voting Wheel" undermines the inference that society’s political decisions about digital beings will narrow the eutopia target by locking in wrong moral views or power structures. The paper assumes such dynamics are likely to cause moral catastrophe. But if society designs robust digital governance with well-calibrated protections, transparent mechanisms, and failsafes—e.g., constitutional AI safeguards or checks on digital voting influence—then digital governance errors could be minimized. This weakens the claim that these issues make eutopia extremely narrow or fragile. To respond, the paper must incorporate the possibility and impact of durable political institutions reducing digital moral catastrophe risk.

7. "Bias in Wellbeing Models" attacks the argument that diverging conceptions of wellbeing in future advanced societies increase moral error risk and eutopia fragility. The paper assumes future agents will systematically favor sufficiently narrowly defined wellbeing concepts to cause catastrophes (e.g., bliss without autonomy). However, it neglects potential epistemic humility, pluralism, and adaptive adjustment in wellbeing theories driven by living experience and societal feedback. If future societies self-correct or blend wellbeing theories pragmatically, this might make eutopia less fussy. The paper would have to model learning and adaptation in future wellbeing conceptions to account for this.

8. "Resource Allocation Ambiguity" targets the inference that early space resource settlement will rigidly lock in morally catastrophic allocations. The paper assumes zero-sum, permanent allocation decisions that greatly limit moral diversity or produce concentrated control. But if resource allocation institutional solutions emerge that support dynamic, reversible, and equitable sharing (e.g., space resource commons, federated governance), the risk of catastrophic permanent mistakes falls. This challenge means the narrowness of eutopian targets is conditional on very pessimistic political assumptions. To hold, the paper must confront institution-building possibilities that enable substantial recovery or mitigation.

9. "Moral Uncertainty Aggregation Blindspot" confronts the paper’s treatment of moral uncertainty aggregation strategies, which strictly fix scaling between views on extinction and best feasible futures. By showing that other normalizations or pairwise comparative approaches dramatically affect rankings of safety- versus upside-focused options, the paper’s claim that “easygoingness is unlikely” and fussy views dominate depends heavily on arbitrary aggregation conventions. If more normatively justified aggregation rules weaken the dominance of fussy views or support upside-seeking, the conclusion about eutopia’s narrowness hinges on unresolved metaethical choices. The paper must then recognize and address this ambiguity instead of concluding easygoingness is unlikely.

10. "Scale-Tipping Instability" attacks bounded joint aggregation views’ inference that tiny changes in good/bad balance can cause abrupt value leaps between extinction and eutopia. The paper treats this instability as a strike against those views’ plausibility and easygoingness. However, it fails to consider that humans routinely handle abrupt tipping points in other domains (e.g., chaos theory, critical transitions) via robustness heuristics or smoothing mechanisms. If bounded views can incorporate smoothing or layered value functions that damp scale-tipping, then such views might avoid the paper’s objection and remain plausible easygoing candidates. Addressing this would require the paper to analyze how smoothing or meta-level value aggregation can stabilize value functions.
