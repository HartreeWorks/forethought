1. The claim that eutopian futures are rare because the value of the future is multiplicative across many independent factors (Section 2.4) is vulnerable to a countermodel attack: if there exist strong dependencies or complementarities between factors such that success on some key dimensions automatically improves others, then the multiplicative fragility argument would collapse and a broader target for mostly-great futures would emerge. If this critique holds, the paper’s core conclusion about the difficulty of achieving eutopia would be significantly weakened.

2. The assertion that linear unbounded moral views require almost all resources to be used for very specific purposes to reach a mostly-great future (Section 3.2) is open to parameter sensitivity critique: the paper treats the distribution of value-efficiency as fixed and fat-tailed, but if the shape or tail heaviness of this distribution varies with new scientific or technological paradigms, then the fussiness of these views can be less severe or change over time. If this critique holds, the argument that linear views are necessarily fussy would be less robust.

3. The argument that the future is easily undermined by single moral errors across many domains (Section 2.3 and 2.4) faces an equilibrium shift critique: strategic actors in future societies may develop robust institutions, norms, or technologies precisely designed to detect and correct such moral errors, thus undermining the fragility premise. If this holds, the claim that mostly-great futures form a narrow target dependent on multifactor success becomes less compelling.

4. The discussion of bounded views aggregating goods and bads separately leading to fussiness because any small quantity of bads can undermine a mostly-great future (Section 3.3) suffers a reference class failure: this modeling treats moral goods and bads as fully separable in a large-scale outcome space, but many moral theories emphasize context and goal-relative tradeoffs that do not fit this simplistic aggregation. If correct, this weakens the paper’s case that bounded views must be fussy in this problematic way.

5. The claim (Section 3.3) that bounded views which aggregate goods and bads jointly are implausible and lead to scale-tipping problems is vulnerable to a quantitative cliff critique: these views might behave well within certain reasonable scales (e.g., planetary or galactic) and only exhibit scale-tipping behaviors beyond practically attainable limits. If so, joint aggregation bounded views could be easier than argued to accept, challenging the paper’s dismissal of their plausibility.

6. The conclusion that easygoingness about achieving mostly-great futures is unlikely because most plausible moral views are fussy (Section 3.4) is subject to causal reversal: one might argue that the very fussiness and narrowness of targets provoke institutional and social adaptations aimed at convergence and compromise, making mostly-great futures not only more likely but self-reinforcing. This reverses the intended inference, suggesting fussiness might paradoxically increase the chance of eutopia.

7. The modeling of expected value via a uniform distribution of independent factors between 0 and 1 in Section 2.4 is vulnerable to parameter sensitivity: treating all factors as independent and uniformly distributed ignores correlated improvements or failures, as well as non-uniform risk profiles, which can dramatically alter the distribution and expected value of futures. This undermines the robustness of the multiplicative model and its far-reaching conclusions about rarity.

8. The handling of moral uncertainty and intertheoretic value aggregation (Section 3.5) is open to a countermodel attack: if views with different value scale normalizations cannot be meaningfully averaged or compared, then the attempt to aggregate across morally uncertain frameworks using weighted means or normalizations collapses, implying that the relative fussiness or easygoingness of the combined uncertainty-weighted view is undetermined. This undermines claims about aggregate decision-making under moral uncertainty.

9. The assumption that future digital beings will be treated either as owned tools or granted full rights leading to moral catastrophe scenarios (Section 2.3.2) faces an equilibrium shift critique: future political and social systems might evolve adaptive governance mechanisms that balance digital being rights dynamically, avoiding extreme moral failures on either extreme and enabling significantly valuable futures. If so, the presumption of moral catastrophe in this domain weakens.

10. The analogy of reaching eutopia to a sailing expedition to an island (Introduction) exhibits reference class failure: the metaphor assumes a fixed, static target and navigation conditions, but the future involves evolving values, feedback loops, emergent properties, and complex interdependencies not captured by static geographic analogies. If this critique holds, the explanatory power of the metaphor—and by extension the paper’s framing—diminishes, calling for more nuanced models of moral and social progress.
