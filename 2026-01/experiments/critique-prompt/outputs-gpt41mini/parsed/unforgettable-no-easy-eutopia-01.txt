"Fragile Island Assumption" attacks the central inference that the near-best future (eutopia) is a narrow island difficult to hit because its value is the product of many independent factors. This assumes that these factors are largely independent and multiplicative. However, if there exist strong, positive dependencies or systemic feedback loops—such as moral progress driving technological progress or vice versa—then success in one factor can substantially increase the probability of succeeding in others. The paper’s argument would then overstate the fragility of eutopia. If this objection holds, the paper must incorporate models of factor interdependence and feedback, potentially enlarging the effective size and accessibility of the eutopian target.
