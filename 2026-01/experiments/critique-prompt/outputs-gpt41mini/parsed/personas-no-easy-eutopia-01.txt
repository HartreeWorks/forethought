[The Empirical Hardliner] The paper claims that the value of the future can be modeled as a multiplicative product of many relatively independent factors (Section 2.4), leading to “eutopian fragility.” However, this claim lacks identification of specific causal mechanisms that ensure factor independence or uniform distributions, and it offers no falsifiable predictions. Without empirical evidence or a formal causal framework, this multiplicative model could be an oversimplified statistical artifact rather than a real structural property of moral value dynamics. Consequently, if the independence assumption fails, the paper’s quantitative conclusions about narrow “mostly-great” futures lose all empirical grounding, rendering its core argument speculative and unfalsifiable.
