"Eutopia in Plain Sight" challenges the premise that a future where everyone is free, happy, and materially abundant necessarily requires hitting a narrow and delicate target, by pointing out that the paper underestimates how inclusive many moral views are of “common-sense utopia” as mostly-great. Given the vast diversity of plausible moral perspectives described, many would place common-sense utopia above the 50% value threshold without demanding perfection along every axis. This implies the eutopia target may be much broader and easier to reach than argued, especially if future societies evolve toward tolerance or pluralism. Addressing this would require the paper to explain why the aggregate moral uncertainty wouldn’t favor such relatively easygoing, pluralistic conceptions.
