"Resource Allocation Ambiguity" targets the inference that early space resource settlement will rigidly lock in morally catastrophic allocations. The paper assumes zero-sum, permanent allocation decisions that greatly limit moral diversity or produce concentrated control. But if resource allocation institutional solutions emerge that support dynamic, reversible, and equitable sharing (e.g., space resource commons, federated governance), the risk of catastrophic permanent mistakes falls. This challenge means the narrowness of eutopian targets is conditional on very pessimistic political assumptions. To hold, the paper must confront institution-building possibilities that enable substantial recovery or mitigation.
