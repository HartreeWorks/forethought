"Moral Uncertainty Aggregation Blindspot" confronts the paper’s treatment of moral uncertainty aggregation strategies, which strictly fix scaling between views on extinction and best feasible futures. By showing that other normalizations or pairwise comparative approaches dramatically affect rankings of safety- versus upside-focused options, the paper’s claim that “easygoingness is unlikely” and fussy views dominate depends heavily on arbitrary aggregation conventions. If more normatively justified aggregation rules weaken the dominance of fussy views or support upside-seeking, the conclusion about eutopia’s narrowness hinges on unresolved metaethical choices. The paper must then recognize and address this ambiguity instead of concluding easygoingness is unlikely.
