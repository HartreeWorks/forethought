"Asymmetric Scale Sensitivities" attacks the paper’s treatment of population ethics and scale measures, particularly where it assumes future value scales linearly or near-linearly with population size or resource use. Some plausible moral views valued by the paper (e.g., critical-level theories) might produce non-linear or threshold effects where adding more beings does not increase or may even decrease overall value significantly. If these views dominate or are more accurate, the paper’s claim about widespread scale-sensitivity translating to narrow eutopia targets demands revision. The paper would need to analyze specific scale effects under alternative population ethics to properly calibrate fussiness.
