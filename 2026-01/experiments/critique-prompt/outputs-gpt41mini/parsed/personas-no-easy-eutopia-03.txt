[The Mechanism Designer] Throughout Sections 2 and 3, the paper relies heavily on qualitative moral reasoning and informal probabilistic statements (e.g., “value-efficiency distributions are fat-tailed”). Without formalizing these claims into explicit mathematical or computational models—i.e., no formal specifications, code, or algorithms—the arguments remain unverifiable and non-reproducible. This lack of formal rigor means we cannot systematically explore failure modes, counterexamples, or boundary cases. Consequently, the paper’s claims about “fussiness” and narrow targets are impressionistic and thus unable to serve as a foundation for mechanism design or robust policy interventions aiming to actually steer future outcomes.
