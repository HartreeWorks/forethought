[The Moral Parliament Dissenter] The paper’s framing of value aggregation (Section 3) assumes the existence of a single, consistent betterness relation and uses cardinal expected utility axioms that implicitly privilege consequentialist aggregation of goods and bads. This excludes pluralist, incommensurable, or kantian value frameworks that reject full comparability and numerical aggregation. Because many credible moral systems resist these assumptions, all conclusions about “fussy” versus “easygoing” views rely on a biased ethical framework that marginalizes legitimate dissent. Thus, the paper fails to anticipate objections from essential complexity in ethical value pluralism.
