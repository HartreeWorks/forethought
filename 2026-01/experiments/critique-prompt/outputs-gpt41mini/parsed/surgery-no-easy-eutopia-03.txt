The argument that the future is easily undermined by single moral errors across many domains (Section 2.3 and 2.4) faces an equilibrium shift critique: strategic actors in future societies may develop robust institutions, norms, or technologies precisely designed to detect and correct such moral errors, thus undermining the fragility premise. If this holds, the claim that mostly-great futures form a narrow target dependent on multifactor success becomes less compelling.
