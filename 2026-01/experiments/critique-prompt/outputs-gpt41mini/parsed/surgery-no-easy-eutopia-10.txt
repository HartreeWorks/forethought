The analogy of reaching eutopia to a sailing expedition to an island (Introduction) exhibits reference class failure: the metaphor assumes a fixed, static target and navigation conditions, but the future involves evolving values, feedback loops, emergent properties, and complex interdependencies not captured by static geographic analogies. If this critique holds, the explanatory power of the metaphor—and by extension the paper’s framing—diminishes, calling for more nuanced models of moral and social progress.
