"Bias in Wellbeing Models" attacks the argument that diverging conceptions of wellbeing in future advanced societies increase moral error risk and eutopia fragility. The paper assumes future agents will systematically favor sufficiently narrowly defined wellbeing concepts to cause catastrophes (e.g., bliss without autonomy). However, it neglects potential epistemic humility, pluralism, and adaptive adjustment in wellbeing theories driven by living experience and societal feedback. If future societies self-correct or blend wellbeing theories pragmatically, this might make eutopia less fussy. The paper would have to model learning and adaptation in future wellbeing conceptions to account for this.
