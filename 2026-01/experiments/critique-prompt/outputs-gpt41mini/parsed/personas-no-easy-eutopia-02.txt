[The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper assumes that society can (or must) coordinate to “aim” at the narrow eutopian target, but neglects incentive gradients that enable actors to deviate. In particular, the discussion of digital beings’ rights and resource allocation (Section 2.3.2 and 2.3.4) ignores how powerful actors will defect by hoarding resources or exploiting digital slaves to maximize short-term gain. This incentive-driven cheating will systematically shift outcomes away from the narrow “mostly-great” set toward more exploitative equilibria, undermining the paper’s implicit assumption that the narrow target can be stably reached. Thus, the fragility described might be less about moral complexity and more about unmanageable strategic incentives leading to persistent moral catastrophe.
