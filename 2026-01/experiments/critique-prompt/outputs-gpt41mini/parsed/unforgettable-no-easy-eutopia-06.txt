"Digital Being Voting Wheel" undermines the inference that society’s political decisions about digital beings will narrow the eutopia target by locking in wrong moral views or power structures. The paper assumes such dynamics are likely to cause moral catastrophe. But if society designs robust digital governance with well-calibrated protections, transparent mechanisms, and failsafes—e.g., constitutional AI safeguards or checks on digital voting influence—then digital governance errors could be minimized. This weakens the claim that these issues make eutopia extremely narrow or fragile. To respond, the paper must incorporate the possibility and impact of durable political institutions reducing digital moral catastrophe risk.
