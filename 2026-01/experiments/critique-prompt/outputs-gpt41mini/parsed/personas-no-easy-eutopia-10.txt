The paper models future value as a product of independent factors and analyzes boundedness of value functions assuming structured aggregation (Section 2.4 and Section 3), but it neglects the emergent, nonlinear interactions between social, technological, ecological, and moral factors. Complex adaptive systems theory shows that interactions can generate unforeseen feedback loops, tipping points, and path dependencies that invalidate multiplicative or linear assumptions. Consequently, the “fussy” target sets may not even be well-defined attractors in the complex system of the future, making the entire analytic framework overly simplistic and unable to capture true dynamics of value emergence or collapse.
