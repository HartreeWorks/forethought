> Strong dependencies between value dimensions—where getting some right pulls others along—would collapse the multiplicative fragility argument and make eutopia far less improbable.

The claim that eutopian futures are rare because the value of the future is multiplicative across many independent factors (Section 2.4) is vulnerable to a countermodel attack: if there exist strong dependencies or complementarities between factors such that success on some key dimensions automatically improves others, then the multiplicative fragility argument would collapse and a broader target for mostly-great futures would emerge. If this critique holds, the paper’s core conclusion about the difficulty of achieving eutopia would be significantly weakened.
