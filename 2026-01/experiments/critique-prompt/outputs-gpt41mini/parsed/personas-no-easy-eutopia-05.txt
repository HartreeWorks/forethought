[The Capability Accelerationist] The paper accepts the premise that social and technological progress could enable reaching eutopia but ignores how arbitrary safety or moral “checks” that slow capability growth only serve to redistribute who reaches advanced futures first. In Section 2.3.4, the discussion of star system colonization misses that attempts to moralize early resource grabs will cause races and arms races accelerating expansion without ethical safeguards. Since capabilities are treated as exogenous and safety as an add-on, the paper’s inference that moral catastrophes can be avoided by aiming better is flawed; instead, accelerating actors will jump ahead, leading to worse outcomes regardless of moral “fussiness.”
