The paper assumes that future societies could converge on correct moral views or engage in rational deliberation to hit the eutopian target (Section 4), but this neglects pervasive principal-agent problems and regulatory capture. Political and social institutions are prone to compliance theater, entrench self-interested elites, and resist genuinely transformative change. Hence, even if ideal moral views exist, institutions will likely subvert or hollow them out, ensuring persistent moral catastrophe. The result is that the “no easy eutopia” view underestimates the extent to which institutional pathologies systematically prevent the narrow target from ever being reached, rendering the essay’s optimism about convergence naïve.
