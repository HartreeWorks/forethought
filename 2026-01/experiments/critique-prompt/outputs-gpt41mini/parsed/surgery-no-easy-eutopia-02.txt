The assertion that linear unbounded moral views require almost all resources to be used for very specific purposes to reach a mostly-great future (Section 3.2) is open to parameter sensitivity critique: the paper treats the distribution of value-efficiency as fixed and fat-tailed, but if the shape or tail heaviness of this distribution varies with new scientific or technological paradigms, then the fussiness of these views can be less severe or change over time. If this critique holds, the argument that linear views are necessarily fussy would be less robust.
