"The Navigation Paradox" targets the analogy that good navigation and multiple attempts (Section 1) are independent of the target size. The paper argues only the target size matters in this essay, but uncertainties in navigation skill or attempts could interact with fragility, muddying conclusions. If future societies can systematically improve navigation over time or intensify attempts toward eutopia despite narrowness, the difficulty posed by a small target size may be less critical. The paper’s isolating point (1) neglects these dynamic interactions, so if this objection holds, a full evaluation needs integrating navigation and attempts into the difficulty assessment.
