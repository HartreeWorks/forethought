The argument that a mostly-great future requires near-perfect moral decisions across many dimensions (2.4–2.5) overlooks the inevitability that sophisticated adversaries—whether malicious AIs, state actors, or ideological minorities—will exploit any moral or institutional gap. These adversaries will intentionally inject moral error or sabotage consensus to gain advantage, making the eutopian target not just narrow but actively targeted for disruption. Hence, the paper’s narrow target is not merely hard to hit by accident, but infeasible under persistent adversarial attack, threatening failure modes unseen by the authors.
