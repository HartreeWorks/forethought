"Scale-Tipping Instability" attacks bounded joint aggregation views’ inference that tiny changes in good/bad balance can cause abrupt value leaps between extinction and eutopia. The paper treats this instability as a strike against those views’ plausibility and easygoingness. However, it fails to consider that humans routinely handle abrupt tipping points in other domains (e.g., chaos theory, critical transitions) via robustness heuristics or smoothing mechanisms. If bounded views can incorporate smoothing or layered value functions that damp scale-tipping, then such views might avoid the paper’s objection and remain plausible easygoing candidates. Addressing this would require the paper to analyze how smoothing or meta-level value aggregation can stabilize value functions.
