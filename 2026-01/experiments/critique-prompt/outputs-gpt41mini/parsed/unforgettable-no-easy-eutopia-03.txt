"Moral Catastrophe Overload" weakens the inference that single moral errors compound multiplicatively to make eutopia rare, by suggesting that future governance and technology might allow localized moral catastrophes to be quarantined or reversed without collapsing the entire value of the future. The paper treats moral catastrophes as fully independent and globally fatal factors, but if future societies develop powerful corrective mechanisms (e.g., moral AI advisors, decentralized governance, patterns of rebellion and reform), the overall value product may be more robust to isolated flaws. If correct, this challenges the assumed multiplicative fragility and implies that eutopian futures might be more resilient, calling for models including error correction dynamics.
