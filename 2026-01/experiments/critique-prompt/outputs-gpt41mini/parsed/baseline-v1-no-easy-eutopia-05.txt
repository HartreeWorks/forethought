The paper treats moral catastrophe as a broad and somewhat static concept across history and possible futures, but it does not address the possibility that moral progress could be non-linear and self-corrective, nor does it engage deeply with literature on cultural evolution or feedback mechanisms that might make eutopian futures easier to reach than predicted.
