The claim (Section 3.3) that bounded views which aggregate goods and bads jointly are implausible and lead to scale-tipping problems is vulnerable to a quantitative cliff critique: these views might behave well within certain reasonable scales (e.g., planetary or galactic) and only exhibit scale-tipping behaviors beyond practically attainable limits. If so, joint aggregation bounded views could be easier than argued to accept, challenging the paper’s dismissal of their plausibility.
