The assumption that future digital beings will be treated either as owned tools or granted full rights leading to moral catastrophe scenarios (Section 2.3.2) faces an equilibrium shift critique: future political and social systems might evolve adaptive governance mechanisms that balance digital being rights dynamically, avoiding extreme moral failures on either extreme and enabling significantly valuable futures. If so, the presumption of moral catastrophe in this domain weakens.
