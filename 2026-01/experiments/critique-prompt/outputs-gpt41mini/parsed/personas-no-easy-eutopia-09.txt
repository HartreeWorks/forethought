[The Historical Parallelist] The paper’s optimism about potential convergence on correct moral views or stable compromise (Section 4) overlooks countless historical analogies where seemingly stable moral or political orders crumbled or ossified amid narrow ideals. For instance, religious schisms, revolutions, and regime collapses repeatedly invalidated claims of near-best moral orders. The historical record suggests that attempts to “aim” at a singular narrow moral future tend to provoke conflict, factionalism, or innovation instability, indicating the “no easy eutopia” is not just difficult but likely systematically unattainable due to recurring cycles of moral failure absent unprecedented institutional reinvention.
