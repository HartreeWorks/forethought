[The Second-Order Catastrophist] If the paper’s “no easy eutopia” proposal succeeds—society narrows its aim to avoid moral errors and hits the eutopian target—this will compress moral diversity and experimentation, potentially causing brittle social systems with fragile homogeneity. Such homogeneity may cause systemic vulnerabilities—from loss of genetic, cultural, or epistemic diversity—triggering catastrophic collapses if unforeseen shocks arise. Thus, the proposal’s success paradoxically elevates the risk of second-order catastrophes, undermining the assumed long-term gain from focusing narrowly on “mostly-great” futures.
