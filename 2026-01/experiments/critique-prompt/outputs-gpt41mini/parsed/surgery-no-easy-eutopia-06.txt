> Moral fussiness might actually be self-correcting—the narrower the target, the more pressure societies face to build institutions that converge on compromise, making eutopia more likely, not less.

The conclusion that easygoingness about achieving mostly-great futures is unlikely because most plausible moral views are fussy (Section 3.4) is subject to causal reversal: one might argue that the very fussiness and narrowness of targets provoke institutional and social adaptations aimed at convergence and compromise, making mostly-great futures not only more likely but self-reinforcing. This reverses the intended inference, suggesting fussiness might paradoxically increase the chance of eutopia.
