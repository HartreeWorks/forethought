1. The paper assumes that multiple moral flaws independently and multiplicatively reduce the overall value of the future, but it does not seriously consider alternative models of value aggregation (e.g., additive or non-independent interactions), which could significantly alter the conclusion about eutopian fragility and ease of achieving mostly-great futures.

2. The argument relies heavily on an idealized concept of “best feasible future” and “near-best future,” but it remains ambiguous how these are quantified in practice, leaving open questions about how sensitive the conclusions are to subjective or culturally relative conceptions of moral value and what standards to apply.

3. The treatment of moral uncertainty and intertheoretic comparisons in Section 3.5 adopts specific normalization methods and averaging procedures that seem somewhat arbitrary, yet the paper does not engage sufficiently with well-established philosophical critiques of intertheoretic value aggregation, potentially undermining the robustness of its conclusions about which options to prefer under uncertainty.

4. The extensive focus on population ethics and scale-sensitivity assumes that more beings or larger-scale futures are always morally relevant in the same way, yet the paper insufficiently addresses persistent counterarguments such as the “Repugnant Conclusion” or theories that assign intrinsic value to certain population sizes or qualities over mere numbers.

5. The paper treats moral catastrophe as a broad and somewhat static concept across history and possible futures, but it does not address the possibility that moral progress could be non-linear and self-corrective, nor does it engage deeply with literature on cultural evolution or feedback mechanisms that might make eutopian futures easier to reach than predicted.

6. The analogy comparing future value to sailing toward an island assumes that navigation and effort are conceptually separable from the size and nature of the target (eutopia), but this separation might be misleading because social, technological, and moral “navigation” could fundamentally change what counts as the target, affecting the argument’s scope and relevance.

7. The paper’s model assumes independence between factors reducing future value, yet it ignores how some factors might be correlated or causally linked, thereby overweighting the likelihood of multiplicative failure and possibly exaggerating eutopian fragility.

8. Some empirical claims, such as future digital beings potentially being treated like owned property or the speed and scale of interstellar colonization, are presented as premises without sufficient engagement with ongoing debates or uncertainties about technological feasibility, social norms, or political developments.

9. While the paper outlines a broad taxonomy of moral views (bounded, unbounded, linear, etc.), it fails to rigorously incorporate or address competing metaethical positions such as expressivism or moral particularism that may reject a cardinal utility representation or the completeness axiom, limiting the generalizability of its analysis.

10. The assumption that society could converge on “correct” moral views or compromise sufficiently to hit eutopia is mentioned only briefly and postponed to a subsequent essay, yet the current paper’s strong emphasis on the narrowness of achieving eutopia may be premature without integrating a developed account of social dynamics, political feasibility, or institutional design.
