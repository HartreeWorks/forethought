  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s reliance (especially in \u00a73\u2013\u00a73.5) on fairly stable utility/axiology \u201cshape\u201d distinctions (linear vs diminishing, bounded vs unbounded) when assessing whether bargaining/trade can yield mostly-great futures. If those descriptors become strategically endogenized under mind-copying and identity-engineering, that would be a real additional blocker to the optimism about trade/compromise and could exacerbate power-concentration/decision-procedure fragility\u2014so the attacked point is moderately central. However, the essay is mostly conditional and already emphasizes institutional dependence, timing effects (quasi-linear becoming linear after satiation), and blockers; it does not straightforwardly propose building protocols around inferred curvature, so the critique partially mis-aims at an extrapolated institutionalization rather than the essay\u2019s core conclusions. The scenario is conceptually plausible (preference manipulation via identity splits; dynamic inconsistency; legitimacy crises), but the predicted cascade (perpetual renegotiation \u2192 emergency decree) is speculative and not tightly argued. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little non-contributing material.",
