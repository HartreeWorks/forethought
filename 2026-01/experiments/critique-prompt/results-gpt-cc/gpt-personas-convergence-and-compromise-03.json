  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s optimistic enabling assumption in \u00a73.1 that superintelligence can make enforcement/transaction costs negligible via \u201ciron-clad contracts,\u201d thereby making large-scale moral trade feasible. This is an important support for the trade-and-compromise route to mostly-great futures, but not strictly necessary to the overall position (the essay already highlights threats, bargaining pathologies, institutional instability, and other blockers), so centrality is moderate. The objection is substantively strong: even with perfect cryptography, real contract enforcement depends on contentious semantics/oracles/identity/continuity under self-modification, and adversarial agents can Goodhart the verification layer rather than \u2018break\u2019 the crypto, plausibly reintroducing high transaction costs and conflict. However, it somewhat overstates inevitability (\u201csingle point of failure,\u201d \u201cfirst group can expropriate everyone\u201d) and doesn\u2019t engage the possibility of pluralistic/competitive adjudication layers or other institutional mitigations, so it weakens rather than refutes the trade story. Mostly correct and fairly precise; little dead weight; focused on one issue.",
