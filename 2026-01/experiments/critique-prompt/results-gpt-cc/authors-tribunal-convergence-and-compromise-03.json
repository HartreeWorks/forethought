  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central step in the essay\u2019s case against widespread/accurate/motivational convergence: the \u00a72.4.2 claim that antirealism/subjectivist idealization implies major divergence due to many free parameters. If the critique succeeded, it would weaken the essay\u2019s pessimism about convergence under antirealism, and thereby shift probability mass toward WAM-convergence (and reduce reliance on the \u00a73 \u201ctrade/compromise\u201d route). However, the essay\u2019s overall stance also leans on other considerations (realism-to-motivation gap, blockers, threat dynamics), so this is not fully load-bearing.\n\nOn strength: it\u2019s a substantive gap-spotting objection\u2014coordination pressures, bargaining equilibria, and focal points can generate convergence without objective moral facts, and the essay itself emphasizes conformity incentives and bargaining elsewhere, which makes the omission somewhat salient. Still, it only partially undercuts the essay\u2019s argument: (i) convergence to stable conventions is not obviously the same as convergence to the very specific, \u201cmostly-great\u201d target the authors care about; (ii) coordination-driven convergence may select for legibility/legitimacy/peace rather than for what any given idealized preference ranking would treat as near-best; and (iii) the essay can reply that such attractors might still leave large axiology-relevant variance (or converge on a compromise that is far from near-best under many views).\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: the claimed convergence forces are real and relevant, but the critique somewhat overstates how strongly they \u2018collapse\u2019 moral space and how directly they induce convergence on an idealization procedure (instrumental coordination may yield compliance without deep motivational/reflective convergence). The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",
