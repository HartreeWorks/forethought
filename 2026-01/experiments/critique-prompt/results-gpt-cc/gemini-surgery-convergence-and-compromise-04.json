  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key move in \u00a72.4.1: that, conditional on moral realism, the correct morality is probably motivationally alien, undermining WAM-convergence. This matters because \u00a72.4 is presented as a main argument against expecting WAM-convergence even under good conditions. However, it\u2019s not fully central to the overall essay\u2019s bottom line (which also leans on antirealism cases, blockers, and trade/threat dynamics), so centrality is moderate rather than high. The counterexample (naturalist/constructivist-leaning realism where moral facts track human flourishing/anti-suffering norms and thus motivate) does substantially weaken the claim that realism predictably hurts motivation, but it doesn\u2019t show the paper\u2019s premise is false\u2014only that it\u2019s underargued and contingent on which realist theories have most credence. The critique is largely correct and clearly stated, with minimal fluff, and it stays focused on a single issue. Overall it poses a nontrivial but not devastating problem: it pressures the essay to justify its probability distribution over realist moral theories rather than assuming \u2018alienness\u2019.",
