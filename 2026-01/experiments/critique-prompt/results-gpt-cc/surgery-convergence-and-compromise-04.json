  "reasoning": "The critique targets a support beam for the essay\u2019s optimism about partial AM-convergence + trade: the claim that advanced tech/superintelligence yields very low transaction costs via highly enforceable (\u201ciron-clad\u201d) contracts, enabling large realized gains from moral trade. If that assumption fails, the trade pathway becomes significantly less reliable (though not eliminated), so centrality is moderate-high rather than maximal because the essay also flags blockers, imperfect realization of trade, and other determinants of outcomes. The critique\u2019s argument is reasonably strong: verifiability/auditing problems, hidden side effects, and light-speed separation plausibly make contract completeness non-binary and can undermine trust-based trade. However, it doesn\u2019t fully refute the position\u2019s more modest claims (that trade could still occur, that institutions might be built, that this is only one contributor), and some issues may be mitigated by future verification tech or institutional architectures, so strength is moderate. Most claims are plausible and largely correct, though the specific \u201cadverse-selection-dominated\u201d flip is more conjectural. The critique is clear, focused, and has little fluff.",
