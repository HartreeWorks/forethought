  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s key evaluative notions (\u201cmostly-great\u201d, \u201cnear-best\u201d, \u201caccurate/correct moral view\u201d) that underpin its probabilistic talk about Flourishing and the strategic upshots about convergence/trade, so it is moderately central. However, it only notes under-specification and does not show that the essay\u2019s claims fail under any reasonable precisification; much of the essay is qualitative/conditional and sometimes explicitly treats these notions as vague, so the objection only modestly weakens the argument rather than substantially refuting it. The point about multiple meanings of \u2018accuracy\u2019 and their implications is largely correct and clearly stated, with minimal extraneous material, and it sticks to a single issue.",
  "title": "Key normative terms are too ambiguous to support the probabilistic conclusions"
