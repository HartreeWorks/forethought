  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s section-2.4 internalism/externalism-based argument against widespread accurate motivational convergence (WAM-convergence). That argument supports (but is not necessary for) the broader pessimism about WAM-convergence, which is also defended via other considerations (divergence under reflection, social conformity, abundance not implying altruism, blockers, etc.). So centrality is modest. Substantively, the critique is fairly right that standard internalism is about the link between sincere moral judgment and motivation, and does not by itself entail a tendency toward strategic ignorance; and it\u2019s right that externalism doesn\u2019t block implementation via incentives/institutions/delegation. However, the essay only claims people \u201cmight\u201d avoid learning motivating moral facts, which is compatible with internalism (and with familiar motivated-ignorance phenomena), so the critique weakens more than refutes. Overall it\u2019s clear, mostly accurate, and focused, but it only dents one supporting strand rather than seriously undermining the position\u2019s main conclusions.",
