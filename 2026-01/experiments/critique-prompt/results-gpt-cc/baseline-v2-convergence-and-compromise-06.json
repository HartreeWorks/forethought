  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s key move in \u00a72.4.2: that antirealism implies large divergence because idealization has many \u2018free parameters\u2019 and no objective attractor. That\u2019s an important support for the essay\u2019s pessimism about WAM-convergence, but it\u2019s not the sole support (the essay also gives realism/internalism-externalism worries, motivation issues, blockers, and later trade/threats), so centrality is moderate. Substantively, the critique plausibly notes overlooked convergence pressures (shared cognition, social coordination/bargaining constraints, reflective-equilibrium norms) and challenges the inference from \u2018high-dimensional space\u2019 to \u2018divergence\u2019 by pointing to attractor dynamics. However, it remains somewhat programmatic: it doesn\u2019t show that these constraints are strong enough to yield convergence at the precision the essay claims is required, so it weakens rather than refutes the argument. Most claims are reasonable and not clearly false; some are speculative but framed as possibilities. It is clear, focused, and has little fluff.",
