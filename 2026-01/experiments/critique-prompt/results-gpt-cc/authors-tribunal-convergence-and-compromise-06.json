  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s reliance on the \u201capproximately linear-in-resources, non-discounting\u201d preference class, which the essay uses as a key pivot for (i) whether abundance yields altruistic allocation and (ii) whether moral trade/compromise is likely to produce mostly-great futures. Undermining that pivot would weaken an important branch of the essay\u2019s argument about trade pessimism (especially \u00a73.2/\u00a73.4), but would not collapse the broader thesis (which also leans heavily on anti-/realism, motivation, threats, power concentration, and institutional blockers). The objection has moderate strength: it plausibly shows under-justification and a potential knife-edge in how conclusions shift across preference-curvature regimes, but it doesn\u2019t provide a positive case that linearity is unlikely, nor does it fully engage with the essay\u2019s own acknowledgements of uncertainty and partial robustness claims. The critique is mostly correct, clear, focused, and contains little fluff.",
