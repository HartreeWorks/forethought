  "reasoning": "The critique targets the intro \u201cpowered flight / natural selection\u201d analogy and the associated inference that future society may \u2018hone in\u2019 on a mostly-great future. That analogy is part of the essay\u2019s framing, but it is not a load-bearing premise for the essay\u2019s main conclusions (which are largely pessimistic about WAM-convergence and then pivot to trade/compromise plus threats). So centrality is limited. Still, the point is a real weakness in that specific rhetorical move: moral/value optimization lacks shared, externally validated feedback and is prone to proxy-target optimization, so the analogy can mislead unless supplemented with a mechanism for shared, incentive-compatible moral error signals. The critique is mostly correct and clearly expressed, with little extraneous content, and it stays focused on a single issue. Overall it modestly weakens one supporting illustration but does not seriously threaten the core argument of the position.",
  "title": "The flight analogy fails because moral feedback loops lack the legibility of engineering"
