  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific sub-argument in \u00a72.4.1: under moral realism, the true view is likely alien and thus non-motivational (or avoided). That claim contributes to (but is not the sole basis of) the essay\u2019s skepticism about WAM-convergence; the essay also leans heavily on the anti-realist branch, plus various blockers and sociological dynamics. So centrality is moderate-low (~0.3). The proposed reversal\u2014alienness/objectivity making moral truth a Schelling point for legitimacy/coordination\u2014does weaken the inference from \u201calien\u201d to \u201cnon-motivating,\u201d especially in a post-AGI institutional context. But it\u2019s not a decisive refutation: it relies on speculative assumptions about how often agents/institutions will treat moral truth as focal (vs. pursue parochial goals), and it doesn\u2019t engage the essay\u2019s separate worry that many agents may not want de dicto moral deference at all, or may strategically choose advisors/procedures that don\u2019t \u2018certify\u2019 alien conclusions. Hence moderate strength (~0.4). The critique is largely plausible and internally coherent, though some claims (e.g., robust certification across reflective procedures) are contestable/underspecified, so correctness is good but not near-1. Clarity is high, dead weight is minimal, and it focuses on a single issue.",
