  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific step in the essay\u2019s argument against WAM-convergence: the move from moral realism to expecting the correct morality to be \u201cweird/alien\u201d relative to current preferences (and thus non-motivating). This matters to the realism branch of section 2.4, but the essay\u2019s overall pessimism about WAM-convergence also rests on antirealism/divergence, motivational issues (internalism/externalism), blockers, and the trade/threats analysis\u2014so refuting this step would weaken but not collapse the overall position (moderate centrality). The critique has some bite because realism by itself doesn\u2019t entail strong discontinuity from evolved/social preferences; many realist views are compatible with continuity, so the essay needs additional premises to get \u2018alienness\u2019. Still, it doesn\u2019t fully refute the essay\u2019s claim (the essay says \u2018probably\u2019 and could add premises about how demanding/impersonal morality might be), so strength is moderate. The factual/philosophical claims are largely correct (realism \u2260 alienness; Cornell/naturalist realism plausibly allows continuity), though they don\u2019t establish the opposite conclusion. It is clear, focused, and contains essentially no dead weight.",
