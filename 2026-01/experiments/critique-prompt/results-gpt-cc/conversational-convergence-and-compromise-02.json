  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real supporting move in the essay\u2014its \u201crandom walk\u201d intuition for why reflection increases divergence, and the associated downplaying of convergence mechanisms under antirealism. If successful, this would moderately weaken the paper\u2019s pessimism about WAM-convergence (and strengthen the \u2018trade/constitution\u2019 route), but it wouldn\u2019t overturn the essay\u2019s broader case because multiple independent arguments remain (metaethical alienness/motivation, lock-in/blockers, threats, concentration of power). The critique\u2019s argument is plausible but underdeveloped: it asserts that shared empirical/strategic constraints and bargaining equilibria can produce convergence, but doesn\u2019t show they yield (i) convergence on the good de dicto (motivation), (ii) convergence fine-grained enough to hit the paper\u2019s \u201cnarrow target,\u201d or (iii) convergence to anything \u2018accurate\u2019 rather than merely stable/legible/legitimate. Most claims are reasonable as possibilities, though somewhat overstated (coordination pressures can also entrench local optima or superficial conformity, as the essay notes). The critique is clear, focused on one issue, and has little extraneous material.",
