  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s claim that even a small amount of executed value-destroying threats can destroy most value on many views, and the related practical takeaway that threat-prevention should be prioritized even if costly. This is an important lever in the essay\u2019s assessment of the promise of \u201cpartial AM-convergence + trade,\u201d but it is not the essay\u2019s central conclusion (which is broader pessimism about WAM-convergence and mixed optimism about trade with multiple blockers). Hence moderate centrality. The countermodel (high monitoring, strong anti-threatener coalition norms, cheap enforcement) is coherent and does show a plausible class of equilibria where threats are endogenously rare, weakening the \u2018load-bearing\u2019 role of threats. However, it doesn\u2019t directly refute the paper\u2019s more general worry (threats could be hard to prevent; monitoring/punishment may be unstable or costly; commitment might be hidden; coalitions may fail), and it relies on strong assumptions, so strength is only moderate. Most statements are correct as conditional possibilities; they are speculative but not erroneous. The critique is clear, focused, and has little extraneous material.",
