  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s \u201cabundance + diminishing marginal utility may shift spending toward altruistic ends\u201d argument (2.3.2). That mechanism is not central to the essay\u2019s overall conclusion (the essay is already pessimistic about WAM-convergence and explicitly notes linear/convex non-altruistic preferences and weak wealth\u2013altruism correlation), so centrality is modest. The critique has some bite against the specific diminishing-returns-to-selfishness story by pointing out that self-modification could preserve/engineer linear or convex selfish utility, undermining the predicted shift; however, much of this concern is already anticipated in the essay\u2019s own caveats, limiting additional refutational force. The main claims are broadly plausible but somewhat overstated (agents may not be able/willing to \u201csimply edit\u201d preferences; selection/outcompete dynamics are asserted rather than argued), so correctness is good but not near-perfect. It is clear, focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
