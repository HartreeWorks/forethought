  "reasoning": "The critique targets a meaningful premise in the essay\u2019s pessimism about WAM-convergence: that de dicto motivation is psychologically rare/unnatural among power-holders. If that premise is weakened, the essay\u2019s conclusion that widespread motivational convergence is unlikely is correspondingly weakened (moderate centrality), though much of the essay\u2019s pessimism also comes from metaethical non-convergence/\u2018fussiness\u2019, threats, lock-in, and power concentration, which this critique doesn\u2019t address. The argument offered\u2014instrumental adoption of impartial/de dicto morality for legitimacy, trust, coalition stability, and cultural internalization\u2014is plausible and relevant, but underspecified and does not show that such institutionalized impartiality would (a) be widespread in the relevant post-AGI settings, (b) remain stable under high-stakes power, or (c) yield accuracy about the good rather than merely convenient procedural norms; hence only modest strength. The claims are broadly reasonable (high correctness) and clearly stated, with little extraneous material and a single focused point.",
