  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important enabling assumption behind the essay\u2019s optimism about moral trade (that superintelligence makes \u201ciron-clad contracts\u201d straightforward, lowering friction and supporting compromise). If that assumption fails, a meaningful part of the essay\u2019s best-case pathway (partial AM-convergence + trade) is weakened, though the essay already highlights threats, institutions, and collective decision-making as major uncertainties, so the whole position doesn\u2019t collapse (moderate centrality). The objection is moderately strong: enforcement/adjudication does plausibly require value-laden choices (personhood, permissible sanctions, property baselines), and a shared coercive substrate can become a lock-in \u201cconstitution\u201d problem. However, it likely overstates that this requires near-WAM agreement: (i) enforcement can be polycentric (multiple jurisdictions/DAOs/arbiters), (ii) parties can sometimes rely on self-enforcing or escrow-style mechanisms without a global moral constitution, and (iii) the essay\u2019s own discussion of threats/anti-threat legal systems already partially anticipates the non-neutrality problem. Overall it\u2019s clear, focused, and mostly correct, with little extraneous material, but it only partially refutes the trade story rather than decisively undermining it.",
