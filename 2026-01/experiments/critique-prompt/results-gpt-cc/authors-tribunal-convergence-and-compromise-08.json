  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central optimistic pathway in the essay: that partial AM-convergence plus trade/compromise could plausibly deliver a mostly-great future. It points out (plausibly) that what matters is not the headcount rate of AM-convergence but AM-convergers\u2019 share of decisive strategic control during the lock-in window\u2014an interaction the essay notes qualitatively (power concentration, lock-in) but does not integrate into the trade pathway\u2019s viability. This would weaken the degree of optimism one should take from \u00a73, but it does not collapse the essay\u2019s overall position because the essay already emphasizes uncertainty and explicitly lists these as blockers rather than assuming them away. The objection is largely correct and clearly stated, with little extraneous material, but its refutational force is limited because it mainly demands quantitative integration/back-of-the-envelope modeling rather than showing that, under the essay\u2019s own assumptions, the trade route is unlikely.",
  "title": "Partial AM-convergence ignores decisive power concentration during lock-in, overstating trade viability"
