  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key step in \u00a72.4.1: that moral realism makes the true morality likely \u201calien/distant\u201d and thus less motivational, supporting pessimism about WAM-convergence even under good conditions. This matters to the essay\u2019s anti-WAM case, but it\u2019s only one pillar (the essay also argues antirealism yields divergence, plus separate motivational/blocker considerations), so centrality is moderate rather than decisive. The objection is fairly strong: realism alone doesn\u2019t imply a prior over moral truths skewed toward \u201cweirdness,\u201d and many realist views (reasons/agency-based, some constructivist-leaning realisms, etc.) could predict substantial overlap with human concerns, so the essay plausibly needs extra argument to justify the \u201calienness\u201d likelihood claim. Still, it doesn\u2019t fully overturn the essay\u2019s broader skepticism, since motivation and convergence could fail for other reasons even on realism. The critique is mostly correct, clearly stated, tightly focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
