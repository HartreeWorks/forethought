  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific step in \u00a72.4.1: the essay\u2019s suggestion that (given moral realism) the true morality is probably \u2018weird/alien\u2019 and thus unlikely to motivate, thereby undermining WAM-convergence. This is an important supporting consideration in the essay\u2019s broader case against WAM-convergence, but it is not the essay\u2019s sole or decisive pillar (the essay also argues from antirealism/nonconvergence, motivational constraints, blockers, and then shifts weight to partial convergence + trade). So centrality is moderate. The critique\u2019s main move\u2014realism need not imply radical alienness, since many realist views can connect moral truth to facts about flourishing/cooperation/reasons, making the truth potentially only moderately revisionary\u2014genuinely weakens the \u2018alienness as default\u2019 expectation, but it doesn\u2019t decisively refute the essay\u2019s pessimism (realism could still be revisionary, motivation could still fail, and the essay already hedges rather than proving alienness). Most claims are broadly correct and on-point, though they are somewhat programmatic (no detailed argument for why these realist theories should predict nearby truths, and realism can be compatible with quite revisionary ethics). The critique is clear, focused, and contains little to no filler.",
