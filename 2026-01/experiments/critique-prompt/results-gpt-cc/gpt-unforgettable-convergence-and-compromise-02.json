  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central evaluative scaffold in the essay: repeated appeal to \u201cthe correct moral view\u201d and to a unified notion of \u201cmostly-great\u201d/\u201cFlourishing,\u201d including in the trade/threats sections. If that scaffold were illegitimate, it would weaken a substantial chunk of the essay\u2019s comparative assessments (including how threats \u2018eat most value\u2019 and how to interpret numeric Flourishing estimates). However, the essay itself partially anticipates the issue by explicitly discussing moral uncertainty and by sometimes shifting to \u2018preferred view\u2019 / \u2018many views gain from trade\u2019 framing, so the position doesn\u2019t fully depend on a single privileged metric in all places. The objection is directionally right (antirealism undermines mind-independent \u2018correctness\u2019), but it overstates the extent to which the whole analysis becomes impossible: an antirealist can still use stance-relative \u2018correctness,\u2019 or explicitly adopt a moral-uncertainty aggregation procedure, without conditionalizing everything on realism. Hence moderate strength, good correctness, high clarity, minimal dead weight, and it stays focused on one main issue.",
