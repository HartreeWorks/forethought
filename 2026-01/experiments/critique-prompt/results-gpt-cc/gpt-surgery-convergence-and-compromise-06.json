  "reasoning": "The critique targets a sub-step in the essay\u2019s broader case against WAM-convergence: the claim (in the realism+internalism discussion) that internalism makes agents avoid learning motivating moral truths. That step matters to one strand of the pessimism about WAM-convergence, but the overall position is supported by many other considerations (anti-realism case, divergence/random-walk reflection, blockers, threats, trade), so centrality is moderate-low. The critique has moderate strength: it shows the internalism\u2192avoidance inference is not directionally robust, offering plausible alternative dynamics (precommitment/institutions to force exposure; selection/competition favoring motivating truth-tracking moral beliefs). However, it doesn\u2019t decisively refute the essay\u2019s overall realism-based pessimism, since avoidance/self-deception can still dominate in many plausible environments and the essay only gestures at avoidance as a possibility rather than proving it as the default. Most claims are plausible though somewhat speculative (especially the selection argument), and it is clear, focused, and largely free of filler.",
