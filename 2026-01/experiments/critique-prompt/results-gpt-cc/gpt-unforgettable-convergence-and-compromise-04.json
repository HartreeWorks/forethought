  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central pillar of the essay\u2019s conditional optimism: that partial AM-convergence plus low transaction costs/strong contracting can realize large gains from moral trade. If trade systematically degrades into brinkmanship, the essay\u2019s most promising route to \u201cmostly-great\u201d futures weakens materially (though not totally, since the essay already allows for threats/blockers and doesn\u2019t claim trade is robustly sufficient). The objection is moderately strong: it identifies a plausible, under-discussed dynamic in a self-modification-capable world (endogenous preference hardening/credible commitment to refusal/extremal utilities) that can worsen disagreement points and increase extortion, thereby reducing gains from compromise. However, it\u2019s not a full refutation: it\u2019s largely a mechanism sketch without showing (i) that such self-mod arms races are equilibrium-dominant across plausible institutions, (ii) that agents can/cannot be prevented from, or disincentivized from, such commitment strategies, or (iii) that the essay\u2019s already-noted \u201cthreats\u201d discussion doesn\u2019t already partially cover this dynamic. Most claims are conceptually correct as possibilities, and the point is clearly stated with minimal fluff. Overall it poses a nontrivial but not decisive problem for the trade story.",
