  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s discussion of preventing value-destroying threats via some anti-threat legal/institutional order. That topic is relevant to the paper\u2019s optimism about trade/compromise, but it is not a linchpin of the overall argument (the essay already treats threats as potentially decisive and explicitly says it\u2019s not obvious a mutually agreeable, stable legal system can prevent them). Because the essay is already skeptical/uncertain about institutional prevention of threats, the critique only modestly weakens the position rather than overturning it. The institutional-capture/principal\u2013agent story is plausible and concrete, but the key claim that the paper \u2018implicitly assumes\u2019 a stable, non-gameable anti-threat legal system is somewhat inaccurate given the paper\u2019s explicit caveat, so correctness is moderate-high rather than near-1. The critique is focused, clear, and has little fluff.",
