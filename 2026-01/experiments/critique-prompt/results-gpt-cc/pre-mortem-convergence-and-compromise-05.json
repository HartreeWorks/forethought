  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central pillar of the essay\u2019s optimism: that partial AM-convergence plus low-transaction-cost bargaining/trade can plausibly yield mostly-great futures (section 3). If moral trade systematically induces an arms race toward commitment/rigidity via self-modification, that undercuts a large share of the intended gains-from-trade story, though it wouldn\u2019t refute the whole essay (which already notes blockers, threats, institutional fragility, and value divergence). The argument has decent force: in bargaining theory, credible commitment can improve outcomes; in a world of editable minds and automated negotiators, endogenous preference/commitment engineering is a live, nontrivial dynamic the essay doesn\u2019t explicitly address. However, it\u2019s not a knockdown refutation because the position is conditional and could potentially be patched (e.g., institutions/constitutions restricting self-modification, bargaining protocols that penalize commitment-types, enforcement that blocks coercive adjudication, or coordination against rigidity races). The critique is clear, focused on one mechanism, and contains little fluff. Its main weakness is that it asserts a strong empirical trajectory (\u201calmost everyone\u201d hardens; bargain space collapses) without supporting model/evidence, so it\u2019s best read as a plausible failure mode rather than a demonstrated outcome.",
