  "reasoning": "The critique targets one specific inference in \u00a73.5: that concentrating power is straightforwardly a blocker because it reduces the probability that the (correct / AM-convergent) moral view is represented among decision-makers. That claim matters to the paper\u2019s optimism about \u201cpartial AM-convergence + trade\u201d pathways, but it\u2019s not central to the essay\u2019s overall case (which also rests heavily on skepticism about WAM-convergence, the role of threats, lock-in, and other blockers). The critique has moderate strength: it plausibly shows the monotonic \u2018more concentration \u21d2 worse\u2019 inference relies on something like an independence/no-positive-selection assumption, and that plausible selection effects could reverse the direction. However, it doesn\u2019t establish that selection into power is in fact positively correlated with de dicto moral motivation or \u201ccorrectness,\u201d nor does it address countervailing selection pressures (e.g., self-interest, willingness to use coercion, ideological extremity), so it weakens the argument rather than refuting it. Most claims are conceptually correct and well-posed, the point is clear, tightly focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
