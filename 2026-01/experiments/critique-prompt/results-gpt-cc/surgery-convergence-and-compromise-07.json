  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s main remaining optimistic pathway (partial AM-convergence + trade/compromise) by arguing that threat-capability can become endogenously selected-for, shifting bargaining equilibria toward coercion and away from morally-motivated agents. If true, this would substantially weaken the trade-based optimism, though it wouldn\u2019t fully collapse the overall essay (which already treats threats as a major obstacle and also discusses other routes like WAM-convergence). The argument is conceptually plausible and adds a distinct \u201cdynamic selection\u201d mechanism beyond the essay\u2019s mostly static treatment of threats, but it is also speculative and under-argued (no modeling, conditions, or countervailing institutional dynamics), and some of the worry is partially \u201cpriced in\u201d by the essay\u2019s existing acknowledgment that extortion can transfer resources even absent execution and that threats may be hard to prevent. It\u2019s clearly presented, focused on one point, and contains little fluff.",
