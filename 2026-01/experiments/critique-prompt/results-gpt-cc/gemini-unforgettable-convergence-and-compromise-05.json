  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s use of \u201cWAM-convergence\u201d as a benchmark and its realism/anti-realism fork in \u00a72.4, claiming this makes the WAM category incoherent or unstable and thus undermines the paper\u2019s scenario-partition. That is moderately central: WAM is a major organizing concept in section 2, but the paper\u2019s overall thrust is that WAM is unlikely and that partial AM + trade is the more promising path, so even if WAM were ill-posed the main conclusion could largely survive with reframing. The argument has some force in highlighting a tension: if \u2018accuracy\u2019 is cashed out in different ways across metaethics, treating WAM as a unified yardstick can be conceptually slippery. However, it overstates: anti-realism needn\u2019t make \u2018accuracy\u2019 incoherent (it can be indexed to idealized/endorsed standards), and realism doesn\u2019t imply the truth is motivationally \u2018toxic\u2019 or generally avoided; the paper itself already gestures at these nuances. So it weakens the framing more than it refutes the substance. The critique is clear, focused, and has little filler.",
