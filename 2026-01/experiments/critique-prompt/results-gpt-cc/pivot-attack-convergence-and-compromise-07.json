  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important hinge in the essay\u2019s \u201cpartial AM-convergence + trade\u201d optimism: that value-destroying threats might be preventable by a stable, mutually agreeable enforcement regime. If that hope fails, trade plausibly loses much of its promise on many axiologies, so the attacked point is moderately central. However, the essay itself already flags this exact worry (it explicitly says it\u2019s \u201cnot obvious\u201d such a system is stable), so the critique is partly \u2018priced in\u2019 and doesn\u2019t newly undermine a confident claim. Argumentatively, the critique offers a plausible enforcement trilemma (surveillance/sanctions/jurisdiction \u2192 hegemon vs evasion) but it\u2019s not close to decisive: it assumes strong requirements (e.g., broad surveillance and cross-bloc jurisdiction) and doesn\u2019t engage possible institutional workarounds (cryptographic auditability, limited-purpose adjudication, decentralized commitment devices, capability restrictions, etc.), so it weakens rather than refutes. Most claims are reasonable but somewhat speculative (institutional feasibility assertions are not established), hence mid-high correctness. It\u2019s clear, tightly focused, and contains little fluff.",
