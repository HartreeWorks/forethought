  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real support-strand of the essay: Section 2\u2019s use of cross-moral-view disagreement/history to motivate \u201cmany independent ways to lose most value,\u201d which feeds the overall \u201ctarget is narrow\u201d/fragility picture. However, the position does not rest mainly on that catalogue: much of the argument is (i) within-view fragility (single-flaw dominance, population ethics, digital minds, etc. can remain live even under shared meta-constraints) and (ii) the Section 3 claim that most plausible value functions are fussy for structural reasons (linearity, boundedness, goods/bads aggregation), largely independent of today\u2019s surface-level moral pluralism. So if the critique landed, it would weaken but not collapse the thesis (moderate centrality). The objection is suggestive but under-argued: it posits that reflection yields anti-fanaticism/veil-of-ignorance style constraints that prune many \u201ccatastrophes,\u201d but doesn\u2019t show that such convergence is likely, stable, or strong enough to eliminate the key failure modes (e.g., population ethics, digital moral status, aggregation of bads). The paper can also reply that these examples are illustrative of non-obviousness and persistent moral risk, not a claim that all currently held views remain plausible after reflection (moderate-low strength). It is highly relevant to Forethought\u2019s Tier-3 agenda on moral convergence/compromise and how reflection changes the reference class of \u201cplausible\u201d views.",
