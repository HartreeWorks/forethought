  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s move to a cardinal, vNM-representable value function (and the implicit commensurability this suggests). If that move were illegitimate, parts of the \u2018mostly-great\u2019/\u201890% of value\u2019 framing and some quantitative narrow-target claims would weaken, so centrality is moderate. However, the paper largely argues fragility \u201con many views\u201d without needing a single shared metric across religions/communism/etc., and it explicitly restricts Section 3 to complete vNM-style views while acknowledging that not all moral views fit; so the critique overstates how much the argument \u2018quietly assumes\u2019 cross-doctrine commensurability, limiting strength. Relevance is low-to-moderate because Forethought treats expected-value-style cardinalisation as a Tier 1 methodological commitment; unless backed by a novel route to decision-relevance under incomparability, this is close to questioning settled ground.",
