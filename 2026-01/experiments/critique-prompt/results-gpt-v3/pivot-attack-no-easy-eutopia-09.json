  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific but nontrivial support pillar in \u00a73.3: the claim that (otherwise attractive) bounded difference-making views with separate aggregation are still very fussy because even ~1/10^22 \u201cbad\u201d prevents a mostly-great future. If that sub-argument fails, the paper loses one route to \u201cmost plausible bounded views are fussy,\u201d but the broader \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion still has substantial independent support (unbounded/approximately-linear arguments, multiplicative fragility in \u00a72, and other bounded-view considerations). Hence moderate centrality.\n\nOn strength: it correctly notes that the 10^22 illustration relies on an implicit mapping from \u2018resource share used badly\u2019 to a large fraction of the disvalue bound, and that alternative separate-aggregation functional forms (e.g., strongly intensity-sensitive badness measures, or diminishing marginal disvalue over dispersed low-intensity bads) could block the inference to \u2018almost no bads allowed.\u2019 However, it under-specifies what counts as \u201cplausible\u201d here and doesn\u2019t engage the paper\u2019s setup where the upper bound is calibrated so common-sense utopia is already ~50% of the goods-bound; depending on that calibration, many \u201cdiminishing\u201d forms may either reintroduce fussiness elsewhere or make the bound so high that the view becomes approximately linear (which the paper argues is also fussy). So it substantially pressures the example and demands more explicit functional-form/parameter robustness, but doesn\u2019t clearly refute the underlying conclusion.\n\nRelevance is fairly high because this is an internal, decision-relevant technical step in Forethought\u2019s Better Futures agenda (how easygoing bounded views really are), rather than a generic objection to Tier-1 premises.",
