  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific but real load-bearing step in \u00a73.3: the move from \u201cbounded w.r.t. universe-as-a-whole\u201d to \u201capproximately linear in practice\u201d via the claim that humanity\u2019s marginal contribution is tiny because the universe is (likely) vastly larger than the observable region and contains many value-bearing alien civilizations. If that empirical/cosmological package fails, then the paper loses one of its main routes for arguing that many bounded views are still effectively linear (and hence fussy). However, this is not the paper\u2019s only route to \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019: the multiplicative-fragility case in \u00a72, the fussiness of unbounded linear views, and the fussiness of many difference-making bounded views (especially with separate aggregation of goods/bads) would remain. So centrality is moderate rather than high.\n\nOn strength: the objection correctly identifies that the linearization argument depends on substantive empirical assumptions (rare life/Great Filter ahead, sparse-value cosmology, and the size of our future light-cone) and that, under alternative cosmologies, concavity might bite at the scale of what humanity controls, potentially making some bounded concave views more \u2018easygoing\u2019. That said, it doesn\u2019t fully show that bounded-universe views would in fact be easygoing (it gestures at diminishing returns but doesn\u2019t address other sources of fussiness the paper raises, like bads sensitivity or fat-tailed value-efficiency), and the authors could partially patch by making the conclusion conditional or by offering alternative reasons our marginal impact is small even without abundant aliens. Relevance is moderate: it engages a Tier-2-style empirical assumption/cross-domain link (cosmology \u2192 moral aggregation behavior) rather than a clearly identified Tier-3 live dispute, but it is still decision-relevant for their taxonomy of \u201cmost bounded views are fussy\u201d. Overall is therefore modest.",
