  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important implication/extension of the paper\u2019s thesis (that recognizing eutopian fragility and moral-risk \u201cfussiness\u201d could itself induce a meta-failure mode: paralysis and centralized veto power). However, it does not directly refute the core claim that near-best futures are a narrow target under many plausible moral views; at most it argues that adopting/acting on the thesis could worsen outcomes. The paper also briefly flags the \u2018hyper-vigilant\u2019 failure mode already, so the point is partially \u201cpriced in,\u201d though the critique usefully foregrounds a concrete political mechanism (weaponized moral uncertainty \u2192 veto institutions become sovereign). The argument is plausible but underdeveloped: it doesn\u2019t show the dynamic is likely/robust, quantify when it dominates, or engage with obvious patches (decision procedures under moral uncertainty, sunset clauses/renegotiation, anti-veto institutional design). It is quite relevant to Forethought\u2019s agenda because it connects eutopian fragility claims to Tier-1/2 concerns about power concentration and lock-in, and to live Tier-3 governance questions about institutional design under deep moral uncertainty.",
