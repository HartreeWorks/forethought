  "reasoning": "The critique targets a central move in the paper\u2019s Section 2 argument for \u201ceutopian fragility\u201d: that many first-order moral hazards are (roughly) independent, so value is plausibly multiplicative and mostly-great futures are rare. If governance-level corrigibility strongly couples many hazards, that weakens the inference from \u201cmany hazards\u201d to \u201cnarrow target.\u201d However, it doesn\u2019t engage much with Section 3\u2019s more formal claim that most plausible value functions are fussy (which could sustain \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 even given corrigible institutions), so it\u2019s not maximally central. On strength: the objection is conceptually apt and points to a real missing step (the paper should argue that even strong error-correction institutions don\u2019t broaden the target much), but it is largely asserted rather than defended\u2014e.g., it doesn\u2019t show that these meta-institutions are feasible/stable under AI-enabled lock-in dynamics, nor that they address key hazards like scale/space resource capture or fat-tailed value-efficiency. The paper also already gestures at meta-level perils (corrigibility could be unstable/exploitable/value-corrosive), which partially pre-empts the objection. Relevance is high because it directly bears on Forethought\u2019s active concerns about lock-in, institutions, and governance design (a cross-tier interaction between \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 and institutional corrigibility). Overall, it\u2019s a useful, agenda-relevant challenge that moderately weakens one important strand of the argument but falls short of a decisive refutation.",
