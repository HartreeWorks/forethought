  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s \u201cmoral uncertainty\u201d upshot (P3) that, under plausible intertheoretic comparison methods, unbounded/fussy views should loom larger, giving the \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 conclusion decision-theoretic bite. If that pivot fell, it would weaken the action-guiding synthesis (esp. implications for surviving-vs-flourishing prioritisation under moral uncertainty), but it would not overturn the core object-level claim that many individual plausible moral views are fussy and that value can be fragile/multiplicative. Strength is limited because it mostly notes a dependence the paper already explicitly concedes (normalization choices swing rankings) and does not provide a substantive positive case that an alternative normalization is more principled or widely acceptable\u2014so it pressures rhetoric/robustness more than it refutes the argument. Relevance is high: intertheoretic comparisons and how moral uncertainty interacts with \u201cfussiness\u201d is a live, decision-relevant Tier-3 area for Forethought\u2019s better-futures program. Overall impact is modest given moderate centrality and low-to-moderate incremental refutation.",
