  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important inferential move in the essay: sliding from \u201cmany ways to be morally wrong / narrow target\u201d to \u201cmostly-great futures are unlikely under realistic dynamics.\u201d If correct, this would weaken the paper\u2019s practical upshot that (absent deliberate steering) we should expect to miss most value. However, the paper\u2019s core thesis is primarily about target narrowness/fussiness (and multiplicative fragility) rather than a fully general claim that probability mass must be low; it even notes in the conclusion that a narrow target needn\u2019t imply low probability and defers \u2018guiding forces\u2019 to the next essay. So the attacked claim is only moderately central. The argument itself is suggestive but underdeveloped: it asserts that attractors/convergent pressures could concentrate probability mass, but offers no concrete model, empirical evidence, or engagement with the paper\u2019s explicit conditioning on \u2018no serious coordinated de dicto optimisation,\u2019 nor with examples where dynamics plausibly select systematically wrong equilibria. Relevance is high because it speaks directly to Forethought\u2019s active questions about predetermination, moral attractors/convergence vs the need for steering, and thus the survival-vs-flourishing prioritisation debate. Overall, it\u2019s a potentially important direction but presently more of a gap-pointing objection than a substantive refutation.",
