  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s percentile-based definition/normalisation of \u201cbest feasible future\u201d (99.99th percentile set to 1) and the resulting 0.5/0.9 cutoffs for \u201cmostly-great\u201d/\u201cnear-best.\u201d This is moderately central because the paper uses those thresholds to frame how \u201chard\u201d eutopia is and to motivate intuitions like common-sense utopia falling far below 0.5; if the scaling is artifactually stretched by extreme tail scenarios, the headline \u2018mostly-great is rare\u2019 could be partly definitional. However, much of the essay\u2019s case for fussiness also comes from substantive claims (many independent moral dimensions, population ethics/digital minds issues, bounded vs unbounded value-function arguments), which would still support a narrow-target story even under different anchors, so the position wouldn\u2019t fully collapse. Strength is moderate: the objection is conceptually coherent and identifies a real sensitivity, but it doesn\u2019t show that the 99.99th percentile is in fact typically \u201cpoisoned\u201d by a single exotic construction, nor that alternative reasonable anchoring schemes would materially reverse the rarity/fussiness conclusions; the authors also explicitly intend a \u2018best feasible\u2019 (not absolute maximum) anchor, which partially defuses the \u2018tautology\u2019 charge. Relevance is high because it engages a methodological choice internal to Forethought\u2019s Better Futures framework (how to operationalise \u2018best feasible\u2019/value loss), rather than disputing Tier-1 premises, and would help refine their quantitative framing if developed further. Overall impact is therefore limited but nontrivial.",
