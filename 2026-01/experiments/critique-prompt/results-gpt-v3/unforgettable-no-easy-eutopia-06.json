  "reasoning": "The critique targets one of the paper\u2019s illustrative \u201cfragility\u201d dimensions (scale-insensitivity / population-size choices) and argues it may not remain a robust failure mode under competent reflection, pushing the authors to distinguish reflection-resistant vs reflection-fixable mistakes. If successful, this would weaken one strand of the Section 2.3 case and modestly undercut the independence/product-of-factors intuition, but it would not collapse the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion because the paper offers many other alleged fragile dimensions (digital welfare, wellbeing theories, governance/lock-in, bads sensitivity, etc.) and later sections argue fussiness more generally from value-function structure. The objection has some force as a cross-section consistency check (the essay gestures at truth-seeking deliberation/convergence as a possible steering force), but it overstates the tension: much of the essay conditions on no strong de dicto optimisation, and \u201cfixing scope insensitivity\u201d does not straightforwardly resolve population ethics or scale questions (which are deeply theory-dependent, not merely a consistency/factual-awareness bug). It is nevertheless highly relevant to Forethought\u2019s agenda because it highlights an important interaction between (i) deliberation/convergence mechanisms (Tier 3) and (ii) which fragilities should count as persistent vs wash-out, which bears directly on the narrow-target claim and on what interventions matter.",
