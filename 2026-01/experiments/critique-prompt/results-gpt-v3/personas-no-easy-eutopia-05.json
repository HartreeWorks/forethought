  "reasoning": "The critique targets an implied practical upshot of the paper\u2014if eutopia is a narrow target, we may need deliberate steering/optimization\u2014and argues that such steering would itself accelerate capabilities/coordination, worsening competitive dynamics and lock-in risks. This bears on how to act on the \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d diagnosis, but it does not directly refute the paper\u2019s main descriptive thesis that near-best futures are a narrow/fragile target across many moral views; the paper also explicitly brackets the \u2018will we steer successfully?\u2019 question for the next essay. Hence only moderate centrality. The argument is suggestive but underdeveloped: it assumes that any effective steering must involve building/wielding the strongest optimizer fastest, and that this predictably increases lock-in/expansion, but it doesn\u2019t show that steering can\u2019t be pursued via non-accelerative interventions (e.g., institutional constraints, slower takeoff strategies, differential development of \u201cwisdom\u201d tools) or that the paper\u2019s framing entails pro-capabilities racing. Relevance is high because it engages a cross-tier interaction Forethought cares about (flourishing/trajectory work vs power concentration and lock-in under competitive dynamics), closely connected to several Tier 3 tensions about acceleration vs governance and survival vs flourishing.",
