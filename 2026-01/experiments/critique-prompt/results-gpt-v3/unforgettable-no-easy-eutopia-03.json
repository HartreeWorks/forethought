  "reasoning": "The critique targets one supporting step in Section 3.2: the move from \u201cfat-tailed value-efficiency\u201d to \u201cmostly-great futures are a narrow target on linear views.\u201d If that step failed, it would weaken (but not overturn) the paper\u2019s broader \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d case, since the essay also relies on (i) scale requirements on linear views even without fat-tail exactingness, (ii) the multiplicative/fragility argument in Section 2, and (iii) bounded-view arguments in Section 3.3\u2014so centrality is moderate-low. As an objection, it\u2019s directionally plausible (fat tails + scalable search can make \u2018good enough\u2019 easy to find/replicate), but it\u2019s underspecified: it doesn\u2019t model the paper\u2019s key conditioning on limited de dicto optimization pressure, doesn\u2019t show that reachable search processes yield a high probability of landing in the top-value region, and doesn\u2019t address the possibility that fat tails mean a very small measure of configurations capture most value (still \u2018needle-y\u2019). Thus it only partially weakens the targeted inference. It is fairly relevant to Forethought\u2019s agenda because it engages a Tier-2-style premise/step (fat tails \u2192 fussiness) inside a core Better Futures argument and suggests a concrete needed distinction (\u201call imaginable uses\u201d vs \u201creachable under realistic optimization\u201d).",
