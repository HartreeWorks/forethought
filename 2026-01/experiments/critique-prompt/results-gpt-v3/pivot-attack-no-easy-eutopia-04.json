  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important supporting plank in Section 2.3/2.3.4: that key moral mistakes (digital personhood, space/resource allocation) can be effectively irreversible, so a single early flaw can permanently forfeit most value. If that irreversibility premise were broadly false, the paper\u2019s \u201cfragility\u201d/\u201cnarrow target\u201d story would be weakened. However, irreversibility is not the sole basis for the paper\u2019s conclusion: much of the case also comes from (i) many independent dimensions of value (multiplicative/product model), (ii) moral uncertainty and \u2018fussiness\u2019 across plausible value functions, and (iii) scale and value-efficiency arguments where even temporary long periods of misallocation can entail large losses. The objection is moderately strong: it plausibly points out that several examples (wellbeing theory, equality norms, banned goods) look corrigible under continued inquiry, and that the paper would need a more explicit \u201cuncorrectable before reflection\u201d mechanism/timing argument. But it remains largely programmatic: it doesn\u2019t show that correction is likely fast enough relative to expansion/lock-in, nor does it engage the paper\u2019s own lock-in-enabling mechanisms (e.g., defense-dominant control of space, institutional/power lock-in, value lock-in via AGI). Relevance is high because correctability vs lock-in is closely tied to Forethought\u2019s active research concerns about persistent path dependence/lock-in and how it interacts with flourishing work.",
