  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central pillar of the essay\u2019s conclusion\u2014its Section 3 claim that (roughly) \u201cmost plausible moral views are fussy\u201d and only a narrow slice are easygoing. If that generalization were substantially undermined, the overall \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 case would be meaningfully weakened (though not fully, because Section 2\u2019s \u201cmoral catastrophe is easy / value is fragile\u201d argument could still support narrow-target conclusions independently). However, the critique is mostly schematic: it lists families of moral theories (threshold deontology, pluralism, virtue ethics, contractualism) and asserts they might make \u201cmostly great\u201d a large target, but it doesn\u2019t show (i) that these views plausibly satisfy the paper\u2019s formal setup (completeness/VNM-style representability), (ii) that they really yield broad near-best regions under the paper\u2019s 0\u20131 normalization, or (iii) that they escape the paper\u2019s specific drivers of fussiness (scale sensitivity, fat-tailed value-efficiency, bads-vs-goods aggregation). So it raises a live worry about model class misspecification but only modestly weakens the argument as presented. It is relevant to Forethought\u2019s agenda because it bears directly on the Better Futures \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 thesis (a Tier-2 commitment), but it\u2019s not developed enough to strongly inform their active research directions.",
