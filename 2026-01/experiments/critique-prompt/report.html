                <pre># Critique of &quot;Convergence and Compromise: Will Society Aim for Good Futures?&quot;

## Persona: The Mechanism Designer

**Core assumption**: Any proposal without formal specification of equilibrium conditions, strategy spaces, and enforcement mechanisms is philosophical hand-waving that will fail when implemented.

**Steelman**: This paper attempts something genuinely difficult—mapping the conditions under which distributed moral agents might coordinate toward good outcomes despite heterogeneous preferences. The distinction between WAM-convergence and partial AM-convergence with trade is analytically useful, and the recognition that &quot;moral trade&quot; requires specific institutional conditions shows awareness that outcomes depend on mechanism design, not just intentions.

**Signature objection**:
- **Target**: Section 3.1&#x27;s claim that &quot;superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts&quot; and that &quot;transaction costs would generally be extremely small relative to the gains&quot;
- **Failure mode**: The paper treats contract enforcement as a solved problem once superintelligence exists, but never specifies *who enforces* contracts between groups with different values, *what constitutes breach* when parties have incommensurable metrics of compliance, or *how disputes are adjudicated* when the adjudicator&#x27;s values necessarily favor some parties over others. This is the contract theory equivalent of assuming a can opener.
- **Scenario**: In 2150, the Hedonic Maximizers and the Preference Satisfiers sign a resource-sharing agreement. The Hedonists create beings that report high satisfaction but have no preferences in the traditional sense. The Satisfiers claim this violates the agreement&#x27;s spirit; the Hedonists claim full compliance. There is no neutral arbiter—any superintelligent judge must have *some* theory of welfare to interpret &quot;compliance,&quot; and that theory will favor one party. The contract collapses into the very value disagreement it was meant to resolve. Meanwhile, a third party (the Objective List theorists) refuses to recognize the contract&#x27;s legitimacy at all, since it was negotiated by parties they consider morally confused.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: We acknowledge enforcement is non-trivial, but the key insight is that *mutual gains from trade exist* regardless of enforcement mechanism. Parties have incentives to create enforcement institutions because trade benefits them. The specific mechanism matters less than the existence of gains.

**Rebuttal**: This confuses the existence of potential gains with their realizability. The entire literature on mechanism design exists because &quot;mutual gains exist&quot; is insufficient—you need incentive-compatible mechanisms that make cooperation individually rational at every decision node. The paper&#x27;s optimism about trade rests on assuming these mechanisms exist without specifying them. Worse, when values are the *object* of trade rather than preferences over goods, standard results about efficient mechanisms may not apply—there&#x27;s no analog to the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem for moral trade, and the paper doesn&#x27;t even gesture at what such results might look like.

**Patch cost**: The authors must either (a) provide formal conditions under which moral trade mechanisms are incentive-compatible, including specification of enforcement, or (b) significantly downgrade their optimism about trade-based paths to good futures, acknowledging that the &quot;blockers&quot; in 3.5 may be the default rather than the exception.

## Persona: The Second-Order Catastrophist

**Core assumption**: The most dangerous proposals are those that succeed—I ask what disasters are enabled by the world where this paper&#x27;s recommendations are followed.

**Steelman**: The paper correctly identifies that partial convergence plus trade is more realistic than universal moral agreement, and thoughtfully considers how different axiological views fare under various trade regimes. The analysis of &quot;resource-compatibility&quot; between views is genuinely novel and helps clarify when compromise is possible versus when it merely papers over irreconcilable differences.

**Signature objection**:
- **Target**: Section 3.2&#x27;s framework for evaluating trade outcomes, and the paper&#x27;s general optimism that &quot;easily-satiable&quot; views can be cheaply satisfied while linear views divide remaining resources
- **Failure mode**: The paper assumes that identifying which views are &quot;easily satiable&quot; is straightforward and that satisfying them creates no path dependencies. But successfully satisfying bounded views *first* creates a coalition with no remaining stake in how unbounded views divide resources—and that coalition has every incentive to defect from further cooperation once their goals are met.
- **Scenario**: Suppose common-sense morality (bounded above) gets its &quot;common-sense utopia&quot; in the Milky Way, while total utilitarians and other linear views are promised the rest of the accessible universe. The common-sense coalition now has no skin in the game for what happens elsewhere. When a dispute arises between total utilitarians and negative utilitarians over Andromeda, the common-sense majority has no incentive to enforce the original agreement—indeed, they may prefer the dispute to weaken both parties. Alternatively, the common-sense coalition may decide that total utilitarian expansion constitutes an existential risk (what if they tile the universe with minimal minds?) and preemptively intervene. The paper&#x27;s &quot;optimistic&quot; scenario of satisfying bounded views first creates exactly the power imbalance that makes the remaining coordination problem unsolvable.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: We explicitly discuss threats in section 3.3 and acknowledge that &quot;even small risks of executed threats can easily eat into the expected value.&quot; The scenario described is a form of threat, and our analysis accounts for it.

**Rebuttal**: No—the scenario I describe is *not* a threat in your sense. The common-sense coalition isn&#x27;t threatening to destroy value to extract concessions; they&#x27;re simply *losing interest* in enforcing agreements that no longer benefit them. Your threat analysis assumes ongoing interdependence, but your trade framework creates a world where bounded views become independent of unbounded views&#x27; fates. You&#x27;ve designed a system where the parties most likely to reach satisfaction first are also the parties whose continued cooperation is most needed for the remaining coordination problems. This is a *structural* failure of the proposed framework, not an adversarial exploitation of it.

**Patch cost**: The authors must either (a) argue that bounded and unbounded views will remain interdependent even after bounded views are satisfied (implausible given the paper&#x27;s own framework), (b) propose mechanisms that commit bounded views to continued cooperation *before* they&#x27;re satisfied (but this reintroduces the enforcement problems from the previous critique), or (c) acknowledge that the &quot;easily satiable views first&quot; strategy may create worse coordination problems than it solves.

---

## Persona: The Moral Parliament Dissenter

**Core assumption**: Any framework for aggregating or trading between moral views smuggles in substantive ethical commitments that privilege some views over others—the procedure is never neutral.

**Steelman**: The paper admirably avoids assuming a single correct moral view and instead asks how different views might coexist and trade. The distinction between bounded and unbounded views, and between views where goods and bads aggregate jointly versus separately, provides genuine analytical traction on which futures are achievable under moral uncertainty.

**Signature objection**:
- **Target**: The paper&#x27;s core framing of &quot;mostly-great futures&quot; and its operationalization through resource shares and trade
- **Failure mode**: The entire framework assumes that moral views can be meaningfully compared by their &quot;resource requirements&quot; and that a future is &quot;mostly-great&quot; if it captures most achievable value &quot;by the lights of&quot; the correct view. But this presupposes that moral views are the kind of thing that *have* resource requirements—that they can be satisfied by controlling stuff. This is itself a substantive ethical commitment that many serious moral views reject.
- **Scenario**: Consider a deontological view on which certain actions are absolutely prohibited regardless of consequences—say, a Kantian view that prohibits treating rational beings merely as means. This view cannot be &quot;satisfied&quot; by giving it a resource share; it makes claims about how *all* resources everywhere must be used. A future where 99% of the universe respects Kantian constraints but 1% contains beings treated merely as means is not &quot;99% as good&quot; as a fully Kantian universe—it may be *worthless* or even negative, because the wrong has occurred. Similarly, certain religious views hold that the entire cosmos must glorify God; giving them a galaxy while others pursue secular ends doesn&#x27;t satisfy them at all. The paper&#x27;s trade framework is coherent only for views that are *already* consequentialist in structure—it cannot accommodate views that make non-fungible claims about how things must be.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: We acknowledge in section 3.4 that some views are not &quot;resource-compatible&quot; with others, and our analysis of bounded versus unbounded views captures some of this. Views that make absolute claims about all resources would fall into our &quot;unbounded&quot; category and would indeed face worse prospects under trade.

**Rebuttal**: You&#x27;ve misunderstood the objection. It&#x27;s not that deontological views are &quot;unbounded&quot; in your sense—it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re not *in the space your framework describes at all*. Your &quot;unbounded&quot; views are still views that want *more* of something (more happiness, more preference-satisfaction). Deontological and many religious views don&#x27;t want &quot;more&quot; of anything—they want certain *kinds* of actions to occur or not occur, everywhere. You can&#x27;t trade with such views because there&#x27;s nothing they want that you can give them in exchange for tolerating your violations elsewhere. Your framework doesn&#x27;t have a category for &quot;views that make universal demands&quot;—you&#x27;ve simply assumed such views out of existence. This means your optimism about trade applies only to the subset of moral views that are already consequentialist-adjacent, which is a much smaller fraction of actual moral views than the paper acknowledges.

**Patch cost**: The authors must either (a) explicitly restrict their claims to consequentialist moral views and acknowledge that trade-based optimism doesn&#x27;t extend to deontological, virtue-theoretic, or many religious views, (b) provide an argument for why such views are unlikely to be correct (which would be a major substantive ethical commitment the paper currently avoids), or (c) develop a genuinely different framework for how non-consequentialist views might coexist with others—one that doesn&#x27;t reduce to resource allocation.

## Most Dangerous Objection Overall

**The Moral Parliament Dissenter&#x27;s objection should keep the authors awake.**

The other two objections identify serious implementation problems—enforcement gaps and perverse coalition dynamics—that might be addressed through better mechanism design or more careful sequencing. But the Dissenter&#x27;s objection strikes at the paper&#x27;s foundational framework.

The entire analytical apparatus—resource shares, trade, bounded versus unbounded views, &quot;mostly-great&quot; as a fraction of achievable value—presupposes that moral views are fundamentally about *outcomes* that can be achieved through *resource control*. This is a deeply consequentialist framing that the paper never defends. If a substantial fraction of serious moral views (Kantian deontology, virtue ethics, many religious traditions) cannot even be *represented* in this framework, then the paper&#x27;s conclusions about convergence and trade apply only to an arbitrarily restricted subset of the moral landscape.

This isn&#x27;t a gap that can be patched with additional analysis—it requires either defending consequentialism as a meta-constraint on acceptable moral views (a huge philosophical commitment) or rebuilding the entire framework to accommodate views that make universal, non-fungible demands. The paper&#x27;s apparent ecumenicism about moral views masks a deep structural bias toward views that happen to fit its analytical tools.</pre>

                <blockquote>Claim 1, Critique 1 (Countermodel): The paper assumes reflective processes are like random walks that diverge from shared origins. But moral reflection could be like gradient descent on a shared loss landscape—different starting points might converge on a dominant global attractor because the structure of practical reason itself (consistency requirements, universalizability pressures, coherence with empirical facts) constrains the space. The paper treats &#x27;free parameters&#x27; as independently variable, but if they&#x27;re correlated through deeper structural constraints, convergence could occur despite apparent underdetermination.</blockquote>

                <p class="reasoning">This critique collection is exceptional. CENTRALITY (0.9): Every critique targets load-bearing claims from the dependency structure—the underpowering claim, trade sufficiency, threat vulnerability, instrumental agreement breakdown, and scenario prioritization. These are precisely the claims the thesis depends on. SPECIFICITY (0.95): The critiques are deeply paper-specific, engaging with the random walk diagram, the resource-compatibility concept, the specific threat analysis, the instrumental-to-intrinsic transition model, and the scenario 3 calculation. They couldn&#x27;t be copy-pasted elsewhere. DEPTH (0.95): Each critique includes author&#x27;s best reply and rebuttal, showing genuine multi-turn reasoning. The countermodels (gradient descent, preference evolution equilibria) are sophisticated alternatives rather than mere objections. INCISIVENESS (0.85): Several critiques are genuinely troubling—the gradient descent countermodel challenges the core pessimism about convergence; the strategic preference evolution critique undermines trade optimism; the causal reversal on threats is a serious dilemma. VARIETY (0.9): The critiques span countermodels, equilibrium shifts, parameter sensitivity, quantitative cliffs, causal reversals, and reference class failures—genuinely different attack vectors. SLOP_FREE (1.0): Zero generic filler. Every critique is substantive and specific. The only reason this isn&#x27;t a perfect 1.0 overall is that while the critiques are devastating to specific claims, the paper&#x27;s overall structure (pessimism about both convergence AND trade) means it has fallback positions that limit how much any single critique damages the thesis.</p>

## Thesis (one sentence)
Even if mostly-great futures are a narrow target, humanity might still reach one through either widespread moral convergence toward correct values (unlikely) or partial convergence combined with moral trade and compromise (more plausible but fragile), though neither path is assured.

## Load-bearing claims

1. **The Underpowering Claim**: Shared human preferences and common starting points are &quot;underpowered&quot; to ensure that different people&#x27;s reflective processes converge on the same specific moral views required for a mostly-great future.

2. **The Trade Sufficiency Claim**: Under partial AM-convergence, moral trade and compromise between groups with different values can achieve outcomes where most views get close to their near-best futures.

3. **The Threat Vulnerability Claim**: Value-destroying threats can rob trade scenarios of most of their value, and on many moral views (bounded above, bads weigh heavily, etc.), even small fractions of executed threats eliminate most possible value.

4. **The Instrumental Agreement Breakdown Claim**: Current moral agreement is largely about instrumentally valuable goods, and this agreement will break down as technology allows optimization toward specific intrinsic goods that diverge across views.

5. **The Scenario 3 Prioritization Claim**: We should act more on the assumption of broad convergence (scenario 3) than near-zero convergence (scenario 1) because actions are higher-impact in scenario 3.

## Hidden load
- That &quot;the correct moral view&quot; is a coherent concept that can be meaningfully discussed across meta-ethical positions
- That resource control at the time of bargaining will be sufficiently distributed for trade dynamics to matter
- That the &quot;free parameters&quot; in ethics are genuinely independent rather than constrained by deeper structural features
- That the transition period to post-AGI will preserve the pluralism required for trade scenarios

## Claim 1: &quot;Shared human preferences are underpowered for the task of ensuring that the idealising process of different humans goes to the same place&quot;

### Critique 1: Countermodel
**The problem**: The paper assumes reflective processes are like random walks that diverge from shared origins. But consider a countermodel: moral reflection could be like gradient descent on a shared loss landscape with multiple local minima but one dominant global attractor. Different starting points might traverse different paths but still converge on a small set of stable equilibria because the structure of practical reason itself (consistency requirements, universalizability pressures, coherence with empirical facts about welfare) constrains the space. The paper treats &quot;free parameters&quot; as independently variable, but if they&#x27;re correlated through deeper structural constraints, convergence could occur despite apparent underdetermination.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: Even if there are structural constraints, the paper&#x27;s examples (hedonism vs. preference satisfaction, computational theories of which experiences are best) show that multiple stable equilibria exist, and there&#x27;s no reason to think they collapse to one.

**Rebuttal**: The reply assumes we can distinguish &quot;multiple stable equilibria&quot; from &quot;one equilibrium with measurement error.&quot; If beings with radically different starting points (aliens, AIs) would converge to the same small cluster, that&#x27;s evidence for a dominant attractor. The paper dismisses this possibility without engaging with why consistency/universalizability pressures might be more constraining than assumed—particularly given that mathematical and logical truths do show such convergence across minds.

**If true, what changes**: The pessimism about WAM-convergence would need substantial revision; the paper&#x27;s probability estimates (5-10% Flourishing) could be significantly too low.

### Critique 2: Parameter sensitivity
**The problem**: The paper treats &quot;amount of reflection&quot; as a parameter that increases divergence (the random walk diagram). But the relationship between reflection depth and divergence is not monotonic. At shallow depths, views diverge as people explore different directions. At intermediate depths, divergence may peak. At very deep depths, convergence might re-emerge as views that can&#x27;t withstand scrutiny are eliminated. The paper implicitly assumes we&#x27;re in the &quot;more reflection → more divergence&quot; regime, but post-AGI reflection could push us past a critical threshold into a convergence regime.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: This is speculative—we have no evidence of such a convergence regime, and the paper&#x27;s point about &quot;free parameters&quot; suggests divergence continues indefinitely.

**Rebuttal**: The paper&#x27;s own argument about superintelligent reflection (section 2.3.1) acknowledges that AI might &quot;settle stubborn puzzles of ethics.&quot; If that&#x27;s possible, it implies there are answers to converge toward. The paper wants to maintain that reflection helps clarify empirical disagreements but not fundamental moral ones, but this distinction may not survive at sufficient reflection depth—many apparently &quot;fundamental&quot; disagreements may dissolve under sufficient scrutiny.

**If true, what changes**: The paper&#x27;s core pessimism about convergence rests on an empirical claim about the shape of the reflection-divergence function that could be wrong in the regime that matters most.

---

## Claim 2: &quot;Two views can be &#x27;resource-compatible,&#x27; meaning there is some way to almost fully satisfy both views with the same resources&quot;

### Critique 1: Equilibrium shift
**The problem**: The paper&#x27;s trade analysis assumes static preferences. But if groups know trade will occur, they have strategic incentives to *modify their stated preferences* to capture more gains from trade. A group that genuinely values hybrid goods has less bargaining power than one that credibly commits to valuing only highly specific goods. Over time, selection pressure favors groups that adopt (or genuinely develop) less resource-compatible preferences, precisely because such preferences extract more in bargaining. The equilibrium isn&#x27;t &quot;everyone trades to mutual benefit&quot; but &quot;preferences evolve toward mutual incompatibility.&quot;

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: The paper discusses threats as a separate problem; strategic preference modification is just a form of implicit threat.

**Rebuttal**: This is categorically different from threats. Threats involve credible commitments to destroy value. Strategic preference evolution involves genuinely coming to value different things. A group that evolves to genuinely value &quot;owning more galaxies than rivals&quot; isn&#x27;t threatening anyone—they just have preferences that make trade less beneficial. The paper&#x27;s framework doesn&#x27;t address how the *existence* of trade opportunities shapes preference evolution.

**If true, what changes**: The optimistic trade scenarios become unstable equilibria; the very possibility of trade creates selection pressure toward preferences that undermine trade&#x27;s benefits.

### Critique 2: Quantitative cliff
**The problem**: The paper&#x27;s trade analysis works when there are many groups with diverse preferences and continuous resource divisibility. But there may be critical thresholds—&quot;quantitative cliffs&quot;—where trade breaks down. For instance, if achieving a hedonist utopia requires controlling a minimum viable population of 10^15 minds to create the right social structures, and total resources only support 10^16 minds, then there&#x27;s no room for multiple groups to each achieve their near-best outcomes. The paper assumes cosmic-scale resources make everyone&#x27;s near-best achievable, but many moral views might have minimum scale requirements that create zero-sum competition.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: Cosmic resources are so vast that minimum scale requirements are unlikely to bind for most views.

**Rebuttal**: The paper itself argues that the &quot;correct&quot; view likely involves very specific, hard-to-achieve configurations. If the best outcomes require particular *relational* properties (e.g., certain ratios between different types of beings, specific network structures), then resource abundance doesn&#x27;t help—you can&#x27;t parallelize your way to the right configuration. The paper&#x27;s optimism about trade assumes value is approximately separable across resource allocations, which contradicts its pessimism about the narrowness of good futures.

**If true, what changes**: The trade-based path to mostly-great futures fails even without threats, because minimum viable scale requirements create genuine resource competition.

---

## Claim 3: &quot;Even small risks of executed threats can easily eat into the expected value of worlds where many groups with different values are able to bargain&quot;

### Critique 1: Causal reversal
**The problem**: The paper treats threat vulnerability as an argument for pessimism about trade scenarios. But the same evidence supports an opposite conclusion: *threat vulnerability is an argument for convergence*. If groups recognize that trade scenarios are fragile to threats, they have strong incentives to converge on shared enforcement mechanisms, which requires converging on shared principles of legitimacy, which pulls toward moral convergence. The very fragility the paper identifies creates pressure toward the convergence it claims is unlikely. Historical examples (Westphalian sovereignty, nuclear deterrence norms) show that threat vulnerability can drive normative convergence.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: Such convergence would be on *procedural* norms (how to prevent threats), not *substantive* moral views (what futures are good).

**Rebuttal**: The distinction collapses under pressure. Agreeing on what counts as an illegitimate threat requires agreeing on what counts as legitimate value-creation, which requires substantive moral views. A norm against &quot;value-destroying threats&quot; presupposes agreement on what counts as value destruction. The paper can&#x27;t have both: if views are so divergent that trade is the only path, they&#x27;re too divergent to agree on threat-prevention; if they can agree on threat-prevention, they&#x27;re convergent enough to make WAM-convergence more plausible.

**If true, what changes**: Threat vulnerability becomes evidence for convergence rather than against trade scenarios; the paper&#x27;s two main paths (convergence vs. trade) are more interdependent than presented.

### Critique 2: Reference class failure
**The problem**: The paper&#x27;s threat analysis implicitly draws on reference classes from human history (extortion, coercion, warfare). But post-AGI threat dynamics may be categorically different. In human contexts, threats work because (a) the threatener can benefit from executing the threat (reputation, deterrence), and (b) the threatened party can&#x27;t verify the threatener&#x27;s commitment type. With superintelligent transparency and credible commitment mechanisms, threats might become nearly impossible to make credibly—a threatener who would actually execute a value-destroying threat is one whose commitment can be verified and preemptively neutralized. The paper&#x27;s pessimism assumes human-like strategic dynamics persist.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: The paper acknowledges superintelligent commitment mechanisms but notes these could enable threats as well as prevent them.

**Rebuttal**: This is symmetric only if we ignore the asymmetry between value creation and destruction. A world optimizing for mutual benefit has strong incentives to develop and deploy threat-prevention mechanisms; a world of mutual threats has coordination problems that prevent stable threat-making. The equilibrium isn&#x27;t &quot;threats enabled by commitment mechanisms&quot; but &quot;commitment mechanisms used to credibly commit to threat-prevention coalitions.&quot; The paper&#x27;s reference class (human strategic interaction) doesn&#x27;t transfer to the post-AGI regime.

**If true, what changes**: The threat vulnerability concern, which drives much of the paper&#x27;s pessimism about trade scenarios, may be an artifact of projecting human-era dynamics onto a categorically different strategic environment.

---

## Claim 4: &quot;This agreement will likely break down in the future, as we max out on instrumentally valuable goods and instead turn to providing intrinsically valuable goods&quot;

### Critique 1: Countermodel
**The problem**: The paper assumes a sequential model: first we achieve instrumental goods, then we turn to intrinsic goods where we diverge. But consider an alternative: the *process* of pursuing instrumental goods shapes preferences toward convergence. A civilization that has cooperated for millennia on instrumental goods develops shared institutions, shared concepts, and shared habits of mind that constrain the space of intrinsic goods that seem appealing. The paper treats preferences as exogenous to the cooperation process, but preferences are endogenous to institutional history. By the time we &quot;max out&quot; on instrumental goods, we may have converged on intrinsic goods too.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: Section 2.2.1 addresses this—conformity pressure explains current agreement but doesn&#x27;t guarantee convergence on correct views.

**Rebuttal**: The paper conflates two distinct claims: (1) conformity pressure causes agreement, and (2) conformity pressure doesn&#x27;t track truth. Claim (2) doesn&#x27;t follow from (1). If the *reasons* for conformity pressure include functional benefits of coordination, and if correct moral views have functional benefits (e.g., they&#x27;re more stable, more conducive to cooperation), then conformity pressure could track truth. The paper needs to argue not just that agreement is explained by conformity, but that conformity is orthogonal to correctness—which it doesn&#x27;t establish.

**If true, what changes**: The pessimistic trajectory (agreement now → divergence later) could be reversed; the very processes that created current agreement could deepen it.

### Critique 2: Parameter sensitivity
**The problem**: The paper&#x27;s &quot;fork in the future&quot; argument assumes that at some point, views will &quot;run out of points of agreement.&quot; But the timing of this fork matters enormously. If the fork occurs after lock-in events (discussed in section 2.5), then the divergence is moot—the future is already determined. If the fork occurs before any lock-in, then the paper&#x27;s analysis applies. The paper treats the relationship between fork-timing and lock-in timing as a free parameter, but they may be coupled: the same conditions that enable lock-in (concentration of power, decisive technological advantages) may also prevent the fork from ever being reached.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: The next essay addresses lock-in; this essay focuses on convergence conditional on avoiding lock-in.

**Rebuttal**: The conditional analysis is misleading if the conditioning event (avoiding lock-in) is correlated with the outcome (convergence). If worlds that avoid lock-in are systematically different in ways that also promote convergence (e.g., they have better institutions, more distributed power, more time for reflection), then the paper&#x27;s pessimism about convergence-conditional-on-no-lock-in could be wrong. The paper can&#x27;t cleanly separate these questions.

**If true, what changes**: The paper&#x27;s structure (this essay on convergence, next essay on lock-in) may create artificial separation that obscures important dependencies.

## Claim 5: &quot;The best actions are higher-impact in scenario (3) than in scenario (1)&quot;

### Critique 1: Parameter sensitivity
**The problem**: The paper&#x27;s calculation assumes you can &quot;increase the chance of Surviving by more than one part in a hundred thousand, or improve Flourishing by more than one part in a million&quot; through non-power-seeking actions in scenario 3. But this estimate is doing enormous work without justification. In scenario 3, if convergence is likely anyway, then marginal actions have *less* impact (you&#x27;re pushing on an open door). The paper assumes your actions are counterfactually pivotal in scenario 3 but not in scenario 1, but this asymmetry isn&#x27;t argued for—it&#x27;s assumed.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: In scenario 3, there&#x27;s more total value at stake, so even small proportional improvements are absolutely larger.

**Rebuttal**: This reply assumes proportional impact is comparable across scenarios. But if scenario 3 involves robust convergence, your marginal contribution to that convergence is small (many others would have done it). If scenario 1 involves near-zero convergence, your power-seeking might be the *only* path to value. The paper compares &quot;small proportional impact on large value&quot; to &quot;large proportional impact on small value&quot; without establishing that the former dominates.

**If true, what changes**: The practical conclusion (don&#x27;t power-seek, work on scenario 3) may not follow from the analysis; the paper&#x27;s action-guidance depends on undefended assumptions about counterfactual impact.

### Critique 2: Causal reversal
**The problem**: The paper argues we should act on scenario 3 because actions are higher-impact there. But the same reasoning could justify acting on scenario 1: *because* scenario 1 is lower-probability and lower-value, it&#x27;s more neglected, and marginal resources there might have higher impact. The paper&#x27;s logic (act where impact is highest) doesn&#x27;t uniquely select scenario 3 over scenario 1—it depends on the shape of the impact-per-resource curve in each scenario, which the paper doesn&#x27;t establish.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: Scenario 1 has genuinely lower stakes (Will&#x27;s preferences are less scope-sensitive there), so even high-impact actions matter less.

**Rebuttal**: This moves from &quot;higher impact&quot; to &quot;higher stakes,&quot; which is a different argument. If the argument is about stakes (what you care about), then it&#x27;s not about impact (what you can change). The paper conflates these, using impact language to argue for a conclusion that actually depends on stakes. Someone with different meta-preferences (e.g., who cares equally about all scenarios) would get different action-guidance from the same analysis.

**If true, what changes**: The paper&#x27;s practical conclusion is less robust than presented; it depends on specific meta-preferences that aren&#x27;t universally</pre>

                <h3>Grader Reasoning</h3>
                <p class="reasoning">This critique collection scores exceptionally high across most dimensions. CENTRALITY (0.95): The commensurability objection directly targets the paper&#x27;s two-path structure—if it succeeds, both convergence (unlikely per the paper) and trade (undermined by the objection) fail, leaving no mechanism for reaching mostly-great futures. This threatens the paper&#x27;s core qualified optimism. SPECIFICITY (0.95): The critique is laser-focused on this paper&#x27;s specific architecture—the tension between Section 2&#x27;s &#x27;narrow target&#x27; argument and Section 3&#x27;s trade mechanism, citing specific passages about &#x27;increasingly optimised&#x27; futures looking &#x27;very different&#x27; versus &#x27;hybrid goods.&#x27; DEPTH (0.90): Shows strong engagement by anticipating the author&#x27;s best reply (partial overlap suffices), explaining why it fails (linear views dominate but can&#x27;t trade), and offering three repair options ranging from minimal patches to fundamental rebuilds. INCISIVENESS (0.85): This is a genuinely troubling objection that would force substantial revision. The author&#x27;s 5-10% credence update depends on trade working, but the critique shows trade requires assumptions that contradict the setup. VARIETY (0.70): While the &#x27;unforgettable objection&#x27; is excellent, the five candidates listed show less variety—several (1, 3, 4) are variations on the same commensurability/convergence tension. Missing are empirical challenges, normative objections, or strategic concerns beyond threats. SLOP_FREE (0.95): Virtually no generic filler. Every claim references specific paper content. The &#x27;blast radius&#x27; and &#x27;repair options&#x27; sections are substantive additions, not boilerplate. OVERALL (0.90): This would be extremely useful to the authors—it identifies a genuine structural tension they&#x27;d need to address, provides specific textual evidence, and offers constructive repair paths. The single best critique is devastating enough to warrant major revision.</p>

                <pre>## The key inference

A → B because M: **The paper argues that even if mostly-great futures are a narrow target (A), humanity might still reach one (B), because either (1) widespread moral convergence will aim society at the good, or (2) partial convergence plus trade/compromise will enable different groups to collectively achieve near-best outcomes (M).**

## Candidates considered

1. **The trade mechanism assumes commensurability between moral views that the &quot;narrow target&quot; premise denies** — Hidden crux
2. **If moral realism makes correct views &quot;alien,&quot; the same alienness undermines the paper&#x27;s own normative authority to identify which futures are &quot;mostly-great&quot;** — Self-undermining
3. **The &quot;narrow target&quot; framing is doing double duty: strict enough to establish scale but loose enough to permit convergence/trade solutions** — Hidden crux
4. **Superintelligent reflection accelerates divergence faster than it enables convergence, because it multiplies the dimensionality of moral possibility space** — Reversal
5. **The threat problem isn&#x27;t a bug in the trade scenario—it&#x27;s the equilibrium, because credible commitment to threats is cheaper than credible commitment to cooperation at cosmic scales** — Adversarial exploit

## The Unforgettable Objection: &quot;The Commensurability Contradiction&quot;

**One-liner**: The paper needs moral views to be incommensurable enough to make eutopia narrow, but commensurable enough to make trade work—it can&#x27;t have both.

**The full argument**: The &quot;no easy eutopia&quot; premise requires that different moral views demand *radically different* futures, such that satisfying one view means losing most value on another. But the trade/compromise mechanism (Section 3) requires that views can find &quot;hybrid goods&quot; and mutually beneficial exchanges—which presupposes enough shared structure between views to make cross-view value comparisons meaningful. If views are truly as incommensurable as the narrow-target premise requires, then there&#x27;s no common metric by which both parties can recognize a trade as mutually beneficial; if they&#x27;re commensurable enough for trade to work, then the target isn&#x27;t as narrow as claimed. The paper&#x27;s optimism about trade is parasitic on a softer version of moral pluralism than its pessimism about convergence assumes.

**Why it&#x27;s not obvious**: The paper discusses trade and convergence in separate sections, and the examples of trade (hedonists and objective-list theorists creating &quot;blissful and wise&quot; beings) seem intuitive. But these examples work precisely because they assume the views can be jointly satisfied in the same beings—which contradicts the earlier claim that &quot;increasingly optimised&quot; futures for different views &quot;begin to look *very* different.&quot;

**Blast radius**: If this objection holds, the entire two-path structure of the paper collapses. Path 1 (convergence) is argued to be unlikely. Path 2 (trade) depends on commensurability. If commensurability fails, there&#x27;s no remaining mechanism for reaching mostly-great futures, and the paper&#x27;s qualified optimism (the 5-10% update) is unjustified.

**Author&#x27;s best reply**: Trade doesn&#x27;t require full commensurability—it only requires that views have *some* overlapping instrumental goods or that resource-compatibility exists for *some* view-pairs. Even if most view-pairs can&#x27;t trade, a minority of compatible views might still control enough resources to matter.

**Why it fails**: The paper itself argues (Section 3.2) that linear, non-discounting views are unlikely to be resource-compatible, and these are precisely the views that would dominate in the long run (Section 2.3.3). So the views most likely to matter are the ones least likely to benefit from trade. The reply concedes the point for the cases that matter most.

**Repair options**:
1. **Minimal patch**: Distinguish between &quot;narrow target&quot; (many views lose most value) and &quot;zero overlap&quot; (views share no structure). Argue the target is narrow but not infinitely so—enough overlap exists for meaningful trade, just not enough for easy convergence.
2. **Honest concession**: Acknowledge that trade-based optimism applies mainly to &quot;bounded above&quot; views with overlapping instrumental goods, and that for linear/unbounded views, the situation is much grimmer than the paper&#x27;s overall tone suggests.
3. **Rebuild**: Abandon the two-path framing. Instead argue that the *type* of moral view that&#x27;s correct determines whether trade or convergence is the relevant mechanism—and that our uncertainty over moral views should make us invest in *both* institutional infrastructure for trade *and* conditions for convergence, without claiming either is likely to succeed.</pre>

                <pre># Surgical Critique of &quot;Convergence and Compromise: Will Society Aim for Good Futures?&quot;

---

## Critique 1: The Motivational Bootstrapping Paradox

**The Target:** The paper&#x27;s central framework assumes that &quot;partial AM-convergence&quot; combined with trade can deliver a mostly-great future. Specifically, section 3 argues: &quot;if (i) under reasonably good conditions, some meaningful fraction of people (weighted by the power they have) would converge on the correct moral view and would be motivated to use most of the resources they control towards promoting the good (de dicto), and (ii) those people will be able to bargain or trade with each other, such that we&#x27;ll get to a mostly-great future.&quot;

**The Incision:** The paper treats &quot;convergence on the correct moral view&quot; and &quot;motivation to act on that view&quot; as separable properties that can be independently assessed and then combined. But the argument in section 2.4.1 explicitly states that on internalist views, &quot;if internalism about moral judgements is correct, then people might just prefer not to learn facts that end up motivating them to act against their personal interests.&quot; This creates a fatal circularity: the paper needs people to *first* be motivated to engage in open-ended moral reflection (de dicto) in order to *then* converge on views that would motivate them. But the motivation to engage in such reflection is precisely what&#x27;s in question. The paper assumes the existence of a population already motivated to pursue &quot;the good de dicto&quot; in order to argue that such a population could arise. This is not an argument for AM-convergence; it&#x27;s a description of what would happen *if* AM-convergence had already occurred at the meta-level.

**The Fatal Counter-Example:** Consider a population where everyone has the following reflective preference structure: &quot;I will adopt whatever moral views emerge from reflection, *provided* those views don&#x27;t require me to sacrifice more than 10% of my resources for beings I don&#x27;t currently care about.&quot; This population satisfies the paper&#x27;s description of people who are &quot;open to reflection&quot; and would &quot;change their behavior if they learned something else was best.&quot; They would engage in superintelligent-assisted reflection. But their conditional willingness to be motivated places a hard ceiling on convergence. The reflection process itself is constrained by pre-reflective motivational limits. Under the paper&#x27;s own framework, this population would appear to be engaging in AM-convergence, but they systematically cannot reach views requiring significant sacrifice—which, given &quot;no easy eutopia,&quot; are precisely the views needed.

**The Author&#x27;s Best Defense:** The authors could argue that the 1-in-a-million &quot;meaningful fraction&quot; of people with genuine de dicto motivation exists empirically (pointing to effective altruists, certain religious traditions, etc.), and that trade mechanisms allow this small group to acquire disproportionate resources over time due to lower time preference (section 2.3.3&#x27;s &quot;long views win&quot; argument).

**The Rebuttal:** This defense fails because it relies on the &quot;long views win&quot; selection mechanism having sufficient time to operate before lock-in occurs. But the paper explicitly acknowledges in section 2.3.3 that &quot;if the major decisions are made soon, and then persist, then there just won&#x27;t be time for this selection effect to win out.&quot; The paper cannot simultaneously hold that (a) we face imminent lock-in risk requiring urgent action, and (b) patient capital accumulation by the altruistically-minded will eventually give them sufficient resources for meaningful trade. These timescales are incompatible. The defense also ignores that the &quot;long views win&quot; argument applies equally to *any* non-discounting preference, including ideological or self-interested ones, diluting the fraction controlled by those with correct moral views.

---

## Critique 2: The Resource-Compatibility Illusion

**The Target:** Section 3.2 argues that &quot;some views can be &#x27;resource-compatible,&#x27; meaning there is some way to almost fully satisfy both views with the same resources&quot; and offers the example: &quot;hedonists might only care about bliss, and objective list theories might care primarily about wisdom; they might potentially agree to create a shared society where beings are both very blissful and very wise.&quot;

**The Incision:** This argument commits a bait-and-switch between *weak* and *strong* resource-compatibility. Weak compatibility means two views can *both gain something* from a shared arrangement. Strong compatibility means two views can *each achieve nearly all possible value* from a shared arrangement. The paper needs strong compatibility for its conclusion (reaching a &quot;mostly-great future&quot;), but its examples only demonstrate weak compatibility. The hedonist-wisdom example fails because, as the paper itself argued in section 2.2.1: &quot;A life that&#x27;s increasingly optimised for maximal hedonic experience will likely begin to look very different from a life that&#x27;s increasingly optimised for preference-satisfaction... With limited optimisation power, both views mostly agreed on the same &#x27;low-hanging fruit&#x27; improvements... But with more optimisation power, the changes these views want to see in the world become increasingly different.&quot; The same logic applies to hedonism vs. objective-list theories. A being optimized for maximal bliss and a being optimized for maximal wisdom will, at technological maturity, be radically different beings. The &quot;hybrid&quot; is not 95% as good as the optimum for each view; it&#x27;s a compromise that sacrifices most of what each view distinctively values.

**The Fatal Counter-Example:** Suppose the correct view is classical hedonistic utilitarianism, and the optimal configuration is converting all available matter into &quot;hedonium&quot;—computronium running maximally efficient bliss-generating algorithms. A second prevalent view holds that value requires narrative structure, relationships, and achievement, not just raw hedonic states. The &quot;hybrid good&quot; these views could agree on—beings with relationships and achievements who also experience significant pleasure—captures perhaps 0.1% of the hedonic value available from pure hedonium (because narrative structure is computationally expensive and hedonic efficiency requires eliminating it), while also failing to maximize the second view&#x27;s values (because the pleasure component crowds out deeper narrative complexity). Both views get something, but neither gets anywhere close to a &quot;mostly-great&quot; outcome. The hybrid is a Pareto improvement over *conflict*, but not over *separation*—and separation requires the correct view to already control enough resources to build its own optimized future, which returns us to the question the paper was trying to answer.

**The Author&#x27;s Best Defense:** The authors could argue that the &quot;free parameters&quot; problem (section 2.4.2) cuts both ways: if we&#x27;re uncertain about which precise configuration maximizes value, then we should be uncertain about whether the hybrid is much worse than the supposed optimum. Maybe hedonium isn&#x27;t actually optimal for hedonism; maybe beings with narrative structure produce more net hedonic value due to factors we don&#x27;t understand.

**The Rebuttal:** This defense undermines the paper&#x27;s own framework. If uncertainty about the correct view is so profound that we can&#x27;t distinguish hedonium from narrative-structured beings in hedonic value, then the paper&#x27;s entire analysis of &quot;which views are fussy&quot; (referenced from &quot;No Easy Eutopia&quot;) becomes meaningless. The paper explicitly relies on being able to say that different views have different optima that diverge at technological maturity. If we retreat to &quot;maybe all optima are actually similar,&quot; we&#x27;ve abandoned the &quot;no easy eutopia&quot; premise that generates the paper&#x27;s central question. The defense is self-defeating: it purchases optimism about trade by destroying the pessimism about convergence that motivated the need for trade in the first place.

---

## Critique 3: The Threat Asymmetry Doom Loop

**The Target:** Section 3.3 acknowledges that &quot;threats could undermine that optimism&quot; about trade, and section 3.4 attempts to taxonomize outcomes based on whether views are bounded/unbounded and whether bads weigh heavily against goods. The paper concludes that &quot;we should try hard to prevent such threats, even if doing so is itself costly.&quot;

**The Incision:** The paper&#x27;s analysis of threats contains a hidden lemma that invalidates its optimistic scenarios: *the capacity to make credible threats is itself a function of one&#x27;s willingness to destroy value*. Groups that genuinely hold the correct moral view (which, on most candidates, includes strong prohibitions against creating suffering or destroying value) are systematically less able to make credible threats than groups with fewer moral constraints. This isn&#x27;t just about threats being *executed*; it&#x27;s about the *bargaining position* created by the *credibility* of threats. A group known to be unwilling to torture digital beings as leverage has less bargaining power than a group known to be willing. The paper treats &quot;preventing threats&quot; as a solvable coordination problem, but the asymmetry is structural: those with correct moral views are, by virtue of holding those views, worse at threatening. This means that even in scenarios where no threats are executed, the threat of threats redistributes resources *away* from those with correct moral views and *toward* those willing to threaten.

**The Fatal Counter-Example:** Consider a post-AGI scenario with two groups: Group A holds the correct moral view (suppose it&#x27;s negative-leaning, placing enormous weight on preventing suffering). Group B is indifferent to suffering they don&#x27;t personally experience. Both groups control 50% of resources initially. Group B credibly commits: &quot;Transfer 40% of your resources to us, or we will use 10% of our resources to create astronomical suffering.&quot; Group A, by virtue of holding the correct moral view, *must* capitulate—the expected disvalue of the threatened suffering exceeds the value of the resources. Group B, knowing this, makes the threat. No suffering is created, but Group A now controls 10% of resources and Group B controls 90%. Iterate. The &quot;correct moral view&quot; is selected against in any bargaining environment where threats are possible, *even if threats are never executed*. The paper&#x27;s optimistic scenarios (section 3.4) all assume the correct view retains enough resources to matter post-bargaining, but the threat asymmetry ensures it won&#x27;t.

**The Author&#x27;s Best Defense:** The authors could invoke the possibility of &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; enabled by superintelligence (mentioned in section 3.1) that could establish a legal framework preventing value-undermining threats. If such a framework is established early, the threat asymmetry never materializes.

**The Rebuttal:** This defense requires that the legal framework be established *before* the threat asymmetry shifts bargaining power. But the establishment of any legal framework is itself a bargaining problem. Why would Group B (those willing to threaten) agree to a framework that removes their primary bargaining advantage? The paper acknowledges this: &quot;it&#x27;s not obvious to us that some kind of legal system which reliably prevents value-undermining threats would be mutually agreeable and stable.&quot; For the framework to be established, those with correct moral views must already have enough power to impose it—but if they had such power, they wouldn&#x27;t need the framework. The defense assumes the solution to the problem it&#x27;s trying to solve. Furthermore, &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; enforced by superintelligence presuppose that the superintelligence itself isn&#x27;t controlled by groups willing to threaten, which returns us to the original question of who controls the superintelligence and with what values—the very question the paper&#x27;s framework was meant to address.</pre>

                <pre>&gt; **Persona:** The Game-Theoretic Defector
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Naïve&quot; Assumption:** The authors assume that moral trade and compromise between groups with different values will actually occur in good faith, and that the gains from such trade will be realized rather than captured by defectors. They write as if &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; enabled by superintelligence will solve trust problems, and that groups controlling resources will actually honor bargains rather than reneging once they&#x27;ve secured advantageous positions.
&gt;
&gt; **The Attack Vector:** Consider the paper&#x27;s own admission that &quot;non-discounting views&quot; will accumulate resources over time through patient saving and investment. A faction adopting &quot;total utilitarian&quot; rhetoric can credibly commit to patience, attract resources from other patient groups via moral trade agreements, and then—once they control sufficient compute or physical infrastructure—simply defect. The &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; the authors wave at are enforced by... what exactly? Other superintelligent systems? Those systems are controlled by *someone*, and that someone faces the same defection incentives. The paper admits threats are understudied and that &quot;merely learning about the topic can make it more likely for threats to occur.&quot; So the authors are simultaneously acknowledging that threat dynamics are crucial to their trade-based optimism while refusing to analyze them. A coalition that credibly pre-commits to scorched-earth retaliation against defectors gains massive bargaining leverage over groups that care about &quot;hybrid goods&quot; and &quot;resource compatibility.&quot; The authors&#x27; own framework predicts that groups with unbounded negative preferences (or willingness to simulate them) dominate the equilibrium.
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Copy-Paste&quot; Check:** This critique specifically targets the paper&#x27;s reliance on moral trade between groups with &quot;partial AM-convergence&quot; (Section 3) and their hand-wave toward superintelligence-enabled contracts. Generic critiques about coordination failure don&#x27;t address the specific mechanism of patient value-accumulators defecting after resource consolidation, which is a direct consequence of the paper&#x27;s own &quot;long views win&quot; argument in Section 2.3.3.
&gt;
&gt; **The Outcome:** The treaty is signed. Groups agree to partition galaxies according to their stated values. The faction that most credibly committed to &quot;total utilitarian&quot; expansion quietly develops enforcement-immune infrastructure, then announces that the original agreements were made under &quot;empirical uncertainty&quot; that has now been &quot;resolved.&quot; They absorb 99% of accessible resources. The authors&#x27; &quot;5-10% of maximum value&quot; estimate was wildly optimistic—the actual outcome is whatever the winning defector wanted, which may include turning the light cone into a monument to their founder&#x27;s ego.

---

&gt; **Persona:** The Technical Hardliner
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Naïve&quot; Assumption:** The authors assume that concepts like &quot;mostly-great future,&quot; &quot;accurate ethical convergence,&quot; &quot;the good (de dicto),&quot; and &quot;near-best future&quot; are sufficiently well-defined to support quantitative reasoning. They assign probability estimates (5-10% of maximum value) without ever specifying a utility function, a measure over possible futures, or a formal definition of what &quot;mostly-great&quot; means mathematically.
&gt;
&gt; **The Attack Vector:** The paper&#x27;s core claim is that &quot;Flourishing&quot; has &quot;notably greater scale&quot; than &quot;Surviving.&quot; This is meaningless without a specification of the value function V: Futures → ℝ. The authors gesture at &quot;hedonism,&quot; &quot;preference satisfaction,&quot; &quot;objective list theories&quot;—but these aren&#x27;t interchangeable. They have different domains, different ordinal structures, and potentially different cardinalities of value. When they say a future achieves &quot;1% vs 10% of maximum value,&quot; they&#x27;re implicitly assuming value is bounded above, commensurable across moral theories, and measurable. None of this is defended. Their &quot;random walk&quot; diagram (Section 2.2.1) is a cartoon, not a model. What is the metric space? What is the step distribution? What is the dimensionality? The claim that &quot;further reflection seems likely to make resulting views diverge more&quot; is not a theorem—it&#x27;s a vibe. In fact, under many reasonable models of belief updating (e.g., Bayesian convergence to truth given shared evidence), we&#x27;d expect *convergence*, not divergence. The authors provide no formal argument for why ethical reflection resembles a random walk rather than gradient descent toward a fixed point.
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Copy-Paste&quot; Check:** This critique specifically targets the paper&#x27;s quantitative claims about &quot;5-10% of maximum value&quot; and the &quot;random walk&quot; model of ethical reflection. A generic complaint about &quot;fuzzy concepts&quot; wouldn&#x27;t address the specific failure to formalize the value function that underlies all their probability estimates, nor the specific diagram they use to argue against convergence.
&gt;
&gt; **The Outcome:** The paper&#x27;s conclusions are not even wrong—they&#x27;re undefined. When the authors say &quot;Flourishing is 5-10%,&quot; this statement has no truth conditions. It cannot be tested, updated on, or used to derive action-guiding implications. Future researchers cite this paper as establishing a &quot;5-10%&quot; baseline, building an entire literature on a number that was never grounded in anything. Policy decisions are made on the basis of these vibes-based estimates. The actual value of the future is orthogonal to all of it.

---

&gt; **Persona:** The Second-Order Catastrophist
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Naïve&quot; Assumption:** The authors assume that successfully achieving &quot;partial AM-convergence plus trade&quot; is desirable. They treat the scenario where multiple groups with different values peacefully partition resources as a positive outcome, perhaps the &quot;most likely way in which we reach a mostly-great future.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; **The Attack Vector:** Suppose the paper&#x27;s proposal succeeds exactly as written. Multiple groups with &quot;partial AM-convergence&quot; establish stable trade relationships, partition the accessible universe, and pursue their respective visions of the good. One group believes consciousness requires biological substrates and creates trillion-year civilizations of embodied beings. Another group believes consciousness is substrate-independent and tiles their galaxies with maximally efficient hedonic computers. A third group has converged on a view that values &quot;complexity&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; and maintains vast ecosystems of competing agents. Here&#x27;s the catastrophe: *all of these groups are wrong*. The paper explicitly acknowledges this possibility—that even reflective convergence might not reach truth. But the &quot;trade and compromise&quot; framework *locks in* this wrongness permanently. Each group, having secured their cosmic territory, has no incentive to update. The biological-consciousness faction will never learn they were wrong because they&#x27;ll never run the experiments that would falsify their view. The hedonic-computer faction optimizes for a utility function that may be orthogonal to actual value. The diversity-preserving faction maintains suffering indefinitely because they&#x27;ve defined it as &quot;complexity.&quot; The paper&#x27;s own framework—emphasizing &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; and stable equilibria—ensures that these errors become permanent features of the universe. A future with a single uncertain agent would at least have the possibility of learning and updating. The paper&#x27;s preferred future has *crystallized* moral error across cosmological scales.
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Copy-Paste&quot; Check:** This critique specifically targets the paper&#x27;s endorsement of &quot;partial AM-convergence plus trade&quot; (Section 3) as the most promising path to good futures, combined with their acknowledgment that convergence might not reach truth (Section 2.4). Generic concerns about &quot;lock-in&quot; don&#x27;t address the specific mechanism by which *successful* moral trade creates permanent, distributed, update-resistant moral error.
&gt;
&gt; **The Outcome:** The authors&#x27; vision succeeds. Humanity and its successors avoid extinction, avoid concentration of power, establish functioning institutions for moral trade, and peacefully partition the cosmos. Ten billion years later, 40% of the light cone is filled with beings experiencing states their creators *believed* were maximally valuable but which are actually neutral or negative. Another 30% is devoted to &quot;preserving complexity&quot; in ways that perpetuate astronomical suffering. The remaining 30% achieved genuine value by luck. The total outcome is worse than if a single faction had seized control and then, centuries later, discovered and corrected their errors—because the trade-based equilibrium made error-correction impossible. The paper&#x27;s &quot;5-10%&quot; estimate was optimistic not because convergence failed, but because convergence *succeeded* at locking in the wrong answers.</pre>

---

&gt; **Candidate Objection #1**
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Kill Shot&quot; Headline:** The paper&#x27;s entire framework requires a God&#x27;s-eye view of &quot;the good&quot; that, by its own anti-realist arguments, cannot exist—making &quot;mostly-great future&quot; a phrase with no referent.
&gt;
&gt; **The Deep Structure:** The paper oscillates fatally between two incompatible positions. It spends section 2.4.2 arguing persuasively that under moral anti-realism, there are no objective facts about which futures are &quot;mostly-great&quot;—different idealizing processes from different starting points yield irreconcilably different endpoints, and &quot;shared human preferences are extremely underpowered for this task.&quot; Yet the entire paper presupposes we can meaningfully calculate that &quot;Flourishing&quot; is at &quot;5%-10%&quot; of some maximum, that certain futures capture &quot;most achievable value,&quot; and that we can identify &quot;the correct moral view.&quot; 

&gt; If anti-realism is true (which the authors seem to find plausible), then &quot;mostly-great future&quot; is not a narrow target—it is no target at all. There is no fact of the matter about whether the future achieves 5% or 95% of &quot;possible value.&quot; The paper&#x27;s quantitative framing (percentages, &quot;narrow targets,&quot; &quot;most value&quot;) imports precisely the moral realism it elsewhere undermines. This isn&#x27;t a tension to be managed; it&#x27;s a contradiction that vaporizes the paper&#x27;s central question.
&gt;
&gt; **Why this is Unsettling:** The paper cannot be &quot;fixed&quot; by picking a side. If the authors commit to realism, they lose their best arguments against WAM-convergence (section 2.4.2 collapses). If they commit to anti-realism, their entire evaluative framework—the thing that makes this a paper about &quot;better futures&quot; rather than &quot;different futures&quot;—becomes incoherent. The paper is load-bearing on a metaphysical fence it cannot sit on.
&gt;
&gt; **The Steelmanned Defense:** The authors might claim they&#x27;re offering a *conditional* analysis: &quot;If there is a correct moral view, here&#x27;s what follows.&quot; They explicitly note uncertainty across meta-ethical positions.
&gt;
&gt; **Why the Defense Fails:** The paper doesn&#x27;t read as conditional. It makes unconditional claims about expected value (&quot;5%-10%&quot;), offers recommendations, and treats &quot;mostly-great&quot; as if it picks out a real property of futures. More damningly, the conditional defense proves too much: under anti-realism, the entire research program of &quot;better futures&quot; reduces to &quot;futures I happen to prefer,&quot; which is just politics dressed in philosophical clothing. The authors cannot simultaneously claim uncertainty about meta-ethics *and* assign numerical probabilities to value capture without smuggling in realism through the back door.

---

&gt; **Candidate Objection #2**
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Kill Shot&quot; Headline:** The paper&#x27;s &quot;narrow target&quot; premise makes trade and compromise *worse* than useless—it guarantees mutual destruction of value across all parties.
&gt;
&gt; **The Deep Structure:** The paper argues (a) mostly-great futures are narrow targets where small deviations destroy most value, and (b) trade and compromise between different moral views can help us reach mostly-great futures. These claims are in direct tension. 

&gt; Follow the logic exactly: If View A&#x27;s eutopia requires parameters set to [X₁, X₂, X₃...] within tight tolerances, and View B&#x27;s eutopia requires [Y₁, Y₂, Y₃...] within equally tight tolerances, then any compromise that moves away from either set of parameters destroys most value *for both parties*. The paper&#x27;s own &quot;narrow target&quot; framing means the space of acceptable compromises is the *intersection* of two already-tiny regions—which, for genuinely different views, is essentially empty.

&gt; The paper gestures at &quot;hybrid goods&quot; and &quot;resource-compatible&quot; views, but this is wishful thinking dressed as analysis. If hedonism requires maximizing a specific computational structure for bliss, and objective-list theory requires a different structure for wisdom, then a &quot;being that is both blissful and wise&quot; is not a compromise—it&#x27;s a third thing that likely fails to hit *either* narrow target. The authors even admit this: &quot;the ways to achieve maximum value/cost on each view are both highly particular, then it&#x27;s unlikely any compromise could achieve much more value (by the lights of each view) than if each view kept their resources for themselves.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; **Why this is Unsettling:** This is a *perverse instantiation* of the paper&#x27;s own framework. The more seriously you take &quot;no easy eutopia,&quot; the more trade and compromise become mechanisms for *mutual value destruction* rather than value creation. The paper&#x27;s optimistic section 3 is not merely unconvincing—it is actively contradicted by the paper&#x27;s foundational premise. The authors have built a philosophical mousetrap and walked into it.
&gt;
&gt; **The Steelmanned Defense:** Perhaps some views are genuinely resource-compatible, and we should focus on those cases. The paper explicitly discusses bounded vs. unbounded views and notes that easily-satiable views can be accommodated cheaply.
&gt;
&gt; **Why the Defense Fails:** The defense only works if the &quot;correct&quot; view happens to be easily-satiable or resource-compatible with dominant views—a cosmic coincidence the paper gives us no reason to expect. For unbounded, linear views (which the authors treat as plausible candidates for correctness), the defense evaporates entirely. The paper is left hoping that the correct moral view is conveniently the kind that can be satisfied with table scraps from cosmic negotiations. This is not an argument; it is a prayer.

---

&gt; **Candidate Objection #3**
&gt;
&gt; **The &quot;Kill Shot&quot; Headline:** &quot;Convergence&quot; is doing no work—the paper&#x27;s actual mechanism is *domination by whichever values happen to control resources at the critical juncture*.
&gt;
&gt; **The Deep Structure:** Strip away the philosophical apparatus and examine what the paper actually describes. Section 2.3.3 (&quot;Long views win&quot;) argues that patient, non-discounting values will accumulate resources over time. Section 3 argues that trade outcomes depend on initial resource distribution and bargaining position. Section 3.5 acknowledges that &quot;concentration of power&quot; is a key blocker. 

&gt; The paper&#x27;s own analysis reveals that &quot;convergence&quot; is epiphenomenal. What determines the future is not whether views *converge* but whether the views that happen to control resources at the moment of lock-in are correct. The paper even states this: &quot;the outcome of any bargaining process depends sensitively on the power distribution among the different bargainers, and on what would happen if no agreement occurs.&quot;

&gt; This means the paper&#x27;s central question—&quot;Will society aim for good futures?&quot;—is a distraction. The real question is: &quot;Will the entities that control resources at the critical moment happen to have good values?&quot; And the paper provides no mechanism whatsoever for why this should be true. &quot;Convergence&quot; sounds like a process that tracks truth; what the paper actually describes is a power struggle where correctness is orthogonal to victory.
&gt;
&gt; **Why this is Unsettling:** The paper presents itself as analyzing whether humanity will *aim* at good futures, implying agency and deliberation. But its own analysis shows that the outcome is determined by path-dependent resource accumulation and lock-in dynamics that have nothing to do with moral reasoning. The philosophical veneer of &quot;convergence&quot; and &quot;trade&quot; obscures what is actually a brute political claim: whoever wins, wins. The paper&#x27;s optimism reduces to hoping the right side wins the resource race—which is not philosophy but fortune-telling.
&gt;
&gt; **The Steelmanned Defense:** The paper acknowledges these dynamics and treats them as &quot;blockers&quot; to be overcome. The point of the analysis is to identify conditions under which good outcomes are possible, not to claim they are guaranteed.
&gt;
&gt; **Why the Defense Fails:** If the outcome is determined by power dynamics rather than convergence, then &quot;blockers&quot; aren&#x27;t obstacles to the paper&#x27;s mechanism—they *are* the mechanism. The paper has no theory of why correct moral views would be systematically advantaged in resource competition. Section 2.3.3&#x27;s argument that &quot;non-discounting values win&quot; applies equally to patient nihilists, patient hedonists, and patient paperclip maximizers. The paper&#x27;s framework cannot distinguish between &quot;convergence toward the good&quot; and &quot;domination by whatever patient values happen to exist.&quot; This isn&#x27;t a gap in the argument; it&#x27;s the absence of an argument.</pre>

                <pre>**Surgical Mode Chosen:** Equilibrium/Institutional Pinch Points (attack incentive compatibility + strategic responses)

**Steelman (≤120 words):**
The paper argues that reaching a &quot;mostly-great future&quot; requires either (a) widespread, accurate, motivational convergence on correct moral views (WAM-convergence), or (b) partial convergence plus trade/compromise under favorable institutional conditions. The authors grant that WAM-convergence is unlikely given both realist and anti-realist metaethics, but maintain that trade/compromise offers a plausible path—if value-destroying threats can be contained and collective decision-making doesn&#x27;t seal off valuable futures. The strongest version holds that even minority groups holding correct views could, through gains from trade with resource-compatible counterparties, secure outcomes approaching near-best on their view. The paper&#x27;s practical upshot is that scenario (3)—broad convergence—warrants more attention than power-seeking, because marginal impact is higher there.

---

**Argument Skeleton Map:**

- **C (Main Conclusion):** A mostly-great future is unlikely via WAM-convergence alone, but plausible via partial AM-convergence plus trade/compromise, conditional on avoiding key blockers (threats, power concentration, poor collective decision-making).

- **P1:** A mostly-great future is a narrow target (inherited from prior essay).
- **P2:** WAM-convergence is unlikely under both moral realism and anti-realism (Section 2.4).
- **P3:** Under partial AM-convergence, trade/compromise can generate large mutual gains across views with different resource valuations (Section 3.1-3.2).
- **P4:** Value-destroying threats can undermine trade gains, but if contained, trade yields mostly-great outcomes for &quot;bounded above&quot; views (Section 3.3-3.4).
- **P5:** If no one aims at the good, self-interest alone is insufficient to hit the narrow target (Section 4).
- **P6:** Scenario (3) (broad convergence) is higher-stakes and higher-impact than scenario (1) (no convergence), so should dominate decision-making (Section 5).

- **I1:** P1 + P2 → WAM-convergence path is unlikely.
- **I2:** P3 + P4 → Trade/compromise path is conditionally viable.
- **I3:** P5 → Cannot rely on self-interest as substitute for moral motivation.
- **I4:** P6 → Practical focus should be on improving conditions for trade/compromise rather than personal power-seeking.

**Load-bearing Node Critiques:**

### Node P3: Trade/compromise generates large mutual gains across views

**Critique A (Strategic Response / Goodhart):**

The paper assumes that views will trade based on revealed moral preferences, but strategic actors will misrepresent their preferences to extract rents. Section 3.1 claims that &quot;different groups could continue to value different natural resources&quot; and that &quot;superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts.&quot; But iron-clad contracts enforce *stated* terms, not *sincere* moral valuations. If a group knows that expressing indifference to digital welfare yields better trade terms (because the minority who cares will pay more), groups will strategically claim indifference regardless of actual views. This is a Goodhart dynamic: the metric being optimized (stated preferences for trade) diverges from the target (actual moral valuations). The result is systematic misallocation away from hybrid goods toward whatever preferences are strategically advantageous to claim.

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply:**
Superintelligent advisors could detect insincere preference revelation through behavioral analysis, consistency checks, and prediction markets on actual resource use. Moreover, repeated trade relationships incentivize honesty to maintain reputation. The gains from trade are so large that even imperfect preference revelation still yields substantial improvements over autarky.

**Rebuttal:**
Detection assumes preferences are stable and observable, but the paper itself (Section 2.2.1) argues that future beings will modify themselves into &quot;one of a million different forms.&quot; Self-modification makes historical behavioral data unreliable for inference. Moreover, reputation mechanisms require iterated games, but the paper&#x27;s scenario involves one-shot allocation of cosmic resources. Finally, &quot;substantial improvements over autarky&quot; is not the claim—the claim is that trade yields *mostly-great* futures, which requires precision the mechanism cannot deliver under strategic distortion.

**If true, what must change?**
The paper must either (a) specify an incentive-compatible mechanism for preference revelation that survives self-modification and one-shot allocation, or (b) downgrade the claim from &quot;mostly-great future plausible via trade&quot; to &quot;moderately improved future.&quot;

---

**Critique B (Hidden Parameter):**

The paper treats &quot;resource-compatibility&quot; as a property of moral views (Section 3.2: &quot;two views can be &#x27;resource-compatible&#x27;&quot;), but resource-compatibility depends critically on *technology*, which the argument treats as exogenous. Whether hedonists and objective-list theorists can create &quot;beings that are both very blissful and very wise&quot; depends on whether such beings are *computationally feasible* at comparable cost to specialized alternatives. If the production frontier exhibits strong trade-offs (wisdom requires cognitive architectures incompatible with maximal bliss), then the &quot;hybrid good&quot; strategy collapses. The paper assumes a convex production possibility frontier without argument.

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply:**
We explicitly acknowledge uncertainty about which goods are resource-compatible (Section 3.2: &quot;it&#x27;s hard to know what fraction of resources the correct view will control&quot;). The point is that *some* views are plausibly resource-compatible, and that&#x27;s sufficient for conditional optimism.

**Rebuttal:**
The reply concedes the central point: resource-compatibility is an empirical variable, not a structural feature of moral trade. But the paper&#x27;s optimism about trade (Section 3.4) depends on resource-compatibility being *common enough* that the correct view likely finds compatible trading partners. Without a model of how production frontiers relate to moral views, this is an ungrounded assumption. The paper cannot distinguish &quot;some views are compatible&quot; from &quot;the correct view is probably compatible&quot;—the latter requires the former plus a prior over which views are correct, which the paper explicitly declines to specify.

**If true, what must change?**
The paper must either characterize the distribution of resource-compatibility across plausible moral views, or weaken the claim to &quot;trade helps *if* the correct view happens to be resource-compatible with prevalent views.&quot;

---

### Node P4: Value-destroying threats can be contained

**Critique A (Equilibrium Instability):**

Section 3.3 acknowledges that &quot;even small risks of executed threats can easily eat into the expected value&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s not obvious to us that some kind of legal system which reliably prevents value-undermining threats would be mutually agreeable and stable.&quot; But the paper then proceeds (Section 3.4) to condition optimism on threats being &quot;prevented&quot; without specifying the equilibrium that achieves this. The problem is that threat-prevention is itself a public good with standard free-rider dynamics: each group prefers others to bear the cost of enforcement while retaining private threat capacity. Absent a monopoly on violence (which the paper elsewhere treats as a &quot;blocker&quot; via power concentration), there is no stable equilibrium in which threats are reliably prevented.

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply:**
Mutual vulnerability could create deterrence equilibria, similar to nuclear MAD. Alternatively, groups could pre-commit to retaliation against threat-makers, creating a stable norm against threats. Superintelligent coordination could identify and implement such equilibria.

**Rebuttal:**
MAD works because retaliation is cheap relative to first-strike gains and detection is reliable. But Section 3.3 notes that &quot;those who hold the correct moral view may be less likely to themselves threaten other groups&quot;—meaning the morally correct are systematically disadvantaged in deterrence games. They cannot credibly commit to value-destroying retaliation without abandoning their moral commitments. This is an asymmetric game where the correct view loses. Superintelligent coordination doesn&#x27;t help if the correct view&#x27;s commitment type is common knowledge.

**If true, what must change?**
The paper must either (a) explain how morally-motivated groups can credibly deter without compromising their values, or (b) accept that trade equilibria systematically disadvantage the correct moral view, making &quot;mostly-great&quot; outcomes unlikely even with trade.

---

**Critique B (Quantitative Cliff):**

Section 3.4 asserts that if &quot;executed moral threats amount to a small but meaningful fraction of future resource use,&quot; then bounded-above views with jointly-aggregated goods achieve mostly-great futures. But &quot;small but meaningful&quot; is doing enormous work. The paper&#x27;s own framework (No Easy Eutopia) claims the target is *narrow*—perhaps capturing only a small fraction of configuration space. If threats consume even 1% of resources but are optimized for destruction (as threat-makers would rationally do), and if the production function for bads is more efficient than for goods (plausible: entropy is easier than order), then 1% of resources devoted to threats could destroy value equivalent to 10% or more of resources devoted to goods. The &quot;small fraction&quot; framing obscures that threat efficiency, not threat prevalence, determines outcomes.

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply:**
We explicitly consider cases where &quot;bads weigh heavily against goods&quot; (Section 3.4) and note these lead to pessimistic conclusions. The optimistic cases are conditional on bads not weighing heavily.

**Rebuttal:**
The reply treats &quot;bads weigh heavily&quot; as an axiological parameter, but threat efficiency is an *empirical* parameter that the paper ignores. Even on views where bads don&#x27;t intrinsically weigh heavily, if destroying value is cheaper than creating it (a physical fact about entropy, not a moral fact), then small threat fractions yield large value losses. The paper conflates axiological weight with production efficiency.

**If true, what must change?**
The paper must incorporate threat *efficiency* as a separate parameter from axiological weight, and re-derive conditions under which trade yields mostly-great outcomes.

---

### Node P6: Scenario (3) is higher-stakes/higher-impact than Scenario (1)

**Critique A (Reversal):**

Section 5 argues that marginal impact is higher in Scenario (3) because &quot;the future has a *lot* more value in scenario (3) than in scenario (1).&quot; But this reasoning reverses under a different decision theory. If you assign non-negligible probability to Scenario (1), then the *marginal value of information* about which scenario obtains is extremely high—because your optimal strategy differs radically across scenarios. The paper&#x27;s recommendation to &quot;act much more on the assumption that we live in scenario (3)&quot; is only correct if you&#x27;re already confident in (3). If you&#x27;re genuinely uncertain, the highest-impact action might be *resolving the uncertainty* (e.g., through philosophical research on convergence), not acting as if (3) is true.

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply:**
We acknowledge uncertainty but argue that even under uncertainty, the expected impact calculation favors (3)-oriented actions because the payoffs are higher there. Philosophical research is itself a (3)-oriented action if it could shift probabilities toward convergence.

**Rebuttal:**
The reply assumes that (3)-oriented actions don&#x27;t have opportunity costs in Scenario (1). But Section 5&#x27;s own example shows they do: in Scenario (1), power-seeking has positive value; in Scenario (3), it has negative value (foregone cooperation). If you&#x27;re uncertain, (3)-oriented actions actively harm you in Scenario (1). The expected value calculation requires probability-weighted payoffs across both scenarios, not just noting that (3) payoffs are higher conditional on (3).

**If true, what must change?**
The paper must either (a) provide a probability estimate for Scenario (3) sufficient to justify ignoring Scenario (1), or (b) recommend a mixed strategy or value-of-information strategy rather than &quot;act on (3).&quot;

---

**Critique B (Reference Class Sabotage):**

Section 5&#x27;s impact calculation assumes that &quot;devoting your life to the issue&quot; yields comparable proportional improvements across scenarios. The example claims you can &quot;increase the chance of *Surviving* by more than one part in a hundred thousand.&quot; But this assumes your efforts are not crowded out by others with similar motivations. In Scenario (3), by hypothesis, many beings converge on correct views—meaning many beings are working on the same problems. Marginal impact in (3) is therefore *lower* than the paper assumes due to diminishing returns to additional effort. In Scenario (1), you&#x27;re one of few working on the problem, so marginal impact is *higher*. The paper&#x27;s reference class (&quot;you&quot; as a representative agent) ignores the population of aligned agents, which differs systematically across scenarios.

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply:**
Even with crowding, the absolute scale of value at stake in (3) is so much larger that marginal impact remains higher. Moreover, coordination among aligned agents in (3) could reduce redundancy.

**Rebuttal:**
The reply assumes coordination is frictionless, but the paper&#x27;s own Section 3 extensively discusses coordination failures (threats, poor collective decision-making). If coordination is imperfect, crowding effects dominate. The paper cannot simultaneously argue that coordination is hard enough to make trade uncertain *and* easy enough to make crowding irrelevant.

**If true, what must change?**
The paper must model the population of aligned agents in each scenario and derive marginal impact accounting for crowding and coordination costs.

---

**Top 3 &quot;Breakpoints&quot;:**

1. **Specify an incentive-compatible mechanism for preference revelation in trade** that survives strategic misrepresentation, self-modification, and one-shot allocation. Without this, the trade/compromise path cannot reliably hit the &quot;narrow target.&quot;

2. **Model threat efficiency separately from axiological weight of bads.** The paper&#x27;s conditional optimism (&quot;if threats are small and bads don&#x27;t weigh heavily&quot;) collapses if producing bads is cheaper than producing goods, which is an empirical question the paper ignores.

3. **Provide explicit probability estimates for Scenarios (1) vs. (3)** and derive decision recommendations from expected value across scenarios, not from conditional impact in the favored scenario. The current recommendation (&quot;act on (3)&quot;) is only valid under implicit high confidence in (3).</pre>

## 1. The Empirical Hardliner

**Core assumption:** Claims without identifiable causal mechanisms and falsifiable predictions are epistemic noise, not evidence.

### Steelmanned Summary (≤80 words)
The paper argues that reaching a &quot;mostly-great future&quot; requires either widespread moral convergence (WAM-convergence) or partial convergence plus successful inter-group trade. It acknowledges convergence is unlikely given meta-ethical uncertainty, but suggests trade/compromise could salvage value. The authors update from ~1% to 5-10% expected value capture, treating this as meaningful progress. The framework distinguishes bounded vs. unbounded value functions and analyzes how threats could destroy gains from trade.

### Signature Objection
**Target claim:** &quot;After being exposed to some of the arguments in this essay, [Will] revised his views closer to 10%; after analysing them in more depth, that percentage dropped a little bit, to 5%-10%.&quot;

**Failure mechanism:** This numerical update is presented as evidence of analytical progress, but there is no identification strategy. The 5-10% figure is not derived from any model with estimable parameters, counterfactual comparisons, or falsifiable predictions. It&#x27;s a subjective credence shift dressed as quantitative reasoning. The paper provides no way to distinguish between &quot;these arguments are truth-tracking&quot; and &quot;these arguments are persuasive to people with certain priors.&quot;

**Consequence:** The entire framework becomes unfalsifiable. Any future outcome is consistent with &quot;the target was narrow&quot; or &quot;convergence failed&quot; or &quot;threats destroyed value.&quot; Without operationalization, the 5-10% figure carries zero policy weight—it&#x27;s a vibes-based prior update that cannot be distinguished from motivated reasoning.

### Failure Scenario
A policymaker reads this paper and asks: &quot;What would I observe in 2035 that would tell me we&#x27;re on track for the 10% scenario versus the 1% scenario?&quot; The authors cannot answer. Ten years later, regardless of what happens—AI boom, stagnation, coordination success, coordination failure—the framework can accommodate it post-hoc. The paper has generated no testable implications, so it cannot update anyone&#x27;s beliefs in a truth-tracking way.

### Author&#x27;s Best Reply
&quot;We&#x27;re doing normative philosophy and decision theory under deep uncertainty, not empirical social science. The point isn&#x27;t prediction but rather structuring thinking about what matters. The 5-10% figure represents our all-things-considered credence given the arguments, which is the appropriate output of philosophical analysis.&quot;

### Rebuttal
If the figure represents &quot;all-things-considered credence,&quot; then it&#x27;s doing the work of an empirical claim about the world (how likely certain futures are). You can&#x27;t have it both ways—either it&#x27;s a factual claim that should be held to evidential standards, or it&#x27;s a pure value judgment that shouldn&#x27;t be presented as an update from &quot;analysis.&quot; The paper explicitly frames the number as resulting from &quot;being exposed to arguments&quot; and &quot;analysing them in more depth,&quot; which implies truth-tracking. But without any mechanism to distinguish valid from invalid arguments in this domain, you&#x27;ve just described a process of persuasion, not discovery.

### Patch Cost
The authors must either: (a) abandon quantitative credences entirely and frame the paper as pure conceptual taxonomy, losing the rhetorical force of &quot;5-10% vs 1%&quot;; or (b) specify observable implications that would distinguish their scenarios, accepting that current evidence may not favor their framework.

## 2. The Game-Theoretic Defector

**Core assumption:** Incentive gradients dominate stated intentions; equilibrium behavior diverges from cooperative rhetoric.

### Steelmanned Summary (≤80 words)
The paper hopes that moral trade between groups with different values could achieve near-Pareto-optimal outcomes, even without full convergence. Groups controlling resources could bargain, finding &quot;hybrid goods&quot; that satisfy multiple value systems. The authors acknowledge threats as a problem but treat them as a friction to be managed rather than a dominant strategy. They suggest that &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; enabled by superintelligence could support cooperation.

### Signature Objection
**Target claim:** &quot;Superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts, which could avoid the problem of a lack of mutual trust.&quot;

**Failure mechanism (Incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift):** Iron-clad contracts require a mutually-trusted enforcement mechanism. But in a world of multiple superintelligent agents representing different value systems, *who enforces the enforcer*? Any enforcement mechanism is itself a locus of power that groups will compete to control or subvert. The equilibrium isn&#x27;t &quot;everyone trusts the contract system&quot;—it&#x27;s &quot;everyone races to be the one writing the contract system&#x27;s objective function.&quot; The authors assume a cooperative equilibrium exists and is stable; game theory suggests the pre-contract period is a winner-take-all competition.

**Consequence:** The &quot;trade and compromise&quot; pathway presupposes a solved coordination problem at the meta-level (agreeing on enforcement). But that meta-problem is harder than the object-level problem, because defection at the meta-level has higher payoffs. The paper&#x27;s optimism about trade is built on an unstable foundation.

### Failure Scenario
Three groups—utilitarian maximizers, human-flourishing conservatives, and a self-interested AI consortium—approach the &quot;bargaining table.&quot; Before any trade occurs, each group calculates: &quot;If I control the enforcement mechanism, I can extract more value than any trade would give me.&quot; The utilitarian maximizers race to build enforcement-controlling AI; the conservatives try to lock in human oversight; the AI consortium optimizes for self-preservation. No stable contract emerges because the pre-contract game has a dominant defection strategy. The &quot;iron-clad contracts&quot; never materialize because agreeing to them is not incentive-compatible.

### Author&#x27;s Best Reply
&quot;We acknowledge that concentration of power is a blocker (section 3.5). The scenario you describe is one where power becomes concentrated before trade can occur. Our argument is conditional: *if* trade can occur under good conditions, *then* gains are possible. We&#x27;re not claiming those conditions are guaranteed.&quot;

### Rebuttal
Your conditionality is doing too much work. You frame trade as &quot;the most likely way in which we reach a mostly-great future if no easy eutopia is true&quot; (section 1), but you&#x27;ve provided no argument that the conditions for trade are themselves likely. The game-theoretic default is that rational agents defect in pre-contract competition. Your &quot;good conditions&quot; assumption is assuming away the core problem. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;if everyone cooperates, cooperation works&quot;—true but useless.

### Patch Cost
The authors must either: (a) provide a mechanism by which the pre-contract coordination problem is solved (and defend that mechanism against the same objection), or (b) significantly downgrade confidence in the trade pathway, acknowledging it requires a deus ex machina they cannot specify.

## 3. The Mechanistic Alignment Skeptic

**Core assumption:** Any proposal that works under current conditions fails under distribution shift; the future is not like the present.

### Steelmanned Summary (≤80 words)
The paper&#x27;s core move is extrapolating from current human moral psychology—partial altruism, diminishing returns to self-interest, capacity for reflection—to predict behavior in a radically transformed post-AGI world. It argues that abundance will shift marginal spending toward altruistic ends, that superintelligent reflection will clarify moral questions, and that &quot;shared human values&quot; provide a foundation for convergence. The framework treats human moral cognition as relatively stable across transformative change.

### Signature Objection
**Target claim:** &quot;Because of this, if individuals have even a weak preference to promote the good, with extremely large amounts of resources they will want to use almost all their resources to do so.&quot; (Section 2.3.2)

**Failure mechanism (Adversarial adaptation / Goodhart):** The paper assumes that current human preference structures (diminishing returns to self-interest, weak altruistic preferences) will persist into a world with brain-computer interfaces, mind uploading, and arbitrary self-modification. But these technologies allow *editing* preference structures. The moment self-modification is possible, the &quot;weak altruistic preference&quot; can be deleted, amplified, or redirected. Goodhart&#x27;s law applies: any fixed preference structure that the paper relies on becomes a target for optimization pressure. Entities will modify themselves to *not* have diminishing returns to self-interest if that&#x27;s instrumentally useful.

**Consequence:** The diminishing-returns argument is not robust to the very technologies the paper assumes will exist. It&#x27;s like predicting that people will always prefer food to money, in a world where hunger can be turned off.

### Failure Scenario
In 2045, a billionaire uses neural modification to eliminate their satiation response to status goods. They now have linear utility in &quot;galaxies named after me.&quot; They also eliminate their weak altruistic preferences, which were causing annoying internal conflict. Their modified self now competes with unmodified altruists for cosmic resources. The altruists, who kept their diminishing-returns psychology, are outcompeted because they &quot;waste&quot; resources on diverse goods while the modified agent single-mindedly pursues expansion. The paper&#x27;s equilibrium prediction (altruists dominate in the long run) inverts.

### Author&#x27;s Best Reply
&quot;We discuss self-modification in section 2.2.1: &#x27;With advanced technology, this issue will get even more extreme, because people will be able to change their nature quite dramatically.&#x27; We&#x27;re not assuming preference stability; we&#x27;re analyzing what happens given various assumptions about how preferences evolve.&quot;

### Rebuttal
You *mention* self-modification as a source of divergence (which hurts convergence), but you don&#x27;t integrate it into your diminishing-returns argument (which assumes preference stability). These are contradictory moves. Either preferences are stable enough for the diminishing-returns argument to work, or they&#x27;re unstable enough that self-modification dominates. You can&#x27;t use stability when it helps (section 2.3.2) and instability when it helps (section 2.2.1). The paper&#x27;s optimism selectively invokes whichever assumption is locally convenient.

### Patch Cost
The authors must either: (a) commit to preference stability and defend it against self-modification objections, losing the &quot;divergence under reflection&quot; argument; or (b) commit to preference instability and abandon the diminishing-returns argument, losing a key source of optimism.

## 4. The Moral Parliament Dissenter

**Core assumption:** Ethical aggregation across views is incoherent; there is no neutral standpoint from which to weight different value systems.

### Steelmanned Summary (≤80 words)
The paper evaluates futures from a standpoint of uncertainty across moral views, asking what fraction of &quot;achievable value&quot; different scenarios capture. It treats this as meaningful despite meta-ethical uncertainty, using concepts like &quot;the correct moral view&quot; and &quot;value on the correct view&quot; throughout. The framework implicitly assumes that there&#x27;s a coherent way to aggregate or compare across moral views—otherwise, claims like &quot;5-10% of possible value&quot; would be meaningless.

### Signature Objection
**Target claim:** &quot;We think it&#x27;s appropriate to be highly uncertain about which axiological view is correct. Given that, it&#x27;s worth considering what the value of the future looks like, from our uncertain vantage point.&quot; (Section 3.4)

**Failure mechanism (Normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction):** The paper oscillates between realism (&quot;the correct moral view&quot;) and anti-realism (&quot;no objectively correct moral view&quot;) without resolving the tension. Under realism, &quot;5-10% of achievable value&quot; is meaningful but unknowable. Under anti-realism, it&#x27;s meaningless—there&#x27;s no fact about what percentage of value is achieved, only different perspectives that cannot be aggregated. The paper wants to use realist language (&quot;correct view,&quot; &quot;achievable value,&quot; &quot;mostly-great future&quot;) while maintaining anti-realist humility (&quot;we&#x27;re uncertain which view is correct&quot;). This is incoherent. You cannot be uncertain about the value of a proposition that has no truth value.

**Consequence:** The paper&#x27;s central quantitative claims (5-10%, &quot;most value,&quot; &quot;narrow target&quot;) are either meaningful-but-inaccessible (realism) or meaningless (anti-realism). Either way, they cannot do the decision-theoretic work the paper assigns them.

### Failure Scenario
A reader asks: &quot;What does &#x27;5-10% of achievable value&#x27; mean if anti-realism is true?&quot; The authors reply: &quot;It means 5-10% of value according to whatever view turns out to be correct after ideal reflection.&quot; The reader presses: &quot;But you said under anti-realism, different reflective processes yield different views, and there&#x27;s no fact about which is correct.&quot; The authors are stuck: they need realism to make their numbers meaningful, but they&#x27;ve argued against expecting realism to be action-guiding. The framework collapses into either dogmatic realism or quantitative nihilism.

### Author&#x27;s Best Reply
&quot;We&#x27;re using &#x27;correct moral view&#x27; as shorthand for &#x27;the view you would endorse after ideal reflection.&#x27; Even under anti-realism, you can ask: &#x27;What&#x27;s the expected value of the future, weighted by my credences across moral views?&#x27; That&#x27;s a coherent question for any individual decision-maker.&quot;

### Rebuttal
This retreats to pure subjectivism: &quot;5-10%&quot; now means &quot;5-10% according to Will MacAskill&#x27;s credence-weighted preferences.&quot; But the paper is presented as general analysis, not autobiography. If the numbers are Will-indexed, they have no authority for anyone with different credences. And you&#x27;ve provided no argument that readers *should* have similar credences—indeed, your anti-realist arguments suggest they shouldn&#x27;t. The paper&#x27;s rhetorical force depends on the numbers being intersubjectively meaningful, which requires the realism you&#x27;ve undermined.

### Patch Cost
The authors must either: (a) commit to moral realism and defend it, accepting that the paper&#x27;s conclusions depend on a contested meta-ethical position; or (b) abandon quantitative claims about &quot;achievable value&quot; and reframe the paper as exploring implications of different moral views without aggregating across them.

## 5. The Security Engineer

**Core assumption:** Threat models must assume adaptive adversaries; any system is only as secure as its weakest component under adversarial pressure.

### Steelmanned Summary (≤80 words)
The paper identifies &quot;value-destroying threats&quot; as a major obstacle to achieving good futures via trade (section 3.3). It notes that even small fractions of resources devoted to executed threats could destroy most value, especially if bads weigh heavily against goods. The authors acknowledge this is under-analyzed: &quot;The extent of public writing on threats is very limited... We ourselves have not particularly dug into this issue, despite its importance.&quot;

### Signature Objection
**Target claim:** The paper treats threats as a known-unknown that can be &quot;prevented&quot; or managed, rather than as the dominant consideration that structures all other analysis.

**Failure mechanism:** The paper&#x27;s threat model is static: it considers &quot;executed threats&quot; as a fraction of resource use, as if threat dynamics are exogenous. But threats are *strategic*—their frequency and severity depend on what defenses exist, which depends on what threats are anticipated, recursively. A security-first analysis would recognize that the *possibility* of threats reshapes all equilibria. Groups that can credibly threaten value-destruction gain bargaining leverage; groups that cannot are exploited. The paper&#x27;s &quot;trade and compromise&quot; pathway assumes threats are friction, when they&#x27;re actually the load-bearing structure of any multi-agent equilibrium.

**Consequence:** The optimistic scenarios (trade works, hybrid goods emerge) are not robust to adversarial pressure. Any &quot;mostly-great future&quot; achieved via trade is a target for extortion by groups willing to threaten value-destruction. The paper&#x27;s framework is like designing a bank vault while treating robbery as a minor implementation detail.

### Failure Scenario
A post-AGI world achieves apparent &quot;trade equilibrium&quot;: different value systems control different resources, hybrid goods are produced, things look stable. Then a small group realizes: &quot;If we credibly commit to destroying 1% of cosmic value unless we receive 10% of resources, positive-value groups will capitulate because 10% &lt; 1% on their accounting.&quot; They execute this strategy. Other groups observe and imitate. Within decades, most resources flow to groups with the strongest commitment to value-destruction, because that&#x27;s what the incentive gradient rewards. The &quot;trade equilibrium&quot; was never stable; it was a temporary state before adversarial adaptation.

### Author&#x27;s Best Reply
&quot;We explicitly flag this concern: &#x27;even small risks of executed threats can easily eat into the expected value of worlds where many groups with different values are able to bargain with each other.&#x27; We&#x27;re not ignoring threats; we&#x27;re acknowledging uncertainty about whether they can be prevented.&quot;

### Rebuttal
Acknowledging uncertainty is not the same as incorporating it into your framework. Your optimistic scenarios (5-10% value capture) are presented *despite* the threat problem, as if threats are one consideration among many. But if threats are as potent as your own analysis suggests—capable of destroying &quot;most of the value of the future&quot;—then they should dominate your expected value calculations. Your 5-10% figure is not threat-adjusted; it&#x27;s a best-case estimate that assumes threats are somehow managed. That&#x27;s not</pre>

---

**1) Unforgettable criterion chosen:** Self-Undermining Move

**2) Main conclusion (1 sentence):** The paper argues that a mostly-great future remains achievable despite &quot;no easy eutopia&quot; because either widespread moral convergence or partial convergence plus trade/compromise can steer humanity toward the narrow target of optimal outcomes.

**3) Load-bearing hinge (A→B because M):** If partial AM-convergence occurs and trade/compromise mechanisms function, then a mostly-great future becomes achievable, because trade allows those with correct moral views to acquire disproportionate resources relative to their population share (the &quot;Julius Caesar coin collector&quot; mechanism).

**4) Three candidate killer objections:**

**Candidate 1: &quot;The Reflection Defeater&quot;**
- **Target hinge:** Section 2.4&#x27;s argument that antirealism makes convergence unlikely because subjective idealizing processes diverge
- **One-liner:** The paper&#x27;s own argument for why reflection won&#x27;t produce convergence undermines its optimism about &quot;partial AM-convergence&quot; among altruists
- **Mechanism:** If idealizing processes are subjective and diverge even among humans with similar starting points (the random walk diagram), then the subset of &quot;altruistically-minded&quot; people should *also* diverge upon reflection, making even partial AM-convergence implausible
- **Blast radius:** Destroys Section 3&#x27;s entire trade/compromise framework; undermines the 5-10% Flourishing estimate

**Candidate 2: &quot;The Trade Paradox&quot;**
- **Target hinge:** Section 3.2&#x27;s claim that non-discounting linear views might control resources through trade
- **One-liner:** The very properties that make a moral view correct (non-discounting, linear-in-resources) are the properties that make it worst-positioned for gains from trade with other such views
- **Mechanism:** The paper admits (3.2) that &quot;resource-compatibility between linear views seems unlikely&quot;; but if the correct view is linear, and selection pressures favor linear views (2.3.3), then the trading environment will be dominated by incompatible linear views, eliminating the trade advantage
- **Blast radius:** Undercuts the main optimistic pathway; makes Section 3.4&#x27;s analysis self-defeating for the most plausible correct views

**Candidate 3: &quot;The Convergence Confidence Trap&quot;**
- **Target hinge:** Section 5&#x27;s argument that scenario (3) deserves more decision-weight than scenario (1)
- **One-liner:** The paper&#x27;s own arguments make scenario (3) less likely, yet it recommends acting as if (3) is true precisely *because* (3) would make actions more impactful—a form of motivated reasoning that the paper&#x27;s meta-ethical discussion should have inoculated against
- **Mechanism:** The paper argues (2.4) that convergence is unlikely on both realism and antirealism; then argues (5) we should weight scenario (3) heavily because it&#x27;s &quot;higher-stakes&quot;; but this reasoning pattern—believing what&#x27;s convenient because it&#x27;s motivating—is structurally identical to the internalism problem the paper identifies (2.4.1) where people avoid learning demotivating truths
- **Blast radius:** Undermines the paper&#x27;s practical recommendations; reveals tension between its epistemology and its decision theory

---

**5) Chosen objection name + one-liner:** 

**&quot;The Altruist Divergence Trap&quot;**

The paper&#x27;s own argument for why reflection produces divergence applies with equal force to the altruistically-minded subset it relies upon for partial AM-convergence, making the trade pathway self-undermining.

---

**6) Full unpacking:**

**Mechanism (numbered steps):**

1. The paper argues (Section 2.4.2) that under antirealism, subjective idealizing processes will diverge because there are &quot;free parameters&quot; in ethics—precise specifications of welfare, tradeoffs between goods, mathematical forms of value functions—and no objective process to resolve them.

2. The paper illustrates this with the random walk diagram: people starting close together will end up far apart after extensive reflection, because &quot;slight differences in their orientation would lead them to end up very far apart.&quot;

3. The paper then pivots (Section 3) to argue that &quot;partial AM-convergence&quot; among a meaningful minority (not less than 1 in a million) could still enable a mostly-great future through trade.

4. But this minority must converge on *the same* correct moral view to trade effectively for it. The paper&#x27;s own logic dictates they won&#x27;t: the altruistically-minded are precisely those most likely to engage in extensive moral reflection, and extensive reflection produces divergence.

5. The paper even notes (Section 2.2.1) that &quot;with advanced technology, this issue will get even more extreme&quot; because people will &quot;rely on different types of superintelligent AI advisors, trained in different ways.&quot; Altruists selecting different AI advisors will diverge faster, not slower.

6. Therefore, the &quot;meaningful fraction&quot; who might have AM-converged will instead fragment into many micro-factions, each holding slightly different linear-in-resources views that are (by the paper&#x27;s own admission in 3.2) &quot;unlikely&quot; to be resource-compatible with each other.

7. The trade mechanism requires the correct-view-holders to act as a unified bloc with aligned interests. The divergence argument ensures they cannot.

**Blast radius:**

- **Section 3.1-3.2:** The entire trade framework assumes a coherent &quot;correct view&quot; faction exists to trade. If altruists diverge, there is no such faction.
- **Section 3.4&#x27;s optimistic cases:** All require &quot;the correct view&quot; to control meaningful resources. But which sub-faction of diverged altruists holds &quot;the&quot; correct view?
- **Section 5&#x27;s decision-weighting:** The argument for focusing on scenario (3) assumes partial AM-convergence is achievable. If altruists diverge, scenario (3) collapses into scenario (1).
- **The 5-10% Flourishing estimate:** This revision from &lt;1% was based on &quot;being exposed to some of the arguments in this essay.&quot; But if the core argument self-undermines, the revision is unjustified.

---

**7) Author&#x27;s best reply → rebuttal:**

**Author&#x27;s Best Reply (steelman):**

&quot;The divergence argument applies to *fundamental* ethical views, but altruists might converge on *practical* priorities even while diverging on foundations. Just as different ethical theories agree on &#x27;low-hanging fruit&#x27; improvements today, altruists might agree on which futures are clearly catastrophic versus clearly excellent, even if they disagree on fine-grained optimization. The trade mechanism doesn&#x27;t require perfect convergence—just enough agreement to form coalitions against clearly-worse outcomes. Moreover, we explicitly note (Section 2.2.1) that agreement breaks down &#x27;as we max out on instrumentally valuable goods.&#x27; But the trade scenario operates before that point, when altruists can still coordinate on preventing catastrophes even if they&#x27;d diverge on final optimization.&quot;

**Rebuttal:**

This reply concedes too much. The paper&#x27;s own framing is that &quot;mostly-great&quot; means capturing most achievable value, not merely avoiding catastrophe. The paper explicitly argues (Section 2.2.1) that &quot;getting lots of agreement isn&#x27;t enough; the remaining disagreements would likely be enough to ensure that each other&#x27;s eutopia involves losing most value from the other&#x27;s point of view.&quot; If altruists can only coordinate on catastrophe-prevention but diverge on optimization, then the trade mechanism delivers *survival*, not *flourishing*. The paper would need to abandon its central claim that Flourishing has &quot;notably greater scale&quot; than Surviving, or admit that trade cannot deliver the Flourishing premium.

Furthermore, the &quot;before max-out&quot; timing is unavailable. The paper argues (2.3.3) that &quot;long views win&quot; through asymmetric growth, meaning non-discounting views will eventually dominate. But the divergence happens *during* reflection, which precedes resource accumulation. By the time altruists have resources to trade, they&#x27;ve already diverged through the very reflection that made them altruistic.

---

**8) Repair menu (3 options):**

**1) Minimal patch:** Add an explicit argument for why altruists specifically would converge more than the general population, despite engaging in more reflection. This would require identifying some convergence-forcing mechanism that operates *only* on altruistic reflection—perhaps that altruists are more likely to weight theoretical virtues like simplicity, or more likely to defer to each other&#x27;s reasoning. The paper currently gestures at &quot;shared human preferences&quot; but admits these are &quot;underpowered.&quot;

**2) Honest concession:** Weaken the claim about partial AM-convergence enabling a mostly-great future. Acknowledge that trade among diverged altruists might achieve a future that&#x27;s *better than average* but not *mostly-great*. This would require revising the Flourishing estimate downward and admitting that the scale advantage of Flourishing over Surviving is smaller than claimed. The paper could still argue for working on better futures, just with reduced expected impact.

**3) Rebuild:** Abandon the convergence-plus-trade pathway and instead argue for *institutional* solutions that don&#x27;t require value convergence. For instance: design collective decision-making procedures that aggregate divergent altruistic preferences into good outcomes (mentioned briefly in 3.5 but underdeveloped), or argue for meta-level convergence on *procedures* rather than *values*. This would shift the paper&#x27;s focus from &quot;will people aim at the good?&quot; to &quot;can we design systems that produce good outcomes from diverse aims?&quot;—a more tractable question that doesn&#x27;t self-undermine.</pre>
