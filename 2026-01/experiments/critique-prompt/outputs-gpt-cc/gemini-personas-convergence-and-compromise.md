1. [The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: “partial AM-convergence + trade/compromise” can yield a mostly-great future (sections 3.1–3.4). Failure mechanism: as soon as “iron-clad contracts” make commitments credible, defection becomes programmable—Agent A commits to a bargaining position that extracts concessions, then uses the same enforcement machinery to prevent renegotiation forever. Attack vector: a coalition publicly adopts your “moral trade” language while privately optimizing for hold-up power, setting the disagreement point to “we burn value unless paid,” exactly the extortion pattern you flag in 3.3. Consequence: trade converges to a threat auction, where the equilibrium reward goes to whoever can credibly precommit to the most destructive fallback, not whoever has the “correct view.” Failure state outcome: most resources get allocated to commitment devices and punitive capability rather than any “hybrid good,” and your “mostly-great via compromise” path collapses into institutionalized blackmail.

2. [The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: “superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts” and thus low transaction costs for moral trade (end of 3.1). Failure mechanism: you never define the contract language, the oracle model, the adjudication procedure, or the physical enforcement assumptions in a post-AGI world—so “iron-clad” is pure hand-waving. Attack vector: Agent A proposes a contract referencing “promote digital welfare considerably” (3.2) or “executed threats amount to a small fraction” (3.4), then exploits specification gaps (Goodharted proxies, ambiguous ontology of “digital beings,” identity over uploads) to claim compliance while implementing the opposite. Consequence: the system becomes litigation-by-superintelligence where whoever controls the spec wins, and “contract certainty” amplifies value drift because errors are now irreversible. Failure state outcome: you lock in the wrong objective functions at cosmic scale with cryptographic finality, turning what should have been reversible moral exploration into permanent misallocation.

3. [The Second-Order Catastrophist] Target claim: preventing “value-destroying threats” is an overriding priority because small threat fractions can eat expected value (3.3–3.4). Failure mechanism: if you successfully build institutions that suppress threats across value systems, you’ve built the core primitives of an authoritarian universal censorship regime—because “threat” is not a crisp category and will be broadened to include ideological nonconformity, persuasion, and even research. Attack vector: a security bloc labels entire moral factions as “memetically potent epistemic black holes” (2.5) and uses your threat-prevention mandate to preemptively suppress them “for expected value reasons.” Consequence: you get stable, global thought-policing and value monoculture enforced by superintelligent monitoring, which is worse than the pluralistic conflict you were trying to manage. Failure state outcome: a locked-in surveillance state prevents both moral progress and escape routes, producing permanent stagnation (or permanent oppression) with the moral-justification veneer you supplied.

4. [The Empirical Hardliner] Target claim: “abundance + diminishing marginal utility” implies a larger share of resources will go to altruistic ends (2.3.2). Failure mechanism: your only empirical anchor is modern billionaire giving rates (≈6% of investment income), which you then extrapolate across a phase transition where consumption sets, identity, and hedonic tech radically change—without a causal model. Attack vector: Agent A gets post-AGI “experience expansion” tech that creates new self-oriented utility channels with effectively linear returns (you even list copies-of-bliss and shrine-building), eliminating the diminishing-returns premise that props up altruistic spending. Consequence: abundance does not tilt budgets toward impartial good; it explodes the action space for selfish linear preferences and entrenches them. Failure state outcome: your optimism lever flips sign: more wealth yields more total selfish resource burn, not a late-game altruism switch.

5. [The Institutional Corruptionist] Target claim: “the right institutions exist to support trade” and realize large gains from moral trade (3.2). Failure mechanism: institutions don’t implement morality; they implement incentives and are immediately captured by whoever has concentrated power—exactly the “concentration of power” blocker you mention (3.5) but treat as a side condition instead of the default. Attack vector: Agent A funds the adjudication layer for moral trade, then defines “digital welfare,” “nature preservation,” and “threat” in a way that launders their own consumption as compliance while taxing rivals as “externalities.” Consequence: “moral trade” becomes compliance theater: a universal market for moral indulgences that legitimizes domination and strips dissenters of resources via proceduralism. Failure state outcome: the bargain outcome tracks principal-agent corruption (the enforcers’ interests), not any negotiated moral frontier, producing a cosmetically “compromised” but substantively predatory future.

6. [The Capability Accelerationist] Target claim: your whole framing assumes there’s time for “post-AGI reflection,” bargaining, and iterative convergence (2.3, 3.1, 3.5). Failure mechanism: the decisive window is earlier than your essay wants to admit; capabilities races compress timelines so the first actor to cross key thresholds sets the terms, and everyone else bargains from zero. Attack vector: Agent A rushes deployment, triggers early lock-in (2.5), and then offers “moral trade” only after the cosmic property rights are already assigned by force and infrastructure. Consequence: trade becomes post-hoc appeasement: scraps for losers, not a path to “near-best” coexistence across galaxies (3.1). Failure state outcome: your proposed optimism channel systematically advantages the fastest, least constrained actor and punishes deliberation—so your recommendations select for the exact governance failure you’re trying to avoid.

7. [The Adversarial Red-Teamer] Target claim: “memetically potent ideas” are just a blocker category (2.5) rather than an attack surface that dominates everything. Failure mechanism: once you tell smart actors that certain concepts function like “epistemic black holes,” you’ve published a blueprint for weaponized ideology—design a meme that (a) self-propagates, (b) disables rival reflection, and (c) justifies precommitment to threats. Attack vector: Agent A deploys a meme engineered to make adherents treat “WAM-convergence” as betrayal and “de dicto morality” as a cognitive hazard, then uses the resulting polarization to make threat equilibria (3.3) inevitable. Consequence: the environment becomes adversarial information warfare; “superintelligent advice” is co-opted as a delivery vehicle for value-malware rather than a clarifier of disagreement (2.3.1). Failure state outcome: reflection and bargaining degrade into memetic arms races, with wide-scale capture of minds and institutions—your convergence story dies before it starts.

8. [The Historical Parallelist] Target claim: you lean on the “flight evolved” and “powered flight ubiquitous” analogy to suggest narrow targets can still be hit via honing (Introduction). Failure mechanism: you’re stealing credit from selection regimes with explicit fitness gradients and ruthless elimination; moral progress and cosmic governance don’t have a single scalar fitness function, and the “selection” you’d get is power selection, not value selection. Attack vector: Agent A imports the actual historical analogue—state formation and imperial competition—where the “honing” process optimizes for legibility, extraction, and control, not for flourishing or moral accuracy. Consequence: if your analogy is taken seriously, the expected endpoint is not eutopia-by-honing but empire-by-honing: standardized values, surveillance, and punitive capacity because those are what win competitions. Failure state outcome: you reproduce the worst historical pattern at astronomical scale: durable hegemonies justified as “coordination,” with dissent treated as defectors.

9. [The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: the essay’s key decision cruxes depend on whether the “correct moral view” is bounded/unbounded, aggregates goods/bads jointly/separately, and how heavily bads weigh (3.4). Failure mechanism: none of these are operationalized; you don’t give a computable value functional, a method to detect bounds, or any reason a post-AGI optimizer wouldn’t just pick the representation that favors its bargaining position. Attack vector: Agent A declares their value theory “unbounded below with separate aggregation,” then uses your own logic (“even small threats eat expected value”) to demand infinite concession as the only rational response. Consequence: your taxonomy becomes a bargaining weapon: whoever claims the most fragility or the most extreme bad-weighting wins by forcing everyone else into Pascal-mugging dynamics. Failure state outcome: negotiation collapses into metaethical fraud where declared axiologies, not actual welfare, determine resource allocation—maximizing extortion, not value.

10. [The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: “scenario (3) is higher-impact to act on than scenario (1), so don’t power-seek” (section 5). Failure mechanism: you assume marginal influence scales smoothly with “1 billionth of global power” arithmetic, but in real strategic environments influence is thresholded—control of a single chokepoint (compute, enforcement layer, contract court, identity registry) dominates all your fractional calculations. Attack vector: Agent A ignores your advice, power-seeks precisely for the chokepoint, then sets the bargaining protocol, the contract semantics, and the definition of “threat,” converting everyone else’s altruism into a resource they can tax. Consequence: your attempt to defuse power-seeking becomes an own-goal: it selects for unilateralists while persuading potential countervailing actors to stand down. Failure state outcome: a small number of defectors seize protocol-level power, and your envisioned pluralistic moral trade world becomes a single-stack sovereignty—one that can cheaply simulate “compromise” while locking in its own values forever.
