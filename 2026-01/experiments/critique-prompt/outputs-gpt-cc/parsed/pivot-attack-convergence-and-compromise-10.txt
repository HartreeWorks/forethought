“The ‘10 in N’ Guess Breaks the Mechanism” (attacks Pivot 1/2: the paper’s implicit quantitative step that the correct view will control a nontrivial share of resources among linear/non-discounting agents, enabling meaningful bargaining outcomes). The essay offers a rough heuristic (“if 1 in N are altruistic, maybe ~10 in N among linear preferences”), but the trade-rescues-flourishing story is extremely sensitive to this share: in Nash bargaining with poor outside options, a tiny minority gets squeezed toward zero when opponents have linear, non-satiating preferences and can coordinate. Moreover, the paper itself argues that abundance pushes *more* agents toward linear, non-altruistic objectives (collector’s items, positional goods, ideology), which can massively dilute the AM‑convergent share right when bargaining power matters most. If the correct moral view’s power share is orders of magnitude smaller than the heuristic (because power selection disfavors it, and linear self-interested views explode in number), then “partial AM‑convergence + trade” no longer yields mostly-great futures; it yields token concessions at best, returning expected flourishing toward the low baseline. If this objection holds, the paper would need either (i) a model where even vanishing minorities can secure large concessions (credible exit, veto, or enforcement), or (ii) a stronger argument that moral truth/motivation correlates with strategic advantage so the correct view captures a large initial endowment rather than bargaining for scraps.
