[The Moral Parliament Dissenter] The paper’s scoring variable—_Flourishing_ as “percentage of what it might be” (introduction, conclusion)—quietly presupposes a commensurable cardinal value measure across radically different axiologies, then uses that to argue that compromise can preserve “most value.” The failure mode is not abstract metaethics; it’s operational: once you allow population ethics, welfare theories, and bounded/unbounded value to vary (3.4), your “mostly-great” threshold becomes undefined because some views treat any nonzero amount of certain bads as lexically decisive, while others treat any finite shortfall from the maximum as catastrophic. Concretely, the same post-trade world can be “95% flourishing” on one aggregation rule and “worse than extinction” on another, which the essay itself gestures at when discussing separate aggregation and unbounded below (3.4) but then continues to reason in a single scalar. The consequence is that the paper’s headline reassurance—“expected value is not barely above 0”—is not supported unless you first win a contested argument about intertheoretic comparisons and aggregation, which the essay never supplies. If this objection holds, the paper’s quantitative updates are artifacts of an unargued moral arithmetic, not insights about the future.
