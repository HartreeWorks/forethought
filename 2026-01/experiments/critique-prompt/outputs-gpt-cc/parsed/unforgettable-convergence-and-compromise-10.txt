**“Cosmic Externality Lock-In”**: The paper argues that **resource division and bargaining** implies **multiple moral coalitions can each approach near-best futures**, because **their projects can largely be pursued on disjoint resources with minimal interference**. But many high-stakes cosmic actions are irreversibly **coupled**: early colonization preempts others’ options, large-scale computation changes reachable matter/energy states, astro-engineering alters observability and navigation, and some strategies (including defense against threats) rationally demand first-mover advantage that changes the baseline for Nash bargaining. Even if everyone intends to trade, the incentive is to take irreversible actions first to improve one’s disagreement point—making “trade later” dominated by “lock in now.” This isn’t a generic tragedy-of-the-commons claim; it attacks the essay’s central optimism that trade can occur “at the relevant period of bargaining,” because the relevant period may be **before** any stable bargaining table can exist. If this holds, the paper would need to treat **pre-bargaining irreversible moves** as the central determinant of outcomes and show a credible path to preventing preemptive lock-in without already assuming the sort of convergence or shared governance the paper elsewhere doubts.
