In **§2.2.1** you argue present agreement is mostly “low-hanging fruit” and will “*break down… as we max out on instrumentally valuable goods*,” with hedonism vs preference-satisfaction diverging under optimization. **Attack type: Hidden parameter (psychological/technological plasticity).** The divergence story assumes people will keep endorsing their *current* welfare theories under post-AGI choice, but the post-AGI setting you describe also allows direct editing of preferences, meta-preferences, and reflectivity—so the key parameter is whether agents choose to stabilize welfare-theory pluralism or *converge on a negotiated common currency* to reduce conflict/transaction costs. There’s a plausible world where, precisely because optimization makes divergence costly, actors voluntarily adopt “interoperability standards” for value (e.g., mutually legible preference representations, welfare-construction protocols), keeping agreement high even at the top of the list. If this holds, your step from “optimization power increases” to “moral agreement breaks down” fails unless you model the incentive to standardize/merge values. You’d need to add an explicit argument that value-standardization is infeasible or dominated by factional lock-in, rather than presuming divergence as the default.
