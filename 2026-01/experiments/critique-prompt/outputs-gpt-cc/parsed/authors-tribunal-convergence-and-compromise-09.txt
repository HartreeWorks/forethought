**“Threat Sensitivity as a Dominant, Unquantified Driver”** — The essay argues that executed threats can “easily eat into” expected value and might even make futures “worse than extinction” (§3.3–§3.4), and then uses that to recommend prioritizing threat prevention. The failure mechanism is that the conclusion is doing expected-value arithmetic without any handle on base rates, tractability, or equilibrium prevalence of threats once advanced agents can precommit, self-modify, and strategically signal; depending on those parameters, “threat world” could be vanishingly rare or overwhelmingly dominant. Because the essay treats threats as both under-researched and potentially value-dominating, its practical and evaluative conclusions become extremely sensitive to a parameter it explicitly does not estimate. If this objection holds, the paper would need to either bound the threat prevalence with argument/data or else downgrade several downstream claims (including the relative optimism about trade and the prioritization suggestions) to explicitly conditional statements.
