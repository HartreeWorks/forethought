> Power selects for ruthlessness and value drift, so the morally motivated minority the paper needs for trade probably doesn't survive the competitive filter to actually control pivotal assets like compute.

“The Billionaire Filter” (attacks Pivot 1: that “some meaningful fraction” of power-holders will exhibit partial AM‑convergence—i.e., converge on the correct moral view and be motivated to spend most resources on the good *de dicto*). The paper’s trade-based optimism requires that at least ~10⁻⁶ of *power-weighted* agents both (a) care about the good *de dicto* and (b) survive competitive selection long enough to matter at the bargaining moment. But many real selection mechanisms for power (ruthlessness, coalition-management, secrecy, willingness to take extreme risks, and tolerance for value drift in pursuit of influence) systematically screen out agents who would later hand resources to “the good overall,” especially once AGI systems can optimize for influence acquisition. If the AM‑convergent tail is drastically thinner among those who control pivotal assets (compute, enforcement, launch capacity) than among the general population, then the “moral trade minority” is absent where it counts, and the expected flourishing reverts toward the “no easy eutopia ⇒ near-zero” baseline the essay is trying to escape. If this objection holds, the paper would need an argument that *institutions or AI alignment* make moral motivation positively correlated with winning (or at least with retaining veto/exit options), rather than negatively correlated.
