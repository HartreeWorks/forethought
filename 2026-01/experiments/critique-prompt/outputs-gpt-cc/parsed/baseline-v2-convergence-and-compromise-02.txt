"Overextended Analogies to Flight and Natural Selection" — The introduction uses powered flight and convergent evolution as evidence that humans/future agents might “hone in” on a mostly-great future even if it is a narrow target. But those examples work because there is an externally enforced selection criterion (aerodynamic lift; reproductive fitness) that reliably penalizes failure and rewards incremental improvement. The paper later acknowledges that ethics lacks a comparable feedback signal, yet it still relies on the motivational pull of “design” and “honing in” as a live possibility. This is a weak inference: the existence of narrow targets that are routinely hit under strong selection pressure does not support hitting narrow targets without such pressure. The analogy therefore risks smuggling in precisely what is disputed—an effective, shared optimizing criterion for “the good.”
