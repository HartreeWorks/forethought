The inference “if realism is true, the correct moral view is probably very weird/alien relative to current preferences” is under-argued and may be question-begging. Many realist views (e.g., Cornell realism, naturalist realism) are compatible with substantial continuity between evolved social preferences and moral truth, so alienness does not straightforwardly follow from realism.
