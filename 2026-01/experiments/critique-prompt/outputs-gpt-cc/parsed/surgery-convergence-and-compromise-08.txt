A key action-guiding inference is that **preventing executed threats is a top priority, potentially more important than many other considerations, because threats can annihilate value across many axiologies.** **Attack type: Causal reversal.** Many plausible “threat-prevention” implementations (credible global enforcement, omnipresent monitoring, centralized sanction capacity) increase the payoff to capturing that enforcement layer, which can accelerate zero-sum competition over the very institution meant to suppress extortion and thereby raise the probability of catastrophic conflict or oppressive lock-in. In such a world, stronger anti-threat institutions *increase* expected disvalue by making the control point more pivotal, even if they reduce baseline extortion. If this critique holds, the paper’s recommendation to heavily prioritize threat prevention is not monotone; it requires an explicit comparison between “extortion disvalue avoided” and “centralization/contestability risk introduced,” otherwise the proposed lever may worsen the outcome it targets.
