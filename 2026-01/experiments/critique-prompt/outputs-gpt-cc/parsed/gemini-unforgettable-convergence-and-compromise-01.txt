“Your ‘narrow island’ is a mirage because the crew can move the island.” The paper’s load-bearing metaphor treats “mostly-great futures” as a fixed target in an objective space, like flight or an island, that selection or design can hone in on. But in your own setup, post‑AGI agents can self-modify, adopt constrained reflection, or pick advisors that hard-code preferred starting points—so the “target” is endogenous to the optimization process, not an external objective. Once the target moves with the optimizer, “honing in” ceases to be evidence of getting it right; it becomes evidence only of locking in whatever the optimizer chose to want. This isn’t patchable by tweaking the analogy, because the entire argumentative shape (narrow target + optimization ⇒ plausible success) depends on target fixedness. If you try to defend by asserting a “true” target (moral realism), you immediately contradict later reliance on pluralism/trade and reintroduce the motivation gap you already concede is fatal.
