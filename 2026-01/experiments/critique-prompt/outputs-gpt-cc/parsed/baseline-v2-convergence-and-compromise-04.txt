> Even if moral realism is true, that doesn't mean moral truth must be alien to human psychology—many realist traditions predict significant overlap with what already motivates us.

"A Non Sequitur from Realism to ‘Weirdness’ and Demotivation" — In 2.4.1 the author argues that if moral realism is true, the correct moral view is “likely” to be alien and distant from human preferences, which then makes widespread motivation unlikely. That step is not established: realism does not entail that moral truth is far from human motivational structures, and many realists (e.g., certain naturalist or neo-Aristotelian views) would predict substantial overlap between moral facts and human flourishing psychology. Moreover, the move from “could be motivationally demanding” to “most will avoid learning or believing it” relies on speculative psychology about information avoidance that is not defended. Even if some people avoid moral information, it does not follow that the relevant future decision-makers (who may be selected for curiosity, reflectiveness, or institutional role morality) will do so. The paper’s pessimism here depends on contestable empirical and philosophical assumptions about the content of moral truths and the dynamics of moral motivation.
