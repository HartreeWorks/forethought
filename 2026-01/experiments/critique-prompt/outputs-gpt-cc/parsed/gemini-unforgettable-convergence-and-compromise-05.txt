“Vacuous truth: ‘accurate convergence’ is either impossible (anti-realism) or motivationally toxic (realism), so the thesis reduces to ‘good happens if people want good.’” Section 2.4 tries to be meta-ethically ecumenical, but the structure is a trap of your own making: under anti-realism you concede there is no objective target to converge to, and under realism you argue the target is likely alien and demotivating (or avoided via motivated ignorance under internalism). That means WAM-convergence is either incoherent as “accuracy” (anti-realism) or self-negating as “motivation” (realism), leaving your optimistic scenario resting on a conditional that cannot stably obtain. The paper then proceeds as if WAM is a meaningful benchmark and treats failure to reach it as contingent rather than conceptual. This isn’t a definitional quibble; it means the central partition of possibilities (WAM / partial AM+trade / nobody aims) is built on a predicate that dissolves when you inspect it with the very meta-ethics you invoke. If you defend by redefining “accuracy” pragmatically (e.g., “endorsed by ideal reflection”), you reopen the free-parameter explosion you used to argue convergence is unlikely, so you’ve just moved the impossibility sign one step back.
