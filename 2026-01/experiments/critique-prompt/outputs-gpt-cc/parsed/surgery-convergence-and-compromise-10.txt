The opening move against “extreme pessimism” relies on the analogy-driven load-bearing claim that **even if mostly-great futures are a narrow target (“no easy eutopia”), deliberate honing (like flight design/evolution) can still make them reasonably likely.** **Attack type: Reference class failure.** In the flight and natural selection analogies, the optimizing process has a dense, local feedback signal tightly coupled to the target (lift, reproduction); but for “mostly-great futures,” the paper itself emphasizes that the target is metaethically contested, high-dimensional, and may lack shared evaluative feedback—so the search process is more like optimizing a proxy under distribution shift than like aerodynamics. In such domains, optimization commonly converges on **Goodharted attractors** (stable proxy-maxima) rather than the narrow “true objective” set, which undermines the very lesson the analogy is meant to teach. If this critique holds, the paper’s initial deflation of the “expected value barely above 0” inference loses its main intuitive support, and the subsequent optimism would need to rest on concrete mechanisms (institutions, bargaining, enforcement) rather than on the general claim that “narrow targets can still be hit.”
