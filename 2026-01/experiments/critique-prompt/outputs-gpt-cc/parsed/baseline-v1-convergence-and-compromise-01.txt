The paper relies heavily on analogies (flight evolution, metal shaping, sailing to an island) to rebut pessimism about “narrow targets,” but it never shows that the relevant structural similarities actually hold. In particular, biological evolution and engineered design succeed via clear selection criteria and feedback loops, whereas “the good” is precisely what is disputed and may not supply a comparable objective gradient for optimization.
