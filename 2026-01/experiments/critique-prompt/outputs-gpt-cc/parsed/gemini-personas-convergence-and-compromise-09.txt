[The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: the essay’s key decision cruxes depend on whether the “correct moral view” is bounded/unbounded, aggregates goods/bads jointly/separately, and how heavily bads weigh (3.4). Failure mechanism: none of these are operationalized; you don’t give a computable value functional, a method to detect bounds, or any reason a post-AGI optimizer wouldn’t just pick the representation that favors its bargaining position. Attack vector: Agent A declares their value theory “unbounded below with separate aggregation,” then uses your own logic (“even small threats eat expected value”) to demand infinite concession as the only rational response. Consequence: your taxonomy becomes a bargaining weapon: whoever claims the most fragility or the most extreme bad-weighting wins by forcing everyone else into Pascal-mugging dynamics. Failure state outcome: negotiation collapses into metaethical fraud where declared axiologies, not actual welfare, determine resource allocation—maximizing extortion, not value.
