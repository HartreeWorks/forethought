> Today's billionaire giving patterns are a poor proxy for post-AGI altruism because they're shaped by signaling, tax incentives, and institutional constraints that wouldn't exist in a radically different economic environment.

**“Billionaire Philanthropy as a Broken Proxy”** — In §2.3.2 the paper uses contemporary billionaire giving rates to “weakly suggest” that vastly increased wealth won’t increase altruistic spending shares, countering the diminishing-returns-to-selfish-consumption argument. The concrete failure mode is external validity: today’s billionaire philanthropy is entangled with signaling, tax strategy, reputational equilibria, institutional constraints, and limited action channels, none of which resembles a post-AGI environment with radically expanded feasible altruistic action and different social incentives. If the proxy is invalid, the essay loses one of its main empirical anchors against abundance-driven altruism, leaving the section’s net takeaway largely impressionistic. If this objection holds, the paper would need to either (i) defend why billionaire behavior is predictive under the relevant counterfactuals or (ii) substitute a better-matched evidence base/model (e.g., behavior under near-satiation in controlled settings, or agent-based simulations with expanded action spaces).
