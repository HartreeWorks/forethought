**Load-bearing claim:**
In **§2.3.2** you present an abundance-driven argument that weak altruistic preferences could dominate marginal spending because self-interested utility diminishes faster, then you rebut with billionaire philanthropy (~6% of income) as evidence against large shifts

**Attack type:**
Dominant alternative explanation

The billionaire data can be explained by *institutional and reputational constraints* (tax strategy, signaling equilibria, limited high-trust channels, fear of political backlash), not by stable preference curvature; so it’s a poor proxy for what agents do when (as you assume) “transaction costs are extremely small” and “iron-clad contracts” exist. In a post-AGI world with cheap verification and low coordination cost, the same underlying preferences could yield much higher altruistic fractions without any change in curvature. If this holds, your use of today’s philanthropy to downweight the abundance-to-altruism channel is not load-bearing evidence; it’s confounded by missing institutions you elsewhere assume away. You’d need to either (i) justify why those constraints persist post-AGI, or (ii) drop the billionaire comparison and replace it with a model of altruistic allocation under your own post-AGI assumptions.
