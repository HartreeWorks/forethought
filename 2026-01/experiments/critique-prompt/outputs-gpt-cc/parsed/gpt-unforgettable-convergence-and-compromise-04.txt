**"The Self-Modification Bargaining Arms Race"**: Your optimism about trade implicitly assumes bargainers arrive with more-or-less stable preferences and that “iron-clad contracts” just reduce transaction costs, but in the post-AGI world you describe, agents can self-modify to become better bargainers. The inference being attacked is: “With enough delegation and enforceable contracts, gains from moral trade will be widely realized.” Mechanism: if bargaining outcomes depend on threat credibility and disagreement points, then agents get leverage by (i) self-modifying into extreme, non-compromising utility functions, (ii) burning bridges to make refusal costly, and (iii) adopting lexicographic/linear-in-resources values you already flag as worst for compromise—turning “more rational contracting” into “more credible brinkmanship.” If this objection holds, you need to build the trade story around incentive-compatible anti-commitment norms or institutions (e.g., enforceable bans on preference self-mod for leverage, or bargaining solutions that penalize manufactured disagreement points), otherwise the very capabilities you invoke to enable trade select against compromise.
