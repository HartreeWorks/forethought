**Load-bearing claim:**
The trade pathway leans on the claim that **large gains from moral trade remain available in technologically mature societies, aided by low transaction costs and “iron-clad contracts.”**

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

This implicitly treats “contract completeness/enforceability” as near-binary (either iron-clad or not), but the feasibility of iron-clad contracts is highly sensitive to parameters the paper doesn’t integrate into the optimism: verifiability of internal states (did you really instantiate happy digital minds?), detectability of side-channels (did you create hidden suffering elsewhere?), and the cost of continuous auditing across light-speed-separated domains. Small degradations in verifiability can flip trade from positive-sum to adverse-selection-dominated, where only agents willing to cheat accept “moral” contracts. If this critique holds, the paper’s compromise optimism needs to be re-grounded in a **specific enforcement/auditing architecture**; otherwise “low transaction costs” is not a stable support for expecting realized gains from trade.
