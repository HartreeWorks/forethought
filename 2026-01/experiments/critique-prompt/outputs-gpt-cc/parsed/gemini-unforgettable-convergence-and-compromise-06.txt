“Your ‘abundance ⇒ altruism’ mechanism predicts the opposite once self-modification is allowed.” The diminishing marginal utility story in 2.3.2 relies on stable preference curvature: people eventually satisfy selfish wants and then allocate margin to altruism. But you also emphasize post‑AGI agents can change their nature dramatically; in that world, an agent who wants to remain selfish can simply edit their utility function to keep selfish returns linear/convex, ensuring they never “run out” of self-interested marginal value. Your own examples (collector’s shrines, positional rivalry, copies of oneself) already gesture at exactly these convexifiers, and abundance makes self-modification cheaper, not harder. So the mechanism that is supposed to create moral breathing room actually creates an arms race in preference hardening, where the agents least inclined to share can immunize themselves against diminishing returns and outcompete. If you defend by saying “most won’t self-modify that way,” you’re back to relying on motivational convergence or benign cultural selection—again, the thing you argued we shouldn’t expect.
