[The “Local-First” Policymaker — Incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift] Target claim: the illustrative “split the cosmos” bargain—Milky Way common-sense utopia, other galaxies total utilitarian utopia—suggests trade can get everyone near-best by their lights even when one group is a minority (3.1). Failure mechanism: you assume enforceable territorial partition and stable property rights over interstellar resources, but any local power center has a standing incentive to renege once it becomes technologically dominant, because the future value of defection dwarfs any earlier gains from cooperation. The more “iron-clad” the bargain, the more you reward whichever side can manipulate identity/continuity and claim they are the contract’s legitimate successor after self-modification, mergers, or copying—classic renegotiation under changing players, except now “players” can fork. Consequence: your flagship compromise example is dynamically inconsistent: it looks cooperative in a static snapshot, but in any plausible sequential game it induces preemptive militarization and early lock-in (your own “blockers”) rather than serene cosmic federalism.
