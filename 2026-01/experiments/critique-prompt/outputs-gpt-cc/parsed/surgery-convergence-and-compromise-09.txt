The “which scenarios are highest-stakes” section leans on the load-bearing claim that **one should act more on scenario (3) (broad convergence) than scenario (1) (almost no AM-convergence), because marginal actions are higher impact in (3) than personal power-seeking is in (1).** **Attack type: Parameter sensitivity.** This argument is extremely sensitive to the assumed elasticity of “Surviving” and “Flourishing” to individual action (the paper uses illustrative one-part-in-100k / one-part-in-a-million comparisons), but in worlds with high institutional inertia or fast takeoff, the true elasticities may be orders of magnitude lower—while the elasticity of “who holds pivotal power” may be higher because small early advantages compound. Under that parameterization, the dominance flips: power-seeking in (1) can outrun marginal improvements in (3), and the paper’s practical upshot (“don’t infer power-seeking”) no longer follows from its own toy arithmetic. If this critique holds, the paper needs to justify its **comparative elasticities** with a model of takeoff timing, leverage points, and compounding dynamics, not just illustrative ratios.
