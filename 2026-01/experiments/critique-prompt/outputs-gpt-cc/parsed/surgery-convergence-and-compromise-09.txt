> The argument's conclusion hinges on assumed elasticities of collective action versus personal power—swap in plausible fast-takeoff parameters where early advantages compound, and the paper's own arithmetic flips to favour power-seeking.

**Load-bearing claim:**
one should act more on scenario (3) (broad convergence) than scenario (1) (almost no AM-convergence), because marginal actions are higher impact in (3) than personal power-seeking is in (1)

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

This argument is extremely sensitive to the assumed elasticity of “Surviving” and “Flourishing” to individual action (the paper uses illustrative one-part-in-100k / one-part-in-a-million comparisons), but in worlds with high institutional inertia or fast takeoff, the true elasticities may be orders of magnitude lower—while the elasticity of “who holds pivotal power” may be higher because small early advantages compound. Under that parameterization, the dominance flips: power-seeking in (1) can outrun marginal improvements in (3), and the paper’s practical upshot (“don’t infer power-seeking”) no longer follows from its own toy arithmetic. If this critique holds, the paper needs to justify its **comparative elasticities** with a model of takeoff timing, leverage points, and compounding dynamics, not just illustrative ratios.
