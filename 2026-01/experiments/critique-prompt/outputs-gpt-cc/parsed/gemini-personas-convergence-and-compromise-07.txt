[The Adversarial Red-Teamer] Target claim: “memetically potent ideas” are just a blocker category (2.5) rather than an attack surface that dominates everything. Failure mechanism: once you tell smart actors that certain concepts function like “epistemic black holes,” you’ve published a blueprint for weaponized ideology—design a meme that (a) self-propagates, (b) disables rival reflection, and (c) justifies precommitment to threats. Attack vector: Agent A deploys a meme engineered to make adherents treat “WAM-convergence” as betrayal and “de dicto morality” as a cognitive hazard, then uses the resulting polarization to make threat equilibria (3.3) inevitable. Consequence: the environment becomes adversarial information warfare; “superintelligent advice” is co-opted as a delivery vehicle for value-malware rather than a clarifier of disagreement (2.3.1). Failure state outcome: reflection and bargaining degrade into memetic arms races, with wide-scale capture of minds and institutions—your convergence story dies before it starts.
