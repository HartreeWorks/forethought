“Your own evidence supports the opposite conclusion: ‘moral convergence’ historically tracks power, so future ‘convergence’ is just whoever controls persuasion tech.” You cite cases where values changed through conquest, state pressure, or coordination incentives (Mormon polygamy, abolition under British pressure, post‑WWII value shifts), and you treat this as a reason current agreement is shallow and contingent. But the reversal is damning: if convergence is primarily a function of coercion, memetic power, and institutional leverage, then post‑AGI “reflection” is not the driver of convergence—control over AI advisors, narrative tools, and enforcement is. That undermines both WAM (because it won’t track truth) and trade (because bargainers won’t be stable agents with fixed preferences; they’ll be targets of preference-shaping). In that world, the correct forecast is not “partial AM-convergence + bargains”; it’s “whoever wins the preference-shaping stack manufactures a pseudo-consensus,” making your optimism about negotiated pluralism naïve. If you defend by appealing to “reasonably good conditions,” you’re effectively assuming away the central technological fact you yourself emphasize: that persuasion and self-modification become astronomically powerful.
