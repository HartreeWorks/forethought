[The Empirical Hardliner — Measurement/identification failure] Target claim: in section 5 you argue we should “act much more on the assumption” of scenario (3) (broad AM-convergence) because the best actions have higher expected impact there, with toy numbers like “Surviving 80%” and “Flourishing 10%.” Failure mechanism: your argument depends on comparing tiny marginal effects (“one part in a hundred thousand,” “one part in a million”) across scenarios, but you never supply a measurement model for how any real intervention moves *Surviving* or *Flourishing*, nor a way to disentangle intervention impact from background trend in a post-AGI regime. Without identifiability, your comparison is arbitrary: you can always pick effect sizes that make “non-powerseeking” dominate “power-seeking,” or vice versa, because you’ve defined neither a unit of “power” (you use “1 billionth of global power”) nor an observable that tracks flourishing under moral uncertainty. Consequence: the paper’s main practical steering move—deprioritize power-seeking because scenario (3) dominates on impact—doesn’t follow from your own framework; it’s an intuition pump disguised as expected-value arithmetic, and a strategic reader can reject it without touching the rest of your analysis.
