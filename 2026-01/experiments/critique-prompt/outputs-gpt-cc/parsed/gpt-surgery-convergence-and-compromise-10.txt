In **§5** you argue we should “act much more on the assumption that we live in scenario (3)” because marginal impact is higher there, and you give a toy calculation comparing power-seeking in scenario (1) vs improving Surviving/Flourishing in scenario (3). **Attack type: Hidden parameter (intervention sign under scenario uncertainty).** The calculation assumes your non-powerseeking actions have positive expected effect specifically in scenario (3), but many plausible interventions (AI governance centralization, safety standards, value coordination institutions) can *increase the probability of scenario (1)* by homogenizing power and reducing pluralistic value discovery, or by creating single points of failure that make “no AM-convergence” catastrophic. In that world, optimizing for scenario (3) conditional impact can worsen the ex ante mixture by shifting probability mass toward the worst case, flipping your recommendation back toward robustness/power-diffusion rather than “assume (3).” If this holds, you need to reframe §5 around policy robustness across scenarios (how actions change scenario probabilities), not just conditional EV within a chosen scenario, and you’d have to revise the headline practical upshot away from “focus on (3)” unless you show your favored actions don’t increase scenario-(1) likelihood.
