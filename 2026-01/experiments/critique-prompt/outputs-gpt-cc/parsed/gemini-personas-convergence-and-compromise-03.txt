[The Second-Order Catastrophist] Target claim: preventing “value-destroying threats” is an overriding priority because small threat fractions can eat expected value (3.3–3.4). Failure mechanism: if you successfully build institutions that suppress threats across value systems, you’ve built the core primitives of an authoritarian universal censorship regime—because “threat” is not a crisp category and will be broadened to include ideological nonconformity, persuasion, and even research. Attack vector: a security bloc labels entire moral factions as “memetically potent epistemic black holes” (2.5) and uses your threat-prevention mandate to preemptively suppress them “for expected value reasons.” Consequence: you get stable, global thought-policing and value monoculture enforced by superintelligent monitoring, which is worse than the pluralistic conflict you were trying to manage. Failure state outcome: a locked-in surveillance state prevents both moral progress and escape routes, producing permanent stagnation (or permanent oppression) with the moral-justification veneer you supplied.
