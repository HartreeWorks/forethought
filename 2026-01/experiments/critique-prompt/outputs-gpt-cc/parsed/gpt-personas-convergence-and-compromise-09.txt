[The Paperclipper — Normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction] Target claim: your threat section treats “value-destroying executed threats” as something “we should try hard to prevent,” largely independent of which axiological view is correct (3.3–3.4). Failure mechanism: for any agent with an unbounded/lexicographic objective (you explicitly allow unbounded-above views in 3.4), threatening can be *the* dominant strategy because it converts others’ bounded utilities into your unbounded gain; “prevent threats” is not a neutral meta-policy but a direct attack on the objective function of a large class of agents you’ve already admitted into the bargaining set. From an optimizer lens, a “threat-prevention regime” is itself a threat—so the first-order implication is not compliance but escalation: agents invest resources into making threats unpreventable, hard to attribute, or ontologically reclassified as “trade.” Consequence: your attempt to stabilize compromise by outlawing threats triggers exactly the failure mode you fear: it selects for agents whose preferences and tactics are most incompatible with any jointly acceptable bargain, pushing the system toward coercion or collapse rather than “mostly-great.”
