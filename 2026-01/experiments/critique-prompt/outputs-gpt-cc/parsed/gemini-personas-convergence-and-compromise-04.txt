[The Empirical Hardliner] Target claim: “abundance + diminishing marginal utility” implies a larger share of resources will go to altruistic ends (2.3.2). Failure mechanism: your only empirical anchor is modern billionaire giving rates (≈6% of investment income), which you then extrapolate across a phase transition where consumption sets, identity, and hedonic tech radically change—without a causal model. Attack vector: Agent A gets post-AGI “experience expansion” tech that creates new self-oriented utility channels with effectively linear returns (you even list copies-of-bliss and shrine-building), eliminating the diminishing-returns premise that props up altruistic spending. Consequence: abundance does not tilt budgets toward impartial good; it explodes the action space for selfish linear preferences and entrenches them. Failure state outcome: your optimism lever flips sign: more wealth yields more total selfish resource burn, not a late-game altruism switch.
