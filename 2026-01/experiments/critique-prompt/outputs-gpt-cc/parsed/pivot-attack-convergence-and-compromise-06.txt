> Credible precommitment to value-destruction gets instrumentally rewarded in bargaining, so threats scale through competitive dynamics rather than sadism, potentially swallowing the surplus that makes trade worthwhile.

“Extortion Is the Equilibrium, Not the Exception” (attacks Pivot 3: that executed value-destroying threats are likely to be small, or preventable enough that trade remains net-positive). The threats section admits thin literature and limited analysis, yet the essay’s optimistic update depends on threats not scaling to swallow most value—especially given the paper’s own admission that many axiologies are highly threat-sensitive. In bargaining games with commitment-capable agents, threats can be strategically *selected for*: an actor that can credibly precommit to “burn value you care about unless paid” can extract surplus, and competitive dynamics may favor adopting threat policies even if nobody intrinsically likes them (arms-race logic). If so, threats become pervasive not because agents are sadists, but because “being the kind of agent who threatens” is instrumentally rewarded, and superintelligence makes commitment and targeted harm cheaper. Once threats are common, the paper’s conclusion flips: partial AM‑convergence plus trade doesn’t yield mostly-great futures; it yields a future where large fractions of resources are diverted to hostage-taking and defensive spending, potentially driving expected flourishing toward zero or negative on the very moral-uncertainty grounds the essay emphasizes. To withstand this, the paper would need a more equilibrium-driven argument (not just plausibility talk) that stable norms/institutions can make “no threats” a robust attractor against unilateral deviations by commitment races.
