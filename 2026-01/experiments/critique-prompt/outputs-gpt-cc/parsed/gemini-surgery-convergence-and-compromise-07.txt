The trade-and-compromise optimism in 3.1–3.2 relies on a separability premise: that resources can be partitioned (galaxies, star systems, compute) so that different moral views can each get “near-best by their lights,” making trade massively positive-sum. A counterexample consistent with your own “weirder issues” list is that the dominant determinants of value are *global* rather than local—e.g., acausal trade commitments, simulation policies, universal security constraints, or irreversible cosmological engineering choices that impose externalities across all regions. Then “split the galaxies” fails: one group’s policy (say, creating vast numbers of simulated minds, or adopting a risky acausal bargaining stance, or implementing a universal ban on certain computations) changes the payoff landscape everywhere, so no clean partition exists and moral trade collapses into coercive constitutional design. If this critique holds, the paper must add and analyze explicit conditions for moral trades to exist (low externalities, enforceable boundaries, no global policy coupling), rather than treating resource divisibility as the default in cosmic settings.
