In **§2** you state: “*We’ll here assume that, given WAM-convergence, we will reach a mostly-great future*,” and even suggest “*even a global dictatorship could have a good chance*” under WAM-convergence. **Attack type: Countermodel.** Consider a world where the dictator and key technologists sincerely converge on the “right” moral view and are motivated de dicto, but governance is *epistemically brittle* under concentration: a few mistaken institutional choices (metric selection, delegation to advisors, security doctrine) create irreversible path dependence that blocks key components of the “mostly-great” target despite aligned intent. This breaks your inference that WAM-convergence is sufficient; it treats “major blockers” as exogenous while dictatorship itself is a blocker generator (reduced error-correction, suppressed dissent, adversarial selection of information). If this holds, you must either (i) make WAM-convergence include robust institutional properties (pluralism, corrigibility, redundancy), or (ii) stop using WAM-convergence as a near-sufficient condition and track the conditional failure probability from governance structure.
