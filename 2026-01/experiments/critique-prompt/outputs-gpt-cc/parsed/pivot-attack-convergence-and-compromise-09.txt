“Axiological Uncertainty Should Make You *More* Pessimistic Here” (attacks Pivot 3/4 combination: that, despite high uncertainty about boundedness/aggregation/negative-leaningness, the trade story still supports a substantial flourishing probability). In section 3.4 the essay itself notes that many plausible axiologies make even small executed-threat fractions catastrophic (bounded above but unbounded below; separate aggregation; heavy bad-weighting), and it also concedes deep uncertainty about which axiology is correct. But then the paper’s overall update still lands at “not near zero,” largely because trade seems promising—yet trade is exactly the scenario that creates many interfaces for threats and extortion, and thus is disproportionately punished by threat-sensitive axiologies. If you take the paper’s axiology menu seriously, adding trade may *increase* downside risk relative to simpler centralized or homogeneous-value worlds, because it multiplies strategic antagonists and threat channels. If that’s right, the argument “trade makes mostly-great futures plausible under moral uncertainty” fails: moral uncertainty pushes expected value back down (or makes it dominated by tail risks), undermining the paper’s core “anti-0% flourishing” conclusion. To fix this, the paper would need to explicitly compute (even qualitatively) how moral-uncertainty weights interact with the threat-proneness of pluralist bargaining worlds, rather than treating trade as broadly value-positive.
