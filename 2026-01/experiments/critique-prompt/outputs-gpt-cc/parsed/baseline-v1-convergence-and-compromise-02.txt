The central premise that “mostly-great futures are a very narrow target” is asserted rather than defended in this essay, yet many later inferences (especially about coincidence and the need for deliberate aiming) depend on it. Without a clearer metric of “mostly-great,” a model of the space of futures, and an argument for “narrowness,” the paper risks building a large superstructure on an undefended background assumption.
