The anti-realism argument in 2.4.2 leans on a “free parameters / astronomical haystack” lemma: without objective moral facts, idealization is underpowered, so reflective endpoints will diverge massively, hence WAM-convergence is unlikely. The unstated assumption is that the space of reflective equilibria is *not* shaped by convergent instrumental/strategic constraints (coordination, bargaining stability, acausal considerations the paper itself flags, etc.) that can create strong attractors even absent moral facts. A counter-model: suppose agents’ reflective procedures are chosen under self-modification pressures to avoid being Dutch-booked, exploited, or extorted; then many diverse starting points converge on a small set of stable bargaining norms (e.g., something close to impartial welfarism or broadly cooperative aggregation) because those norms are equilibrium-selection devices, not “moral truths.” In that world, anti-realism holds, individuals still choose their own idealization procedures, yet convergence is high precisely because non-convergent procedures are strategically dominated and get selected out. If this critique holds, the paper must either (i) argue that strategic/equilibrium attractors are too weak to concentrate reflective endpoints, or (ii) incorporate them as a separate “convergence mechanism” that can overpower the free-parameter divergence story.
