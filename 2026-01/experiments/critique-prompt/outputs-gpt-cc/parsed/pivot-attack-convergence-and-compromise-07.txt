“Anti-Threat Law Becomes a Hegemon or a Joke” (attacks Pivot 3: that a legal system preventing value-undermining threats could be “mutually agreeable and stable”). The essay gestures at the difficulty here, but its optimism implicitly assumes a workable middle: enough enforcement to suppress threats, without granting a single authority so much power that we’re back to the lock-in/concentration problem. In practice, anti-threat enforcement with teeth requires (i) broad surveillance/audit powers, (ii) credible sanctions, and (iii) jurisdiction across competing value blocs—each of which either centralizes authority (creating a de facto hegemon) or invites evasion (making the system toothless against the highest-stakes, most hidden threats). If enforcement centralizes, then the trade-based pluralist route to flourishing is replaced by “who aligns the enforcer,” reintroducing the narrow-target problem and undermining the paper’s optimism. If enforcement is toothless, then threats return and eat the gains from trade as in the previous objection. If this holds, the paper would need to argue for a specific institutional design (e.g., distributed, auditable enforcement with minimal discretionary power) that is stable under strategic adaptation by agents who benefit from reintroducing threats.
