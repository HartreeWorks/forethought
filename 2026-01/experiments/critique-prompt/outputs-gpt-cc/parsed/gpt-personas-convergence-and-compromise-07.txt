[The Moral Parliament Dissenter — Normative incoherence / value aggregation contradiction] Target claim: the paper repeatedly talks as if there is “the correct moral view,” then evaluates whether trade yields “the value of the world, on the correct moral view, after trade” (3.2), while also urging action under deep moral uncertainty (3.4–5). Failure mechanism: you mix two incompatible decision frames without noticing the contradiction: (a) a realist “correct-view” objective that makes compromise instrumentally justified only insofar as it serves that view, and (b) a moral-parliament “many views matter” frame that treats mutual gains as intrinsically policy-relevant. Under (a), giving galaxies to “easily-satiable” alien views (3.4) is just bribing moral error; under (b), your repeated reliance on “correctness” is question-begging and your threat analysis (3.3–3.4) can’t privilege any particular aggregation of goods/bads. Consequence: because your optimization target oscillates, your practical recommendations (e.g., prioritize preventing threats “even if costly,” 3.4) are not derivable from a stable axiology—an adversary (or a skeptical reader) can accept all your premises and reject your action-guidance as internally unlicensed.
