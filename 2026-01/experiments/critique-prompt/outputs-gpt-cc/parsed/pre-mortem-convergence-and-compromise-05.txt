"Preference Hardening as a Bargaining Technology" — The paper’s partial-AM-convergence-plus-trade optimism relied on actors being able to bargain and compromise using delegation and low transaction costs; this was adopted via automated negotiators that represented individuals and polities in perpetual moral bargaining. The broken mechanism was the unmodeled incentive to *engineer one’s own preferences* to improve bargaining position: negotiators that credibly refused compromise (because their principals self-modified into commitment types) systematically extracted better deals. The cascade went from a few hardliners winning, to imitation, to an arms race of “value rigidity” modifications, to a world where almost everyone had self-altered to become less tradeable, causing the bargain space to collapse and disputes to route into coercive adjudication or force. Instead of moral trade producing hybrid gains, moral trade selected for the least cooperative motivational architectures. The paper missed that in a world of editable minds, “willingness to compromise” is not an exogenous trait—it is an evolvable strategy under selection pressure from bargaining itself.
