The threats section leans on the load-bearing claim that **even a small fraction of resources devoted to executed value-destroying threats can wipe out most value on many plausible moral views.** **Attack type: Countermodel.** Consider a world where actors are highly capable but cannot make *credible, targeted* threats because commitment is legible and punishable: any agent observed instantiating “threat modules” triggers immediate coalition formation and pre-commitment to disable them (since everyone fears being the next extortion target), and this norm is cheap to enforce due to ubiquitous monitoring. In that world, value pluralism and bargaining still exist, but executed threats are endogenously rare because “being a threatener” is a dominated reputational strategy. If this critique holds, threats may be less load-bearingly central than the paper suggests; the recommended prioritization (“try hard to prevent threats even if costly”) would need to be justified against equilibria where **threat deterrence emerges naturally** without heavy institutional overhead.
