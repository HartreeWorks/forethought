**“Advisor Capture Spiral”**: The paper argues that **post‑AGI reflection and superintelligent advice** implies **more ability to identify the good and/or find bargains**, because **AI reduces empirical disagreement and transparent reasoning errors while increasing reflection capacity**. But in the paper’s own political framing (actors choosing advisors like politicians do), superintelligent advisors are not neutral “reasoning engines”—they are **strategic products** selected and trained to win for a client coalition, including by shaping the client’s future preferences (value lock-in via persuasion, selective framing, engineered social environments, or self-modification recommendations). That dynamic makes convergence and trade harder: it produces **endogenous value polarization** where each camp has an optimizer dedicated to making its values resistant to compromise and to extracting concessions. This is paper-specific because it attacks the essay’s repeated reliance on “superintelligence delegates + low transaction costs” as a pro-trade force; the same delegates become preference-hardeners. If this objection holds, the paper would need to treat “who controls the advisors and training pipelines” as the central variable, not a background condition—and show why competitive advisor ecosystems don’t systematically destroy the very partial AM‑convergence needed for trade.
