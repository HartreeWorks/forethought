**"Threat Research as a Threat Multiplier"**: You argue threats can destroy most value and should be a major priority, but you also note that even learning about threats can increase their incidence; the paper nonetheless publicly supplies the conceptual template (“credibly commit to harm what the other values to extract concessions”). The inference being attacked is: “Raising salience of threat risk helps society prevent threats net-positive.” Step-by-step: publishing threat logic increases the population of actors who can recognize and operationalize extortion opportunities → early movers gain by deploying threats before counter-institutions exist → the baseline shifts from cooperative trade to preemptive deterrence and retaliation equilibria → the expected threat fraction rises precisely because your intervention succeeded at memetic spread. If this objection holds, you must treat the essay itself as an intervention requiring infohazard-aware design: either move key threat content behind controlled channels, or pair it with concrete, enforceable countermeasures (institutional, cryptographic, and normative) strong enough that dissemination doesn’t worsen the equilibrium.
