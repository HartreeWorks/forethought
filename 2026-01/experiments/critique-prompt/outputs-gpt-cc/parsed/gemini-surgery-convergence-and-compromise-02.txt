Section 2 repeatedly treats “WAM-convergence ⇒ mostly-great future” as near-axiomatic (“We’ll here assume that, given WAM-convergence, we will reach a mostly-great future”), which is a keystone dependency because it lets the paper focus on moral convergence rather than execution. The missing inference is the jump from *endorsing the good de dicto* to *implementing world-trajectory changes that actually realize it* in a setting full of strategic actors, complex indirect effects, and AI-mediated action. A counterexample that satisfies WAM-convergence: most powerful actors sincerely converge on a correct theory that (say) prioritizes digital welfare and non-coercion, but the only available action pathways are via large-scale automated systems whose behavior is brittle to specification and adversarial manipulation; the result is “values are right, control is wrong,” producing lock-in to a mediocre equilibrium or even a catastrophe by the convergers’ own lights. This breaks the paper’s main decomposition, because WAM-convergence would not be sufficient even under “reasonably good conditions” unless “good conditions” smuggles in near-complete control/verification of implementation. The revision needed is to explicitly add (and then analyze) a second load-bearing premise: that there exist reliable institutions/technical controls that translate de dicto motivation into correct large-scale outcomes under adversarial pressure, rather than assuming it away.
