> Even if some people converge on the right values, they'd need to hold enough strategic power during the lock-in window for trade to work—and realistic power distributions suggest they probably won't.

**“Partial AM-Convergence + Power Distribution Gap”** — The core hopeful pathway is “partial AM-convergence” (as high as ≥1-in-a-million) plus trade (§3), but the essay simultaneously flags concentration of power (§3.5) and early lock-in (§2.5) as major blockers without integrating them into the viability of the pathway. The failure mechanism is that the relevant quantity is not the fraction of people who AM-converge, but the fraction of *decisive strategic control* held by AM-convergers during the narrow time window when lock-in occurs; in many plausible post-AGI transitions, that share could be far below 10⁻⁶ even if AM-convergers exist, making trade moot. By not connecting partial convergence rates to plausible power-law distributions of control, the paper risks overstating the probability mass of its favored route to “mostly-great.” If this objection holds, the paper would need to explicitly model (even at a back-of-the-envelope level) the joint distribution of (AM-convergence incidence × control concentration × timing of lock-in) and show that the trade pathway remains live under realistic tails.
