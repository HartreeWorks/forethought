“Galaxies Aren’t Divisible Like Coins” (attacks Pivot 2: that moral trade can approximate “you take these galaxies, we take those,” delivering near-best outcomes for multiple views). The paper’s flagship intuition—partition resources or find hybrid goods—quietly assumes separability: that one group’s optimal use of its share doesn’t impose large negative externalities on others’ value functions. But in spacefaring settings, many actions are non-separable: (i) security races (preemption, surveillance, weapon placement) create cross-border risk; (ii) irreversible cosmological engineering (star lifting, black-hole computing, conversion to dense substrates) changes the shared environment; and (iii) moral views that care about “what exists anywhere” (e.g., no suffering anywhere, preservation anywhere) are violated by the other bloc’s local choices, not merely by “taking some resources.” If separability fails, then trade cannot simply “split the cosmos,” and compromise stops being a route to mostly-great futures—because each bloc’s pursuit creates global disvalue for the other, shrinking the feasible Pareto frontier. If this holds, the paper must replace its partition/hybrid-goods optimism with a detailed account of which high-stakes goods/bads are actually separable under physics, enforcement, and epistemic constraints.
