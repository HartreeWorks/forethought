> Moral realism doesn't necessarily lead to "alien" values—many realist frameworks predict moral truths that largely overlap with our evolved social instincts, just with local corrections like greater impartiality.

**"The realism → ‘alien morality’ inference is weak"**  
The argument that moral realism implies a correct morality that will strike most agents as “weird and alien,” hence non-motivating, is not well supported. Many realist pictures (naturalist realism, Cornell realism, constructivist-leaning realism) predict substantial continuity with evolved social preferences because moral facts are partly about flourishing, cooperation, and reasons grounded in agency. Even if the full truth is revisionary, it may be only locally revisionary (e.g., more impartiality, more scope sensitivity) rather than radically alien. The paper treats “alienness” as a default expectation, but that’s a controversial sociological claim about what the moral truth would be like. If realism instead predicts relatively *nearby* truths, WAM-convergence becomes more plausible than the paper suggests.
