**Load-bearing claim:**
In **§2.4.1 (realism)** you argue: if realism/internalism, people “*prefer not to learn facts that end up motivating them*,” and if externalism, they may learn but not act—either way WAM-convergence is unlikely

**Attack type:**
Reversal

The same internalism premise can imply the opposite: if moral belief is intrinsically motivating, actors may *precommit to exposure* (or build institutions that force exposure) precisely to harness motivation as a self-control technology, analogous to binding oneself to diets or addiction treatment—especially in a world of advanced commitment devices you later rely on for “iron-clad contracts.” Moreover, “not wanting to learn” is unstable when competitive selection rewards groups that adopt motivating truth-tracking moral beliefs (they coordinate better, reduce internal defection, and may win conflicts). If this holds, your inference “internalism → avoidance → low convergence” is not directionally robust; internalism could increase both convergence and motivation. You’d need to specify conditions under which avoidance dominates precommitment/selection (e.g., privacy, low intergroup competition, easy self-deception) rather than treating avoidance as the default.
