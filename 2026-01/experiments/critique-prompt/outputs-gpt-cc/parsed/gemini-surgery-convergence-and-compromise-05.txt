Section 2.3.2’s abundance argument turns on a key causal step: extreme wealth pushes marginal spending toward preferences with slow diminishing returns, and many such preferences can be non-altruistic (linear collector/status/shrine preferences), so abundance does not strongly imply altruistic dominance. The counterexample is a post‑AGI economy where *status competition and positional goods collapse* because replication, anonymity, and preference-editing make relative status unstable, while auditability and norm enforcement make reputational/contractual standing depend on meeting impartial welfare constraints; then the surviving slow-diminishing preferences are precisely pro-social/constraint-respecting ones, and abundance drives a huge share of resources into what looks altruistic. This respects your premise (abundance changes marginal allocation) but reverses your conclusion (abundance becomes a strong driver of altruistic use of resources). If this critique holds, the paper must revise the “linear non-altruism is natural” inference by conditioning on equilibrium properties of post‑AGI social status, enforcement, and preference markets, rather than extrapolating from billionaire philanthropy under today’s incentives.
