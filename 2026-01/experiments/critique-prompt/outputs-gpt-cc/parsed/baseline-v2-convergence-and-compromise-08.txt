> Moral trade between future agents assumes values can be neatly partitioned across resources, but many ethical frameworks care about global properties that make spatial "you take these galaxies" splits incoherent.

"Assumptions About Moral Trade and Contracting Are Too Optimistic" — The trade story in section 3 relies on future agents being able to identify Pareto-improving moral deals, enforce them (via “iron-clad contracts”), and avoid breakdown from mistrust and strategic behavior. But even with strong enforcement, bargaining outcomes depend on baselines, outside options, and the distribution of coercive power—features the paper acknowledges later but does not integrate into its optimism about “enormous gains from trade.” Many moral views are not representable as stable, tradeable utility functions (e.g., deontological constraints, sacred values, lexical priorities), making “compromise” conceptually incoherent rather than merely difficult. The paper also assumes separability of resource domains (e.g., “you take galaxies A–Z, we take the rest”), but in many plausible futures, values depend on global properties (total population, uniqueness, coordination, avoiding certain kinds of beings anywhere), which defeats spatial partitioning. If those complications are common, then the paper’s main “more realistic and promising” route to mostly-great futures becomes far less robust.
