“Resource-splitting is a hidden crux: most moral views you cite are not separable, so ‘galaxies for everyone’ doesn’t buy peace.” Your flagship compromise picture—different groups take different galaxies and each gets near-best-by-their-lights—assumes values are localizable and that disvalue doesn’t arise merely from others doing their thing elsewhere. But many of the very disputes you highlight (worship one deity vs another, threats, deontic constraints, integrity/complicity, rights violations, population ethics, treatment of created minds) are globally sensitive: a view can assign massive negative value to the existence of certain practices anywhere, not just in “my region.” Once you admit negative-leaning axiologies and heavy bad-weighting (which you do), separability fails catastrophically, and trade no longer has positive-sum structure—it becomes a fight over universal injunctions. This isn’t solvable by “finding hybrid goods,” because non-separability is precisely the claim that hybrids don’t compensate for violations. If you defend by restricting to separable welfarist views, you’ve amputated most of the moral uncertainty you use to motivate the paper’s framework and made your earlier “no easy eutopia” premise far less credible.
