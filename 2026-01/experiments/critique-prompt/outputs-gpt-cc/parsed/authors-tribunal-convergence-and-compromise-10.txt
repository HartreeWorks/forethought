> The action guidance rests on made-up numbers that could justify any strategy, and it wrongly treats the scenarios as fixed backdrops rather than things our choices can shift.

**“Scenario (3) Action Guidance Uses Arbitrary Counterfactuals”** — In §5 the paper argues we should act more as if we are in broad-convergence scenario (3) rather than near-zero convergence scenario (1), partly because “best actions are higher-impact” in (3) and because stakes may be lower in (1). The failure mechanism is that the numerical comparison (power shares, “one hundred millionth as much value,” 80% survive/10% flourish) is not derived from the essay’s earlier analysis and can be tuned to make almost any strategy look best; meanwhile, the argument ignores that interventions can change which scenario obtains (e.g., institution-building might increase convergence, while power-seeking might decrease it), so the scenarios are not decision-externals. If this objection holds, the paper would need a decision-theoretic treatment where actions affect the probability of (1)/(3), and where “impact” is not illustrated by free-floating numbers but linked to the paper’s earlier causal claims about convergence, trade feasibility, and blockers.
