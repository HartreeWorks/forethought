**"Partition-ability as a Hidden Crux"**: The trade-and-compromise optimism depends on an unstated premise that cosmic resources can be cleanly partitioned into largely independent domains (“you get other galaxies; we get the Milky Way”) without major cross-domain externalities. The inference being attacked is: “Moral trade can approximate near-best futures for multiple views via splitting or hybridizing resource use.” Step-by-step: advanced agents’ projects plausibly share deep physical couplings (computational substrate competition, gravitational/astroengineering side effects, information hazards, light-cone interference, and security externalities) → projects are no longer separable → every “partition” is a security and externality negotiation → bargaining reverts to a single coupled game where the default is strategic dominance, not mutual satisfaction. If this objection holds, you must explicitly model and solve the coupled-externalities case (including enforcement and safety constraints), or else restrict your optimism claims to an explicit regime where externalities are provably negligible and enforceable boundaries exist.
