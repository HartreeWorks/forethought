> The paper's case for focusing on broad convergence rests on circular reasoning—it weights scenarios by how much the author cares about them, then uses that weighting to justify ignoring the pessimistic cases where action might matter most.

"Section 5’s Decision-Theoretic ‘Focus on Scenario (3)’ Is Dubious" — The paper argues we should act more on the assumption of broad convergence (scenario 3) because actions are higher-impact there and because the author “cares more” about what happens in that scenario. But higher impact conditional on a scenario does not by itself justify prioritizing that scenario; what matters is expected value across credences, and the paper does not provide a principled rule for scenario-weighting under deep uncertainty. The second reason—caring more about scenario (3)—looks like an unstable preference that risks double-counting optimism: it makes the stakes endogenous to the scenario classification, which can rationalize ignoring pessimistic possibilities precisely when they are most concerning. Moreover, the illustrative power-seeking calculation assumes linearity between “fraction of power” and “fraction of value controlled,” a highly contestable mapping in lock-in and winner-take-all dynamics. As a result, the practical upshot section risks offering strategic advice that is not actually supported by the preceding analysis.
