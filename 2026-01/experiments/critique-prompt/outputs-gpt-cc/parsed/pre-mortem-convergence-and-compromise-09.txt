"Random-Walk Relativism Spillover" — The paper’s random-walk framing of moral reflection (and its emphasis that antirealism makes convergence unlikely) seeped into elite education and governance rhetoric as a caution against “moral overconfidence.” The mechanism that broke was motivational: public officials became less willing to enforce strong protections for entities with weak political voice (early digital workers, engineered animals), because doing so looked like illegitimate imposition of parochial values in a world where “reflection diverges anyway.” The cascade was gradual normalization of practices that many later judged to be atrocities, followed by explosive legitimacy backlash once affected groups gained representation and evidence of suffering became undeniable, destabilizing institutions and triggering retaliatory politics that wiped out hard-won cooperative norms. The paper missed how meta-ethical humility can mutate into enforcement nihilism in the hands of institutions that must act under uncertainty; the rhetorical framing changed default governance behavior even when decisionmakers privately held strong views.
