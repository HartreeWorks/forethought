A central pillar of the anti-WAM argument is: **under moral realism, the correct view is likely “alien,” so even if discovered it won’t be motivational (and internalists may avoid learning it).** **Attack type: Causal reversal.** “Alienness” can rationally increase rather than decrease motivation in a post-AGI setting because agents can treat moral truth as a coordination Schelling point: the *more* objective and “not just my tribe’s preferences” it seems, the more it becomes a focal basis for legitimacy, institutional design, and stable bargaining—especially when superintelligent advisors can certify arguments as robust across reflective procedures. The same evidence (“this conclusion is weird and not parochial”) can therefore support *stronger* uptake and compliance, not avoidance. If this critique holds, the realism branch no longer supports pessimism about motivational convergence; the paper’s overall downgrade of WAM-convergence would need to be conditional on a much more specific story about why “alien but certified” moral truths fail to become coordination anchors.
