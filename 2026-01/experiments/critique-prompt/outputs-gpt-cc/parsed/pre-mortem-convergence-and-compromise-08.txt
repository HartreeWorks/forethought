"High-Dimensional Veto Gridlock" — The essay’s picture of abundant superintelligent delegates making transaction costs “extremely small relative to the gains” led designers to formalize moral compromise as multi-stakeholder constraint satisfaction across countless micro-views (a constitutionalized “moral portfolio” requirement for megaprojects). The mechanism that broke was computational and institutional, not philosophical: as the number of protected value-constraints grew, feasible designs became sparse and proving compliance became more expensive than building anything, so actors optimized for *audit-passing proxies* rather than real goods. The cascade was paralysis in legitimate channels, followed by a shift of decisive action to entities willing to ignore the portfolio system (often private AGI operators outside the constitutional perimeter), which then set de facto standards through faits accomplis. The result was the opposite of trade-enabled pluralism: moral bureaucracy selected for unilateralism and norm evasion. The paper missed that “lots of AI delegates” doesn’t cancel combinatorial explosion when every delegate can create binding constraints; it can amplify it.
