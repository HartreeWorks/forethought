> The paper assumes most moral views can be cheaply satisfied with a small resource slice, but many plausible post-AGI views demand global conditions that make peaceful coexistence through trade fundamentally impossible.

“Resource-Compatibility Is Doing Hidden Work” (attacks Pivot 4: that many views are “highly resource-compatible” or “easily-satiable,” so small transfers can buy near-best outcomes for many moral perspectives). The essay’s optimism under moral uncertainty leans on the idea that, in cosmic terms, it may be cheap to satisfy lots of views by giving them a small slice—suggesting a large Pareto surface and hence high expected flourishing. But many of the paper’s own “fork in the future” examples are precisely cases where views are *not* cheaply satiable (they demand control over the same domains, prohibit the other’s projects, or care about global properties like “no exploitation anywhere”). If the marginally common post-AGI moral views are global, non-local, and identity/ontology-sensitive (e.g., “only biological humans count,” “no digital minds,” “no value in wireheading,” “no coercion”), then “small slices” don’t buy peace or near-best outcomes; they buy isolated enclaves whose existence is still unacceptable to others. If resource-compatibility is rarer than the argument assumes, then trade cannot generally rescue us from the narrow-target problem, and the paper’s optimism should be revised downward or made conditional on a demonstrated compatibility distribution. The paper would need to operationalize compatibility (what constraints count, what global properties matter) and argue empirically/theoretically that compatible views dominate among future power-holders.
