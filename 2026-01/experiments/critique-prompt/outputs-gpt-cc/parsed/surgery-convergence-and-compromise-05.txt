**Load-bearing claim:**
resource-compatibility and partitioning make near-best outcomes simultaneously achievable for divergent views

**Attack type:**
Quantitative cliff

Partitioning works only before certain scale thresholds: once expansion produces many semi-autonomous, fast-replicating actors, the value of *strategic depth* (buffer zones, denial capability, monitoring shells) grows superlinearly, so groups rationally demand more than “their fair share” of resources just to feel secure. Past some expansion/replication rate, the bargaining set collapses because every additional galaxy has security externalities, so “give utilitarians other galaxies” stops being a clean Pareto improvement and becomes a contested arms-race variable. If this critique holds, the paper’s headline compromise examples are not representative; optimism should be conditioned on staying below a **security externality threshold** or on strong global security institutions (which the paper also treats as questionable under value plurality).
