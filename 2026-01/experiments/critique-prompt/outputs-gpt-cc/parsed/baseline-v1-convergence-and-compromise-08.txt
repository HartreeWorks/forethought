The treatment of “moral trade” often presumes frictionless bargaining, enforceable contracts, and clean separability of resources (e.g., “this galaxy for your utopia, that galaxy for mine”), but real-world bargaining is shaped by bargaining power, commitment races, credible threats, and path dependence. Without a more formal game-theoretic account, the optimism about compromise looks sensitive to idealized assumptions that the paper itself flags as “blockers” rather than integrating them into the main forecast.
