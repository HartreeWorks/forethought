[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: “scenario (3) is higher-impact to act on than scenario (1), so don’t power-seek” (section 5). Failure mechanism: you assume marginal influence scales smoothly with “1 billionth of global power” arithmetic, but in real strategic environments influence is thresholded—control of a single chokepoint (compute, enforcement layer, contract court, identity registry) dominates all your fractional calculations. Attack vector: Agent A ignores your advice, power-seeks precisely for the chokepoint, then sets the bargaining protocol, the contract semantics, and the definition of “threat,” converting everyone else’s altruism into a resource they can tax. Consequence: your attempt to defuse power-seeking becomes an own-goal: it selects for unilateralists while persuading potential countervailing actors to stand down. Failure state outcome: a small number of defectors seize protocol-level power, and your envisioned pluralistic moral trade world becomes a single-stack sovereignty—one that can cheaply simulate “compromise” while locking in its own values forever.
