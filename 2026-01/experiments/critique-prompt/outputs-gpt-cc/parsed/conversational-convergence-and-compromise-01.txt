**"The ‘narrow target’ premise is asserted more than demonstrated"**  
The paper’s downstream pessimism/optimism hinges on “no easy eutopia”: that most attainable futures lose most value unless one hits a small target. But “value” is left sufficiently underspecified (across population ethics, welfare theory, aggregation, lexicalities, etc.) that it’s unclear the target is actually narrow rather than “thick” across many plausible axiologies. Many moral theories are coarse-grained: they rank huge regions of outcome-space as similarly good once basic constraints (rights, suffering limits, autonomy, meaningful agency) are met. If so, convergence or trade would not need to be extremely precise to capture “most achievable value.” Without a more formal argument for target narrowness under a wide moral-uncertainty portfolio, the paper may be building on an unstable foundation.
