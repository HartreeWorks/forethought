> The paper's core argument hinges on "accurate" moral views, but that word quietly means different things under realism versus antirealism, making its key predictions hard to pin down.

"Ambiguity About ‘Accurate’ and ‘Correct’ Moral Views" — WAM-convergence is defined as convergence on an “accurate understanding” of what makes the future good, plus motivation, but the paper does not settle what accuracy amounts to under the metaethical uncertainty it later foregrounds. In realist contexts, “accurate” means tracking mind-independent moral facts; in antirealist contexts, it becomes unclear whether “accuracy” means coherence, idealization, endorsement, or something else. The argument in 2.4 sometimes treats “correct view” as a single determinate target, yet in 2.4.2 it admits subjectivist targets are agent-relative, undermining the unified notion of “accuracy.” Because “accurate” shifts meaning across the paper, claims like “if WAM-convergence, we will reach a mostly-great future” become difficult to evaluate: convergence to what, and by whose standard? This conceptual slippage weakens the central inference that convergence failures predict low flourishing.
