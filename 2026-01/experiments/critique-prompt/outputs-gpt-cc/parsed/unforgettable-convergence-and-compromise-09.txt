> The case for favouring broad convergence over power-seeking assumes a sweet spot where individual influence scales meaningfully—but the paper's own discussion of lock-in and power concentration suggests that's unlikely.

**“Influence Elasticity Mismatch”**: The paper argues that **we should act as if scenario (3) (broad convergence) is more decision-relevant than scenario (1)**, because **your marginal efforts can more plausibly shift Survival/Flourishing by meaningful fractions in (3) than your power-seeking can in (1)**. But the essay’s own blockers (power concentration, early lock-in, poor decision procedures) imply that marginal influence is highly **nonlinear**: in worlds where convergence and trade would matter, outcomes may hinge on a small set of institutional choke points, making most individual actions near-zero; in worlds where institutions are diffuse enough for marginal influence, trade/convergence likely already pushes you toward decent outcomes, shrinking the counterfactual impact. So the recommendation rests on an unstated assumption that we are in a “sweet spot” where (3) holds *and* influence is elastically scalable by typical actors—an assumption the paper’s political economy discussion undercuts. This is paper-specific because it targets the step where the essay converts its convergence/trade analysis into a practical stance against power-seeking. If this holds, the paper would need a model tying concrete present-day interventions to **control over future bargaining institutions**, not just to abstract probabilities of Surviving/Flourishing.
