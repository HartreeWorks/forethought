"The ‘Narrow Target’ Premise Is Under-Argued" — The entire paper leans heavily on the inherited claim from “No Easy Eutopia” that “mostly-great futures are a very narrow target,” and then treats this as a stable background assumption across sections 2–5. But in this essay the author rarely re-defends that premise, even though many later inferences (e.g., that small residual disagreements “ensure” massive value loss) are only as strong as the narrow-target claim. The paper oscillates between “narrow in the space of policies/designs” and “narrow in the space of moral views,” yet those are different notions of narrowness with different implications for convergence and trade. If “mostly-great” is instead wide in practice because many institutional/technological trajectories robustly realize large fractions of value, then the pessimism about partial disagreement becomes overstated. Without a clearer metric of “distance from best” and a justification that value cliffs are common, the argument risks being driven by an undefended framing choice.
