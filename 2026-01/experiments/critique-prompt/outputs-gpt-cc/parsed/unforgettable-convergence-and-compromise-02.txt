> Cheap credible commitment doesn't just enable cooperation—it turbocharges blackmail, making threat-free bargaining the fragile exception rather than the default the paper assumes.

**“Threats Are the Equilibrium, Not the Exception”**: The paper argues that **trade/compromise under partial AM‑convergence** implies **high expected flourishing unless executed threats take a meaningful fraction of resources**, because **most bargaining is positive-sum and threats are a value-eating add-on**. In a world with superintelligent agents and “iron-clad contracts,” credible commitment is cheap, so extortionary threat-making becomes a **strategically stable bargaining technology**, not a rare pathology: even agents with mild values can gain bargaining power by committing to destructive actions contingent on noncompliance. That turns threats into an arms race where the *absence* of threats is the fragile special case, and “small fraction of resources on threats” is not a free parameter but an unstable outcome. This flips the paper’s optimism: the very mechanisms invoked to enable frictionless moral trade also turbocharge credible blackmail. If this holds, the paper would need to show a **robust equilibrium-selection or mechanism-design result** that makes threatless bargaining stable despite commitment power—something much stronger than “institutions might prevent threats.”
