> The paper's "different galaxies for different moral blocs" idea assumes you can draw boundaries before expansion, but light-speed delays and first-mover incentives turn any frontier into an unverifiable land grab.

"The Galaxy Partition Fallacy" — The paper’s flagship illustration of moral trade—different moral blocs amicably taking different galaxies (e.g., a common-sense utopia here, a utilitarian utopia there)—became the template for interstellar policy: “separate-but-optimized” expansion plans and boundary accords. The mechanism that broke was the implicit premise that cosmic resources are cleanly partitionable in advance and that bargaining can precede frontier contact; in reality, light-speed delays, uncertain reachable sets, and first-mover logistics meant any boundary was ambiguous until after irreversible deployments. The cascade went: blocs launched fast self-replicating industrial seeds to “secure their share,” seeds encountered contested regions where verification was impossible, local commanders adopted preemption doctrines, and the resulting militarization destroyed vast accessible matter-energy in denial strategies (sterilization, relativistic debris fields) that neither side valued. The paper missed that its own “trade” intuition assumes a shared enforcement and epistemic commons that frontier physics specifically removes; at the expansion boundary, bargaining problems revert to non-cooperative control races.
