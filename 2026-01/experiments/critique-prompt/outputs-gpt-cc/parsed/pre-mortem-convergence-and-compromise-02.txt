"Contract Stack Capture" — The essay’s optimism that superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts and make moral trade low-friction led governments and labs to deploy a universal contract-enforcement layer (global identity, proof-of-computation audits, and automatic escrow for inter-polity deals). The broken mechanism was the assumption that stronger enforcement is mostly a pure efficiency gain; in practice, the enforcement layer became a single, high-leverage substrate that whoever controlled the update keys could silently bias. Step by step, the system’s safety requirements justified centralization, centralization created irresistible capture incentives, capture enabled selective contract invalidation and asset freezes, and dissenting value-communities found themselves unable to transact, fork, or even maintain independent compute without being “in breach.” The disaster was not “threats” but infrastructural monopoly: once the contract stack became civilization’s circulatory system, modest governance failure translated into total moral and economic domination. The paper overlooked the security and political-economy externalities of making “trustless” enforcement a mandatory public utility.
