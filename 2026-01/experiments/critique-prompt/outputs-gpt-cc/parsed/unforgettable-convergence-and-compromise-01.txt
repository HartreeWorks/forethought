> If many plausible moral views care about what happens *everywhere*—not just in your own slice—then dividing up galaxies doesn't actually let each group get most of what it wants.

**“Partition Illusion”**: The paper argues that **partial AM‑convergence + moral trade** implies **a mostly‑great future**, because **groups can carve up resources (e.g., “Milky Way vs other galaxies”) and each pursue near‑best outcomes on their own turf**. This inference breaks if a large fraction of plausible “correct” (or strongly held) moral views have **essentially global, non-separable value**—e.g., valuing uniqueness, non-duplication, universal moral status rules, historical continuity, or “no suffering anywhere” constraints that treat *others’* regions as morally contaminating. Under those views, letting another coalition run a disjoint galaxy “their way” is not a small concession but a decisive loss, so the basic gains-from-trade picture collapses even with perfect contracting. This is not a generic “externalities exist” worry; it targets the paper’s signature move of treating cosmic resources as tradable parcels that preserve most value for each side. If this objection holds, the paper would need to replace spatial/resource partitioning with an account of **shared constitutional governance** that can satisfy globally-scoped constraints—i.e., trade becomes secondary to designing a universally acceptable meta-order.
