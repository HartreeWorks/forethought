The paper claims that superintelligence could enable “iron-clad contracts” and thereby unlock moral trade (3.1), but it never specifies what the contract actually ranges over when the objects being traded are future causal control and potentially self-modifying agents. The failure mode is that the enforceability of a contract depends on state observability, identity persistence, and non-circumventability—exactly the things that break when parties can fork, merge, rewrite preferences, or spin off unaccountable delegates. In mechanism terms, you can’t just assert low transaction costs; you have to define the message space, enforcement primitives, and what prevents off-contract side channels (e.g., creating copies that weren’t signatories, or moving resources into hidden substrates). The concrete consequence is that the “contract solves trust” assumption collapses precisely in the highest-stakes bargains (allocation of galaxies, creation of digital minds, threat-prevention regimes), leaving you with informal power contests rather than trade. If this objection holds, section 3’s main enabling technology is underspecified to the point of being fictional, so the compromise story cannot carry the weight the essay puts on it.
