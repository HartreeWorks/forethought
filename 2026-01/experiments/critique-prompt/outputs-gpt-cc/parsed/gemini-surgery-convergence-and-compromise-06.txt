The “long views win” mechanism in 2.3.3 is treated as a possible selector for altruistic/non-discounting values, but the paper then largely reasons as if the relevant bargaining happens in a regime where diverse values coexist with negotiable shares. The hidden incompatibility is that the same dynamics that make “long views win” plausible (self-modification, compounding, strategic patience) also make *first-mover capture and path-dependent lock-in* plausible, which can preempt the slow selection effects entirely. Counter-model: patient agents reinvest into capability, reach decisive strategic advantage early, and lock in a stable resource claim before demographic/wealth selection has time to shift population-level values; then “long views win” predicts dominance of whichever view got early compounding, not dominance of altruism or of anything reflective. This fits your own “major decisions might be made soon and persist” caveat, but if that caveat is taken seriously it undercuts the paper’s broader optimism about eventual trade/compromise emerging from a pluralistic landscape. The needed revision is to explicitly model the race between (i) compounding-driven power capture and (ii) value-selection-over-time, and show which regime is expected under your assumed post‑AGI timelines.
