**"The ‘Long Views Win’ Reversal"**: Your asymmetric-growth section floats a selection story in which patient, non-discounting values accumulate resources over time, but your later trade analysis identifies precisely those non-discounting, linear-in-resources views as the regime where compromise becomes least effective and threats become most dangerous. The inference being attacked is: “Selection effects toward patience are a reason for optimism about altruistic dominance or convergence.” Mechanism: if patience selects for linear, uncompromising utilities (including non-altruistic collector/positional goals you mention), then over time the negotiating population becomes *more* dominated by the very value types that (i) have low resource-compatibility, and (ii) can rationally justify extreme coercion because marginal resources never stop mattering. Under those plausible conditions, the argument implies the opposite of your intended conclusion: longer time horizons make the compromise path less, not more, likely to yield mostly-great outcomes. If this objection holds, you must either show why patience specifically selects for *cooperative* value structures (not merely non-discounting ones), or abandon asymmetric growth as an optimism lever and treat it as a driver toward your hardest trade/threat cases.
