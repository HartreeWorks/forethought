**Load-bearing claim:**
In **§3.1–§3.2** you propose cosmic “partition” trade (Milky Way commonsense utopia; other galaxies utilitarian utopia) and suggest “enormous gains from trade” with low transaction costs and enforceable contracts

**Attack type:**
Strategic response (boundary manipulation / bargaining power)

Once values are tradable at cosmic scale, actors have incentives to *reshape their expressed utility functions* to improve bargaining position (commit to lexicographic preferences, claim extreme disutility for others’ projects, or cultivate “non-negotiable sacred values”) because doing so extracts concessions—especially if contracts are enforceable. This turns “moral trade” into a selection process for agents who can credibly commit to intransigence, reducing the feasibility of near-Pareto partitions and pushing outcomes toward threat-like equilibria even without explicit “threats” as you define them. If this holds, your optimism about compromise depends on an unstated assumption: bargainers reveal honest, smooth, comparable preferences and can’t cheaply self-modify to become harder negotiators. You’d need to model mechanism design for preference revelation (or institutional constraints on self-modification/commitment) rather than assuming frictionless cooperative bargaining.
