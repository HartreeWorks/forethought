> The internalism/externalism dilemma is a false fork—it ignores hybrid positions and second-order moral commitments that undercut the paper's pessimistic squeeze play.

"Misuse of Internalism/Externalism and Motivation to Believe" — The discussion of internalism suggests that if moral judgment is intrinsically motivating, then people may choose not to learn moral facts that would motivate them against self-interest. But internalism is typically a thesis about the link between sincerely judging “I ought to φ” and being motivated to φ, not about a general aversion to forming moral beliefs. The inference from internalism to strategic ignorance also overlooks that agents can be motivated by second-order commitments (e.g., wanting to be moral, wanting to be the kind of person who responds to reasons), which internalism arguably supports rather than undermines. Conversely, under externalism the paper claims convergence on correct beliefs may not translate to action; yet institutions can harness belief without intrinsic motivation via incentives, reputation, and delegation to aligned systems. As written, the internalism/externalism fork functions more like a rhetorical squeeze than a careful argument, because it ignores well-known intermediate positions (hybrid internalism, reasons externalism, Humean theories with strong moral desires) that complicate the pessimistic conclusion.
