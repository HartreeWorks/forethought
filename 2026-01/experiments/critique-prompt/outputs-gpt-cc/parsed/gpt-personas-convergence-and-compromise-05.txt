[The Mechanistic Alignment Skeptic — Adversarial adaptation / Goodhart] Target claim: “superintelligent reflection and advice” will resolve empirical disagreements and reduce “transparent reasoning errors,” enabling better convergence and bargaining (2.3.1). Failure mechanism: you treat “better reasoning” as monotone with “better outcomes,” but reflection plus optimization power creates Goodhart pressure on whatever proxy the advisers use for “ethical correctness,” especially when agents can self-modify and select advisers with congenial personalities/training (2.2.1, 2.3.1). Even if the adviser is genuinely superintelligent, distribution shift bites: the reflective process itself becomes an object-level battleground, and small differences in starting points/adviser selection get amplified into lock-in because the system is now optimizing *over* the space of value-change procedures (you list the “free parameters” of idealization in 2.4.2). Consequence: the post-AGI world you invoke to increase reflection doesn’t push toward WAM/AM-convergence; it creates stable attractors of self-endorsing reflective loops (“epistemic black holes” in 2.5) that are *more* resistant to correction precisely because they are superintelligently defended.
