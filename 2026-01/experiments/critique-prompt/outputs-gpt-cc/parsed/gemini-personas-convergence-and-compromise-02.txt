[The Technical Hardliner] Target claim: “superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts” and thus low transaction costs for moral trade (end of 3.1). Failure mechanism: you never define the contract language, the oracle model, the adjudication procedure, or the physical enforcement assumptions in a post-AGI world—so “iron-clad” is pure hand-waving. Attack vector: Agent A proposes a contract referencing “promote digital welfare considerably” (3.2) or “executed threats amount to a small fraction” (3.4), then exploits specification gaps (Goodharted proxies, ambiguous ontology of “digital beings,” identity over uploads) to claim compliance while implementing the opposite. Consequence: the system becomes litigation-by-superintelligence where whoever controls the spec wins, and “contract certainty” amplifies value drift because errors are now irreversible. Failure state outcome: you lock in the wrong objective functions at cosmic scale with cryptographic finality, turning what should have been reversible moral exploration into permanent misallocation.
