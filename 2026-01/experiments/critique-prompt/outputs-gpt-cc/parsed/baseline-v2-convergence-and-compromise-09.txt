> The paper's conclusions hinge on threat dynamics, yet by its own admission it hasn't seriously analysed them—leaving the central load-bearing variable essentially unmodelled.

"The Threats Discussion Is Both Central and Underdeveloped" — Section 3.3 admits the authors have “not particularly dug into” threats, yet later conclusions give threats a decisive role in whether trade yields a mostly-great future (and even whether futures are worse than extinction). This is a methodological weakness: a key variable is treated as largely unanalyzed, while being used to drive major conditional verdicts in 3.4 and the conclusion. The paper also slides from “threats are possible” to “even small risks can easily eat into expected value” without modeling threat prevalence, credibility, commitment mechanisms, or equilibrium selection effects in multi-agent settings. In many bargaining theories, credible threats are limited by commitment costs, reputation effects, coalition formation, and mutually assured retaliation—none of which are seriously incorporated. Because the threats claim is doing heavy argumentative work, its current speculative treatment undermines the reliability of the overall optimism/pessimism balance.
