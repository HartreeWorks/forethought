> The same institutions that make moral trade credible also make coercion credible, so without a specific mechanism for landing in the cooperative equilibrium rather than the extortion one, the net value of trade is underdetermined.

**“Trade Needs a Shared Threat Model”** — The paper’s pro-trade story assumes that with low transaction costs and strong contracts, moral trade will realize large gains (§3.1), but the threat discussion (§3.3) concedes the authors “have not particularly dug into” extortion dynamics while also suggesting even small executed-threat risk can wipe out value on many views. The failure mechanism is that these are not separable: the very institutions that enable credible commitment and enforcement (and thus trade) also enable credible coercion, blackmail, and commitment races, and the equilibrium selection between “trade world” and “threat world” depends on detailed mechanism design. Without a model of how a society gets (and stays) in the cooperative equilibrium rather than the extortion equilibrium, the net sign of “trade increases expected Flourishing” is underdetermined. If this objection holds, the paper would need to make its optimism conditional on specific anti-extortion governance designs and argue that those designs are stable under the same power and bargaining assumptions the essay uses elsewhere.
