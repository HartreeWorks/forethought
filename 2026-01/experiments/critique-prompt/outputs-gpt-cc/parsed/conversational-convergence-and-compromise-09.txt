**"The paper relies on contentious assumptions about value ‘linearity’ and diminishing returns"**  
A lot of the trade/convergence discussion is organized around whether correct preferences are linear in resources, bounded, negative-leaning, separably aggregated, etc. But we have little reason to expect the relevant utility structure to be stable under self-modification, digital life, or population scaling; the shape could itself be an object of strategic manipulation. Agents may adopt utility functions that are bargaining-advantageous (e.g., more “linear” or more “lexical”) because it improves their threat points, not because it reflects deep values. Moreover, even today, revealed “diminishing returns” are confounded by positional competition, identity goods, and status—features likely to persist or intensify at cosmic scale. If the utility-shape assumptions don’t hold, many of the paper’s comparative statics about when trade yields near-best outcomes stop tracking reality.
