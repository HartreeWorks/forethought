**"Cardinal-Value Comparability as the Unstated Engine"**: Your trade story quietly assumes that different moral views can be represented in a way that supports meaningful bargaining—i.e., that there is a shared notion of “resources,” marginal rates of substitution, and (often) something like cardinal comparability for negotiating splits and hybrid goods. The inference being attacked is: “Moral trade can be systematically positive-sum at cosmic scale.” Step-by-step: many of your own example disagreements are over lexicographic or sacred values (worship, identity, deontic constraints, rights, separate aggregation of bads/goods) where no amount of compensation is acceptable; in those cases there is no stable ‘price’ at which the view trades away the contested action, and bargaining reduces to coercion, not exchange. If this objection holds, you must explicitly restrict the scope of the trade optimism to a class of utility representations where compensation and aggregation are well-defined, and separately analyze (not handwave) the lexicographic/sacred-value cases—which your own taxonomy suggests may be common and structurally hostile to compromise.
