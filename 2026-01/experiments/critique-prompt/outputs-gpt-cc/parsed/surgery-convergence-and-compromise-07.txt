**Load-bearing claim:**
if threats are feasible, they meaningfully undermine trade because extortion can systematically transfer resources away from the correct view, even absent execution

**Attack type:**
Equilibrium shift

In bargaining environments with sophisticated agents, the ability to threaten changes what counts as a “resource”: agents will invest in threat-capability as a primary asset class, and then—crucially—*trade itself* selects for those who can credibly menace, because they extract better terms and compound power. That dynamic can turn the “partial AM-convergence + trade” story into a selection mechanism *against* AM agents (who the paper notes may be less willing to threaten), making their initial minority share shrink over time even if they start with leverage. If this critique holds, compromise is not merely “fragile to threats”; it is potentially **anti-correlated with moral quality** via selection effects, and the paper’s optimism about trade needs to incorporate this endogenous drift toward coercive bargaining equilibria.
