The analysis underestimates counterexamples where compromise is impossible or unstable even among “reasonable” moral views—e.g., sacred values, deontological side-constraints, agent-relative permissions, or lexical priorities that block tradeoffs. If many agents treat some constraints as non-negotiable, then “resource-compatibility” and “hybrid goods” may not rescue value, and the paper’s bargaining-based optimism narrows to a limited subset of moral psychologies.
