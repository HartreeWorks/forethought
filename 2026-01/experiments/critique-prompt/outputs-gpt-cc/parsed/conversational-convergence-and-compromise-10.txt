**"The conclusion about prioritizing ‘flourishing’ over ‘surviving’ may be a decision-theoretic misstep"**  
The essay ends by arguing that the ceiling on flourishing dominates survival risk in scale, and suggests shifting emphasis accordingly. But when there is deep uncertainty over value theory, bargaining equilibria, and lock-in dynamics, preserving optionality (i.e., survival plus flexibility) can be instrumentally dominant. Extinction is uniquely irreversible; many “flourishing gaps” might be addressable later if civilization survives with decent epistemics and governance. Also, interventions that improve flourishing prospects (via pluralism/trade) could increase extinction or lock-in risks by intensifying multipolar competition—so the objectives are not cleanly separable. Without a more explicit model of interdependence between survival and flourishing interventions under uncertainty, the portfolio recommendation is not well supported by the preceding analysis.
