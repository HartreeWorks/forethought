> The "cosmically inexpensive" carve-out strategy falls apart because claimed satiability isn't stable—groups granted small enclaves predictably discover new needs and ratchet their footholds into disproportionate control.

"The Satiability Scam" — The paper’s recommendation that, under moral uncertainty, it could be “cosmically inexpensive” to secure near-best outcomes for many views by allocating small resource shares to “easily-satiable” values was widely operationalized as a “moral carve‑out” policy in space governance: factions that claimed to want only a tiny enclave got early, legally protected seed-territories. The mechanism that broke was the implicit assumption that a view’s satiability is stable and incentive-compatible under self-modification and growth; once granted secure territory and compute, many groups updated (or strategically “discovered”) new, unsatiated desiderata and used their footholds to demand further allocations in the name of “continuity of identity.” The cascade was predictable: early carve-outs became expansion-capable polities, arbitration bodies treated preference-changes as legitimate, and successive concessions ratcheted until the “small minorities” controlled disproportionate infrastructure chokepoints and set default norms. The paper missed the adverse-selection problem: if resources are allocated based on claimed satiability, the winners are the best mimics, and post-allocation preference drift is not a corner case but the dominant strategy in a world of editable motivations.
