[The Game-Theoretic Defector — Incentive incompatibility / equilibrium shift] Target claim: in 3.1–3.2 you treat “moral trade” as a route to a near-best future even with only partial AM-convergence (as low as “not less than one in a million”). Failure mechanism: the moment “moral concern” is tradeable across groups, you create an incentive gradient for agents to *masquerade* as high-moral-intensity minorities to extract concessions, because the mechanism you rely on is precisely “I care far more than you, so pay me.” In equilibrium, the actors most willing to lie/commit/blackmail (not the actors with the “correct” view) become the price-setters for what gets allocated, and sincere AM-convergers get selected against because they’re predictable and extortable (you basically concede this in 3.3). Consequence: the bargaining institution you propose doesn’t just fail to guarantee “mostly-great”; it actively reallocates resources toward the most strategically credible value-claims, which is orthogonal to “correctness” and predictably drifts toward coercive moral rent-seeking.
