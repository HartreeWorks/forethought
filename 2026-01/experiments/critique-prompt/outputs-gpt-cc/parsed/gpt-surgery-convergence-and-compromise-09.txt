**Load-bearing claim:**
In **§3.3 (“problem of threats”)** you treat threats as a mostly negative overlay on otherwise-positive trade, and imply preventing them is a key lever: “*even small risks of executed threats can easily eat into the expected value*.”

**Attack type:**
Reversal (threat-suppression increases covert coercion / worse equilibria)

In a world with “iron-clad contracts” and powerful enforcement, an anti-threat legal regime can create incentives for *stealthy, deniable, hard-to-classify harms* (e.g., creating beings whose suffering is epistemically occluded, or designing harms that look like normal production externalities) because overt threats are punishable but covert leverage isn’t. That can make expected disvalue *higher* than in an open-threat world where threats are legible and deterrable via countercommitments, insurance pools, or preemptive bargaining. If this holds, “prevent threats” is not monotone-good; the policy lever can shift harm into channels that are cheaper to execute and harder to police. You’d need to specify the enforcement/observability assumptions under which anti-threat institutions reduce rather than displace coercion, and adjust §3.4’s “mostly-great if threats prevented” conclusion accordingly.
