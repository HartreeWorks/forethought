[The Capability Externalist — Hidden coupling / systems interaction] Target claim: post-AGI “abundance” plus diminishing marginal utility will likely increase altruistic spending shares (2.3.2), nudging the world toward better outcomes. Failure mechanism: abundance is not an exogenous gift; it is produced by capabilities that are themselves competitive, and your own examples of linear-in-resources preferences (galaxy-collecting, positional cosmic rivalries) imply that increased capability increases *the marginal returns to dominance*, not charity. The same automation that makes everyone “millions or billions of times richer” also makes coercion, surveillance, replication, and interstellar expansion cheap—so the strategic environment shifts toward winner-take-most contests where “altruistic spending” is dominated by spending on control. Consequence: your abundance story can invert: wealth doesn’t relax tradeoffs into generosity; it bankrolls the capability race that determines who sets the value-constitution, making the future less about diminishing returns and more about decisive strategic advantage.
