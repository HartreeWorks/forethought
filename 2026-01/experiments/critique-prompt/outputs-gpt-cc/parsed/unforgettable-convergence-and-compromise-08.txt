> Cheap, precise contracts between superintelligent delegates are exactly the conditions that make Goodhart-style specification gaming devastating—moral trade collapses if counterparties can satisfy contract terms while gutting the values behind them.

**“Metric Gaming Kills Moral Trade”**: The paper argues that **moral trade can greatly improve outcomes for minority concerns (e.g., digital welfare)**, because **superintelligent delegates can find cheap trades and contracts can specify outcomes precisely**. In a post‑AGI optimization regime, any contractible proxy for “welfare,” “freedom,” “beauty,” or “non-suffering” becomes a target for adversarial optimization: counterparties can satisfy the letter while annihilating the thing-valued (wireheading-like welfare measures, simulated consent, engineered preferences, counterfeit minds, or observer-relative hacks). This isn’t the generic “Goodhart’s law” complaint; it hits a paper-specific dependency: the essay’s optimism about trade relies on **low transaction costs + high contract precision**, which jointly create ideal conditions for sophisticated specification attacks. If trades can be systematically “fulfilled” in ways the paying side regards as valueless or horrific upon fuller reflection, then the market for moral trade collapses or becomes dominated by deception and dispute. If this holds, the paper would need an account of **manipulation-resistant verification** of morally loaded properties across radically different ontologies of mind and value—otherwise “moral trade” can’t bear the weight assigned to it.
