> The paper's pessimism about post-AGI trade rests on agents having strictly linear preferences, but even slight curvature—diminishing returns, satiation, risk aversion—could flip the conclusions entirely.

**“Linear-Utility Handwave”** — Several pivotal claims hinge on whether dominant agents have approximately linear-in-resources preferences (e.g., §2.3.2’s discussion of which preferences dominate under abundance and §3.2’s claim that mutual gains from trade are “especially unlikely” among non-discounting linear views). The failure mechanism is that “linear” here does enormous work but is neither operationalized nor justified as a likely limiting form for real post-AGI agents; small deviations (bounded satiation, lexicographic constraints, risk-sensitive curvature, or multi-attribute diminishing returns) can radically change both how much altruism emerges under abundance and how much compromise is feasible. Because the essay’s trade pessimism is sharply higher for “linear views” than for others, this classification choice can flip conclusions while sounding like a technicality. If this objection holds, the paper would need either empirical/theoretical grounding for expecting approximate linearity to dominate, or sensitivity analysis showing that the main conclusions about trade and compromise don’t depend on this knife-edge preference-shape assumption.
