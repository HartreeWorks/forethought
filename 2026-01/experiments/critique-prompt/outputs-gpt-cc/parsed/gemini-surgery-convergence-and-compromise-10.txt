The “concentration of power is a blocker” claim in 3.5 depends on an implicit independence assumption: the moral correctness (or AM-convergent fraction) among the powerful is roughly the same as among the general population, so fewer power-holders means lower probability the “correct view” is represented. A counter-model is one where the process that concentrates power is *positively correlated* with the paper’s own prerequisites for AM-convergence: long time horizons, willingness to use reflective AI advisors, comfort with abstraction, and norm internalization—traits that could plausibly be overrepresented among those who end up controlling key institutions/compute. Then power concentration can *increase* the representation of reflective altruists (even if it decreases diversity), raising rather than lowering the chance that partial AM-convergence exists at the bargaining table. If this critique holds, the paper must replace the monotonic “more concentration ⇒ worse” inference with a model that conditions on selection effects into power and their correlation (positive or negative) with the kinds of moral reflection/motivation you care about.
