The claim that internalism would lead people to “choose not to learn or believe the correct moral view” is psychologically and conceptually shaky. Even if moral judgment is motivating, it does not follow that agents can or will systematically avoid moral belief formation, nor that such avoidance would be stable in institutions that reward truth-tracking and disclosure.
