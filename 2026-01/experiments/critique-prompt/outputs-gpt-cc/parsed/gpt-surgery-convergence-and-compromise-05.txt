In **§2.3.3 (“Long views win”)** you argue patient/altruistic agents may outgrow others via saving/fertility, but then note it may be too slow if “major decisions are made soon.” **Attack type: Quantitative cliff.** Your mechanism has a sharp threshold: if lock-in occurs before the compounding advantage accumulates, the effect is ~0; if after, it can dominate. Yet you treat it qualitatively and then pivot to trade in §3 without quantifying the timing condition that decides whether “long views win” matters at all. A plausible world has rapid, early constitutional lock-in of cosmic property rights (or AI-controlled enforcement) within decades of AGI, making demographic/wealth-selection irrelevant; another world has centuries of competitive expansion where it dominates. If this holds, your optimism/pessimism updates can swing by orders of magnitude based on an unmodeled timeline parameter. You’d need to introduce explicit timing scenarios (lock-in half-life, institutional mutability) and show how your conclusions change across them.
