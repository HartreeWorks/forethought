The paper’s discussion of preventing value-destroying threats implicitly assumes the possibility of a broadly stable, mutually agreeable “legal system” that deters threats without being gamed (3.3–3.4), but it ignores that any such system becomes the prime target for capture. The failure mechanism is classic principal–agent failure at cosmic scale: the enforcement apparatus (courts, auditors, monitoring AIs) accrues discretionary power and informational advantage, and then optimizes for its own continuation, allies, and ideological constituency rather than “threat minimization.” Once captured, anti-threat rules become selectively enforced tools for suppressing disfavored moral minorities (“your project counts as a threat”) while permitting extortionate behavior by insiders (“security exceptions”). The concrete consequence is that the very institution meant to prevent executed threats becomes the highest-leverage threat generator, because it can credibly punish noncompliance and reclassify rivals as violators. If this holds, the paper’s proposed fix for threats is not a stabilizer; it is a path to durable coercive lock-in under the banner of “threat prevention.”
