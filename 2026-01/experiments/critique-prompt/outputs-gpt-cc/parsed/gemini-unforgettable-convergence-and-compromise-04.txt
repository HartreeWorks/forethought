“The paper’s central optimism is numerology because your value model makes expectation undefined.” You casually update from “<1%” to “5–10% Flourishing,” but your own taxonomy repeatedly entertains unbounded value above, unbounded disvalue below, separate aggregation, and heavy weight on bads—exactly the conditions under which expected value is typically dominated, undefined, or hypersensitive to tiny probability mass in tails. In that regime, talking about “5–10% of what it might be” is not a rough estimate; it’s a category error, because “what it might be” is not a finite yardstick and the ratio is not stable under small modeling changes. This isn’t fixable by adding caveats: the quantitative posture is doing rhetorical work (tempering despair, motivating a portfolio) while the underlying axiological space you describe makes that posture illegitimate. If you defend by bounding utilities, you erase much of the paper’s own argumentation about threats and “no easy eutopia,” which depends on extreme sensitivity to bads and tail outcomes.
