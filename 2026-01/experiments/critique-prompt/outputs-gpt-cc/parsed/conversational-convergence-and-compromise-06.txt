**"The threat/extortion problem likely dominates, undermining the trade path"**  
The paper notes threats could eat most value, but arguably understates how structurally pervasive they are once agents can cheaply create bad states as bargaining chips. In high-powered settings, credible commitment technologies can make extortion stable: “pay me or I instantiate X trillion tortured minds” is hard to deter if deterrence itself requires committing to costly retaliation. This becomes even worse under moral pluralism because some parties may *value* making other parties worse off (spite, status, ideological victory), collapsing gains-from-trade assumptions. If threats are cheap relative to defenses, then the equilibrium may be closer to hostage-taking than to Pareto-improving bargaining. In that case, “partial AM + trade” is not a reliable rescue from no-easy-eutopia; it’s a recipe for value destruction.
