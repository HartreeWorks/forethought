> Enforcement of moral trade breaks down where it matters most—you can't verify or punish hidden compute or interstellar defections, so rational agents default to preemptive control over compromise.

“Iron-Clad Contracts Don’t Survive Light-Cone Constraints” (attacks Pivot 2: that superintelligence enables “iron-clad contracts” and low transaction costs, making moral trade reliably implementable). The argument leans on future tech making enforcement cheap and trust easy, but many relevant enforcement problems are not computational—they are physical and relativistic: you can’t verify or punish defections across interstellar distances on timescales that keep incentives aligned, and you can’t maintain a shared adjudicator without granting it decisive power (reintroducing concentration). Moreover, “contracting” over moral performance (e.g., “don’t run suffering simulations,” “don’t deploy threats”) is notoriously non-verifiable even locally, because the relevant actions can be hidden in compute or embedded in opaque systems. If enforcement is weak where stakes are largest, then rational agents will discount promised concessions, reducing realized gains from trade and pushing outcomes toward preemptive control rather than compromise—undercutting the paper’s central optimism lever. If this objection holds, the paper would need a concrete mechanism for verifiable compliance (e.g., auditable compute substrates, credible mutual monitoring, or constrained architectures) that doesn’t itself require a hegemon.
