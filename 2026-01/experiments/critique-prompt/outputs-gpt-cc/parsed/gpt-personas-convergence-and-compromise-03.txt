[The Security Engineer — Adversarial adaptation / Goodhart] Target claim: “superintelligence could enable iron-clad contracts” and drastically lower transaction costs, making trade/compromise robust (3.1). Failure mechanism: you model contract enforcement like a solved cryptography problem, but your threat model includes adaptive agents who optimize around whatever enforcement substrate exists—especially when the stakes include cosmic resources and the payoffs are effectively unbounded for some views (3.4). “Iron-clad” enforcement becomes a single point of failure: it concentrates power in the adjudication layer (definitions, oracles, identity, continuity of agents, interpretation under self-modification), which adversaries will Goodhart by shaping the semantics rather than “breaking” the crypto. Consequence: instead of frictionless positive-sum trade, you get an arms race over the contract layer itself; the first group to capture the ontology/verification pipeline can expropriate everyone while still being “compliant,” collapsing your optimistic reliance on low transaction costs.
