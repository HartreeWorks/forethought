**“De Dicto Collapse Under Antirealism”**: The paper argues that **WAM‑convergence is unlikely under antirealism** and thus **trade/partial convergence is the practical route**, because **without objective moral truth, idealization procedures diverge on many ‘free parameters’**. But the paper also relies on “promote the good de dicto” as a coherent motivational attractor that some agents might converge to even amid disagreement; under antirealism, however, “the good de dicto” is **not a stable target** because choosing *which* idealization procedure to treat as authoritative is itself just another first-order preference. That means “de dicto motivation” quietly reduces to “de re motivation toward my favored idealizer,” making the AM/WAM taxonomy less explanatory and making “accurate convergence” partly **definition-dependent**. This breaks a load-bearing inference: that we can talk about “some meaningful fraction converges on the correct view and is motivated by it” in a way that supports predictions about bargaining behavior. If this holds, the paper would need to formalize a **meta-preference convergence mechanism** (why agents converge on the *same* authority/idealizer) or else abandon de dicto motivation as a predictive category for post‑AGI bargaining.
