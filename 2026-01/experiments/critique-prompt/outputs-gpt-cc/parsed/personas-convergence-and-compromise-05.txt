The paper treats post-AGI abundance and superintelligent deliberation as if they arrive under “reasonably good conditions” and then society gets to bargain (2.3, 3.1), but it largely brackets the race dynamics that determine who holds the bargaining chips at the moment of takeoff. The failure mechanism is that any governance or reflection-heavy posture that delays decisive capability acquisition shifts relative advantage to actors who prioritize speed and control, and those are disproportionately the actors least constrained by de dicto “good.” That directly undermines the paper’s own prerequisite for partial AM-convergence to matter: representation among powerful decision-makers (3.5 “concentration of power”). The concrete consequence is that the world that actually reaches the bargaining table is the one produced by early winners, and early winners are selected for willingness to defect, cut corners, and lock in—exactly the “major blocker” regime the essay wants to set aside. If this objection holds, the essay’s Flourishing analysis is conditional on a political-economic trajectory that its own incentives push us away from.
