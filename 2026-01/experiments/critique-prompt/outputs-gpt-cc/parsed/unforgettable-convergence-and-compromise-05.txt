> Moral pluralism with even one group holding "this is absolutely intolerable" beliefs turns cooperative bargaining into a shakedown, since everyone else rationally caves to avoid infinite disvalue.

**“Lexicographic Blackmail Magnet”**: The paper argues that **moral trade plus partial AM‑convergence** implies **most views can get near-best outcomes cheaply**, because **small resource transfers can satiate easily-satisfied views and avoid worst conflicts**. Under moral uncertainty and the paper’s own emphasis on unbounded/negative‑leaning axiologies, the presence of even a small coalition with **lexicographic or effectively unbounded disvalue** (e.g., “any instance of X is intolerable,” “suffering is infinitely worse,” “certain taboos dominate all”) turns them into bargaining focal points: others become rationally compelled to pay them to prevent astronomically bad outcomes. This is not “threats” in the narrow sense; it is a structural property of bargaining when some utilities are unbounded/lexicographic, and it makes the outcome dominated by the most extreme constraints rather than by mutually beneficial trades. The paper’s taxonomy of bounded/unbounded views acknowledges stakes changes, but it doesn’t confront the implication that **moral pluralism + any lexicographic component collapses bargaining to appeasement**. If this holds, the paper would need a principled reason (and enforcement mechanism) to **cap, discount, or refuse** lexicographic claims—yet doing so undermines the moral-uncertainty motivation for accommodating many views in the first place.
