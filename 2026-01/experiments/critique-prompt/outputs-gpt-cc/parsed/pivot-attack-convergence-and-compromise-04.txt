> When the moral stakes are high enough—like digital suffering or coercion—many values become non-negotiable absolutes where no trade-off is acceptable, collapsing the surplus that makes the paper's optimistic bargaining story work.

“Anti-Compromise Values Dominate the Menu” (attacks Pivot 2: that voluntary exchange will realize large mutual gains because many moral views are resource-compatible or can accept compromise). The essay’s trade story works best when values are smooth, tradable, and locally satisfiable (“give me X resources, I’ll let you do Y”). But many of the very moral disagreements the paper itself highlights as future-critical—digital suffering, coercion, “creating beings designed to enjoy servitude,” population ethics, threats—often generate *lexical* or *constraint-like* preferences (no amount of bliss elsewhere compensates for forbidden acts; some acts must not occur anywhere). In those cases, the surplus that makes trade possible vanishes: the “price” of allowing the other side’s project is infinite, so the Nash-style compromise the paper relies on is infeasible except via coercion or deception. If anti-compromise values are common among the powerful, then the paper’s main pro-optimism channel (partial AM‑convergence + trade) breaks, and the paper’s updated flourishing estimate should drop sharply (or become bimodal: rare win/mostly loss). To address this, the paper would need to model the distribution of “constraint vs. tradable” moral psychologies post-AGI, and show why tradable ones dominate *at the margin that matters for cosmic resource allocation*.
