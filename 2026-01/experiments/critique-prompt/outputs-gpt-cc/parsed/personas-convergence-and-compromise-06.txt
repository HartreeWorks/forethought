[The Second-Order Catastrophist] The paper repeatedly uses “moral trade” as a salvation route (3.1–3.2), but if it succeeds at scale it also creates a civilization-level norm: “buy off dissent by carving out sovereign value fiefdoms.” The failure mode is that this legitimizes and institutionalizes the creation of vast, siloed zones optimized for incompatible moral projects—including projects that manufacture beings (digital minds, engineered animals) tailored to be exploitable, or that pursue extreme experiences with massive externalities—because the whole point of the system is to respect diverging terminal values. Even if everyone is “better off by their lights,” the compromise architecture expands the feasible set for atrocity-by-design: you can always argue that your zone is your paid-for moral entitlement. The concrete consequence is a cosmos partitioned into morally unaccountable micro-regimes where the global capacity to coordinate against shared hazards (weapons, runaway replication, information hazards) is permanently weakened, increasing tail risks that kill everyone, including the “good” zones. If this holds, the paper’s compromise mechanism trades local value for systemic fragility and higher extinction/lock-in probability.
