[The Empirical Hardliner — Measurement/identification failure] Target claim: the paper’s core move in the introduction that “narrow target doesn’t imply low probability” because societies can “hone in” like engineers (flight) or evolution (wings). Failure mechanism: your analogies smuggle in an identifiable objective function (lift/fitness) and a tight feedback loop, but you give no operational counterpart for “mostly-great future” that could actually generate gradient-following correction rather than post-hoc storytelling. In your own terms, you explicitly allow meta-ethical antirealism and “free parameters” about what experiences are best (2.4.2), which destroys the very thing that makes honing-in work: a shared loss function that punishes near-misses. Consequence: without an identifiable feedback signal, “honing in” is not a mechanism but a vibe, so the paper’s headline update (from “near 0” to “5–10% Flourishing”) is not supported by any causal model that could be wrong.
