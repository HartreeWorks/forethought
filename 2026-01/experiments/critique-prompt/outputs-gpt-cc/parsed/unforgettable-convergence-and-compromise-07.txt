**“Ironclad Contracts Require a Moral Constitution”**: The paper argues that **superintelligence enables iron-clad contracts**, which implies **lower transaction costs and more reliable moral trade**, because **enforcement and verification become technologically easy**. The hidden crux is that truly ironclad enforcement requires a **shared coercive substrate**—a platform, protocol, or authority that can compel compliance across powerful agents—and designing that substrate is itself a once-only, lock-in constitutional choice that must encode what counts as a valid contract, personhood, punishment, property, and adjudication. That pushes the problem back to near-WAM-level agreement at the constitutional layer: if coalitions disagree about what entities count, what harms are admissible, or what enforcement methods are permitted, you cannot get the “neutral” enforcement the trade story assumes. The paper treats “legal system preventing threats” as optional; this objection says the enforcement layer is **the** decisive battleground and cannot be value-neutral in the way the trade model needs. If this holds, the paper would need to shift from “trade among views” to “how to design a stable, value-pluralistic constitution” and show why that design problem is easier than WAM‑convergence.
