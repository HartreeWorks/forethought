Section 5’s recommendation to “act much more on the assumption that scenario (3) holds” relies on a pivotality premise: marginal effort in scenario (3) produces larger expected value gains than power-seeking in scenario (1), because scenario (1) is low-flourishing and your power share is tiny. A counterexample consistent with your scenario taxonomy is a threshold world where scenario (1) outcomes are winner-take-all among many non-convergent value systems; then increasing your power from 1e‑9 to 1e‑7 can move you from “never pivotal” to “occasionally pivotal” in a small set of decisive contests (e.g., controlling a key compute bottleneck or constitutional vote), producing discontinuously large expected value gains. Meanwhile in scenario (3), institutional robustness and convergence dilute individual marginal impact, making your non-powerseeking interventions less pivotal than assumed. If this critique holds, the paper must revise the EV comparison to include discontinuities and heavy-tailed pivotal events (not just proportional improvements), otherwise the “scenario (3) dominates for action” conclusion is not licensed.
