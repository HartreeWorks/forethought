> Hybrid goods that satisfy multiple value systems should get harder to find under the same extreme-optimization conditions the paper uses to argue moral views diverge, making the trade optimism self-undermining.

**“Hybrid Goods Mirage”**: The paper argues that **moral trade can rescue value despite ethical divergence**, because **compromise can find ‘hybrid goods’ that score well on multiple views**. But earlier, the paper’s core argument against convergence is that as optimization power increases, moral views pull apart sharply (hedonism vs preference satisfaction, etc.) and the shared “low-hanging fruit” disappears; that same reasoning implies the **hybrid-good set shrinks** exactly in the regime where cosmic resources are being optimized and where trade is supposed to do the rescuing. In other words, the essay’s divergence story and its trade optimism are in tension: the more you believe “no easy eutopia” plus high optimization, the less you should expect robust hybridization opportunities rather than brittle forks. This is self-undermining in a paper-specific way: the very mechanism used to argue WAM-convergence is unlikely also erodes the mechanism used to argue trade is promising. If this holds, the paper would need to justify why “hybrid goods” remain abundant under extreme optimization—perhaps by identifying deep shared structure across value theories—not merely by pointing to everyday compromise analogies.
