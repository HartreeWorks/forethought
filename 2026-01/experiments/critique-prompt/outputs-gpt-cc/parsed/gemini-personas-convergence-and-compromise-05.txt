[The Institutional Corruptionist] Target claim: “the right institutions exist to support trade” and realize large gains from moral trade (3.2). Failure mechanism: institutions don’t implement morality; they implement incentives and are immediately captured by whoever has concentrated power—exactly the “concentration of power” blocker you mention (3.5) but treat as a side condition instead of the default. Attack vector: Agent A funds the adjudication layer for moral trade, then defines “digital welfare,” “nature preservation,” and “threat” in a way that launders their own consumption as compliance while taxing rivals as “externalities.” Consequence: “moral trade” becomes compliance theater: a universal market for moral indulgences that legitimizes domination and strips dissenters of resources via proceduralism. Failure state outcome: the bargain outcome tracks principal-agent corruption (the enforcers’ interests), not any negotiated moral frontier, producing a cosmetically “compromised” but substantively predatory future.
