> Splitting galaxies between value systems sounds clean, but security commitments, global public goods like information control, and cross-bloc externalities mean spatial partition alone can't eliminate strategic conflict.

**“Partitioned Cosmos Fantasy”** — The trade optimism in §3.1–§3.2 repeatedly relies on examples like “Milky Way for commonsense utopia, other galaxies for utilitarian utopia,” implicitly treating resources as cleanly divisible with negligible externalities. The concrete failure mode is security and interdependence: in a post-AGI setting, the ability to credibly commit not to expand, not to build destabilizing capabilities, and not to interfere with others is itself a strategic scarce resource, so “splitting galaxies” does not eliminate conflict or threat incentives. Moreover, many value-relevant variables are global public goods (information control, cosmic security policy, replication rights, mind-creation rules, prevention of suffering exploits), so one bloc’s “local” choices can impose cross-bloc downside regardless of spatial partition. If this objection holds, the paper would need to replace the intuitive partition examples with a mechanism that survives realistic strategic constraints—e.g., a defensible account of enforceable non-interference, verifiable containment, and governance of shared-risk domains.
