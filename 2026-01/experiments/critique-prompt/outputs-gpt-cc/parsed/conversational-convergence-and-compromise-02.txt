> Moral reflection isn't a random walk—shared strategic pressures like bargaining, coordination, and legitimacy act as attractors that could drive convergence far more than the paper's drift metaphor suggests.

**"Moral reflection isn’t a random walk; it’s shaped by shared constraints"**  
A key intuition pump is that further reflection causes divergence like a random walk from a common origin. But human moral learning is not unconstrained drift: it is disciplined by shared empirical facts, coordination pressures, cognitive architecture, and repeated bargaining equilibria. Even under antirealism, reflection can converge because agents face similar strategic problems (credible commitment, bargaining, legitimacy, stability) that select for similar norms. The paper acknowledges coordination pressures today but treats them mainly as “conformity” rather than as evidence of deep convergence mechanisms. If convergence is more like optimization under shared constraints than a random walk, the paper may underestimate WAM-convergence (or at least underestimate convergence on a workable moral constitution).
