The essay repeatedly models “moral reflection” as something like independent random walks from a shared origin (2.2.1) and then treats post-AGI society as many agents doing “billions of reflection processes” (2.3.1), but it ignores that these processes are coupled through memetics, platform dynamics, and shared AI tooling. The failure mode is that coupling produces phase transitions: small early asymmetries in which advisors, training data, or rhetorical schemas become prestigious can lock in basin-of-attraction dominance, creating the illusion of convergence while actually being path-dependent herding. That undermines both of the essay’s key intuitions at once: divergence is not a smooth function of “more reflection,” and convergence is not evidence of truth-tracking—it can be an emergent contagion. The concrete consequence is that you can get fast, stable “convergence” onto a value system that is brittle, adversarially steerable, or optimized for legibility to the dominant advisory AIs, rather than for goodness de dicto. If this holds, the paper’s analysis of convergence likelihood based on individual-level reflection misses the real driver: ecosystem-level dynamics that can lock in catastrophically wrong attractors.
