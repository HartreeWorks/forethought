> When the deepest moral disagreements demand universal constraints—"no suffering *anywhere*"—there's nothing to partition or trade, undercutting the paper's core compromise mechanism.

**"Moral trade assumes separability and divisibility that future stakes may not allow"**  
The trade optimism often relies on splitting the cosmos (you get galaxies, I get galaxies) or finding “hybrid goods.” But many core moral disputes are non-separable: they concern universal constraints (e.g., “no suffering anywhere,” “no rights-violations anywhere,” “no creation of certain kinds of minds anywhere”), not local resource shares. For agents with deontic or negative-leaning commitments, allowing *any* prohibited practice in someone else’s region is still unacceptable, so there is no surplus to trade. Even for consequentialists, externalities (info hazards, security risks, runaway replication, value drift) can couple domains so strongly that “partitioning” doesn’t preserve what each party values. If the important disagreements are precisely the ones that *aren’t* tradable, the paper’s compromise route to “mostly-great” futures shrinks sharply.
