**“Anti-Realist Divergence Overreach”** — In §2.4.2 the paper argues that under anti-realism/subjectivist idealization there are too many “free parameters” for convergence, so shared human preferences are “underpowered” to hit a narrow target. The failure mechanism is that it ignores powerful convergence forces that don’t require objective moral facts: equilibrium selection under bargaining, shared cognitive architectures/reflective heuristics, common informational bottlenecks, and path-dependent norm-setting can all collapse a high-dimensional preference space into a small set of stable “focal” moral conventions. Even if idealization is subjective, agents might converge on the same idealization *procedure* because it is instrumentally dominant for coordination, legitimacy, and avoiding costly conflict—precisely the kinds of pressures the essay elsewhere emphasizes (e.g., conformity incentives in §2.2.1 and bargaining in §3). If this objection holds, the paper would need to model (or at least seriously integrate) these coordination-driven attractors and show that they are weak relative to the “free parameter” explosion, rather than assuming subjective reflection behaves like independent random walks.
