> The essay's optimism about cross-value trade assumes multiple sovereign actors reach the bargaining table, but a brief early "capture window" over compute and infrastructure could produce winner-take-most dynamics before pluralist bargaining ever gets off the ground.

“Bargaining Happens After the Land Grab” (attacks Pivot 5: that power will be sufficiently diffuse at the relevant time for trade/compromise to operate, rather than concentrated via early lock-in). The essay acknowledges concentration of power as a blocker, but its main optimistic update implicitly uses a world where enough semi-independent actors reach a bargaining table with meaningful outside options. In many plausible post-AGI trajectories, the highest-leverage step is a short, early “capture window” (control of frontier compute, enforcement infrastructure, replication, and space launch) that strongly favors winner-take-most dynamics before any stable, pluralist bargaining institutions exist. If the future is decided during that window, then “trade across value systems” becomes mostly counterfactual: there aren’t multiple sovereign value blocs to trade with, just a dominant coalition and compliant remnants. In that case, the argument that partial AM‑convergence plus trade makes mostly-great futures plausible collapses, and the paper’s conclusion that flourishing is plausibly 5–10% (rather than ~0) loses its main mechanism. To survive this objection, the paper would need to defend a specific governance/tech story where decisive strategic advantage is *prevented* or *delayed* until after enforceable pluralist bargaining norms are in place.
