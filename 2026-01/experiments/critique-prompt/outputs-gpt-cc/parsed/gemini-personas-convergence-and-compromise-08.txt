[The Historical Parallelist] Target claim: you lean on the “flight evolved” and “powered flight ubiquitous” analogy to suggest narrow targets can still be hit via honing (Introduction). Failure mechanism: you’re stealing credit from selection regimes with explicit fitness gradients and ruthless elimination; moral progress and cosmic governance don’t have a single scalar fitness function, and the “selection” you’d get is power selection, not value selection. Attack vector: Agent A imports the actual historical analogue—state formation and imperial competition—where the “honing” process optimizes for legibility, extraction, and control, not for flourishing or moral accuracy. Consequence: if your analogy is taken seriously, the expected endpoint is not eutopia-by-honing but empire-by-honing: standardized values, surveillance, and punitive capacity because those are what win competitions. Failure state outcome: you reproduce the worst historical pattern at astronomical scale: durable hegemonies justified as “coordination,” with dissent treated as defectors.
