“Self-undermining publication: you argue that merely thinking about threats increases them, yet the paper operationalizes threat-logic for future actors.” In 3.3 you explicitly note the literature is sparse partly because learning about threats can make them more likely, and you confess you haven’t dug in despite their importance. Then the essay proceeds to (a) highlight that small executed-threat fractions can destroy most value across many moral theories, and (b) normalize the idea that threats are a central bargaining tool in cosmic politics. By your own causal model, this is memetic hazard: you’re increasing the salience and perceived efficacy of extortion in exactly the population most likely to influence long-run bargaining norms. This is not an “oops, add a disclaimer” problem; it means the act of making your argument publicly may be anti-correlated with the good futures you’re trying to analyze, collapsing the paper into a performative contradiction. If you defend by saying “sunlight helps,” you must explain why threat strategies won’t be adopted faster than threat-prevention institutions—yet your own earlier sections argue institutions and convergence are unreliable, so the defense eats itself.
