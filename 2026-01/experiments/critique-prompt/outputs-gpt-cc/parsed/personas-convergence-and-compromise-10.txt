> In a world where AI advantage compounds at scale, power naturally concentrates into monopoly, so the paper's optimistic picture of pluralistic moral bargaining collapses—the dominant coalition dictates terms, not negotiates them.

The paper frames power concentration as a “blocker” to trade delivering a mostly-great future (3.5), but then treats it as one contingent factor among many rather than the default endpoint of capital, compute, and security competition in an AI economy. The failure mechanism is that in worlds where marginal advantage is strongly increasing in scale (better models → more resources → better models), you should expect monopoly/oligopoly control over compute, enforcement, and information, making the “meaningful fraction of people weighted by power” assumption (3’s partial AM-convergence) vanish. In that regime, “moral trade” is not negotiated among plural moral factions; it is offered as a take-it-or-leave-it product by the dominant coalition, with dissenters priced out, surveilled, or physically excluded from resource control. The concrete consequence is that the paper’s galaxy-partition compromise becomes a propaganda story told by winners while losers are denied bargaining standing, so the actual outcome tracks the dominant coalition’s ideology plus whatever concessions are cheapest for it to fake. If this holds, the essay’s central optimism lever—pluralistic bargaining among value-holders—fails for the same reason pluralistic bargaining fails under real-world hegemonies: power sets the terms, not moral insight or mutual gains.
