[The Capability Accelerationist] Target claim: your whole framing assumes there’s time for “post-AGI reflection,” bargaining, and iterative convergence (2.3, 3.1, 3.5). Failure mechanism: the decisive window is earlier than your essay wants to admit; capabilities races compress timelines so the first actor to cross key thresholds sets the terms, and everyone else bargains from zero. Attack vector: Agent A rushes deployment, triggers early lock-in (2.5), and then offers “moral trade” only after the cosmic property rights are already assigned by force and infrastructure. Consequence: trade becomes post-hoc appeasement: scraps for losers, not a path to “near-best” coexistence across galaxies (3.1). Failure state outcome: your proposed optimism channel systematically advantages the fastest, least constrained actor and punishes deliberation—so your recommendations select for the exact governance failure you’re trying to avoid.
