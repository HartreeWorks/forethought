> Even with superintelligent enforcement, contracts across radically different value systems break down because parties can't agree on what terms like "suffering" or "personhood" actually mean—and adversarial agents will exploit every ambiguity.

**"The feasibility of ‘iron-clad contracts’ and low transaction costs is overstated"**  
Even with superintelligence, contracting across value systems is not just a technical enforcement problem; it’s a specification and interpretation problem. Parties will disagree about what counts as compliance (e.g., what qualifies as “suffering,” “personhood,” “coercion,” “authentic preference,” “identity continuity”), and adversarial optimization will exploit ambiguity. Verification may be computationally and epistemically hard: you might not be able to audit distant regions, detect deceptive simulations, or validate that “promised welfare” is real rather than a fake metric. Strong contracts also introduce new vulnerabilities (backdoors, formalization errors, exploitably incomplete specifications). If enforceability and verifiability are limited, the clean Coasean picture of moral trade becomes far less credible.
