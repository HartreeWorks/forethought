**"Motivational psychology is modeled too simply (de dicto motivation may be instrumentally selected)"**  
The essay often treats “caring about the good de dicto” as rare and psychologically unnatural. But in advanced societies, agents and institutions may adopt de dicto morality as an *instrument* for trust, legitimacy, and stable coalition-building—especially when power is contestable and reputational systems are strong. Even self-interested actors may commit to impartial procedures because it reduces conflict and increases bargaining surplus. Over time, culturally evolved norms can internalize those commitments (the same way honesty norms often become genuine rather than purely strategic). If de dicto moral motivation can be selected for institutionally (rather than arising from pure philosophical reflection), the paper may underestimate its prevalence among power-holders.
