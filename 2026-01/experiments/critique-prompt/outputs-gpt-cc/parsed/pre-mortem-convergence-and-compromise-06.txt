"Flourishing-First Reallocation Crash" — The essay’s conclusion that holding the future back from *Flourishing* likely dominates *Surviving* in scale became a funder mantra in the late 2020s: budgets moved from catastrophe prevention (biosecurity, robust control, critical infrastructure resilience) to moral reflection tooling, compromise institutions, and long-horizon value research. The mechanism that broke was the implicit substitution: treating “more flourishing work” as approximately additive rather than conditional on survival; survival interventions had large option value and strong complementarities with any later moral deliberation. The cascade was that thinner safety margins allowed a series of compounding near-misses—then one combined cyber-bio incident in 2031 that would have been contained under the earlier redundancy regime, triggering global instability and permanent loss of high-trust coordination capacity. In the post-crash world, the very conditions the paper treated as “reasonably good” never reappeared, so neither convergence nor trade pathways could operate. The paper missed how strategic funding narratives get operationalized: not as nuanced portfolios, but as rebalancings that can push a system past a resilience threshold.
