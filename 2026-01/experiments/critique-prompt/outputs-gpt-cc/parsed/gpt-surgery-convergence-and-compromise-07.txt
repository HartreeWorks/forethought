In **§2.4.2 (antirealism)** you claim antirealists face “astronomical haystack” non-convergence because there are no “objective qualities of experiences” indicating value, so even utilitarians won’t converge on “best experiences.” **Attack type: Countermodel (shared structure despite antirealism).** Even under antirealism, convergence can arise from common architecture: many agents may share evolved reward circuitry, computational constraints, and preference-learning dynamics that strongly favor a narrow band of experience-types (stability, novelty balance, avoidance of wireheading-like collapse, narrative coherence). That creates de facto “objective-ish” attractors (not truth, but equilibrium) that your argument denies; the haystack can be sharply pruned by universal constraints on minds that remain agentic over long horizons. In that world, antirealism doesn’t imply broad divergence; it implies coordination on a few psychologically stable value-constructs. If this holds, you must either argue why post-AGI minds won’t share these constraints (radical self-modification breaks universals) or incorporate mind-design constraints as the main determinant of convergence rather than metaethics.
