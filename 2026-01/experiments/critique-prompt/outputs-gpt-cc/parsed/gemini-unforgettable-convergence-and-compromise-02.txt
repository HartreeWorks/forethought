“WAM-convergence is smuggled back in as the invisible prerequisite for ‘moral trade’.” You frame section 3 as an escape hatch from the improbability of widespread accurate motivational convergence: only a minority needs AM-converge and then bargain. But bargaining at cosmic scale requires a shared normative operating system—stable property claims, enforceable commitments, a threat-limiting equilibrium, and a notion of what counts as a valid contract rather than coercion. Those are not technicalities; they are precisely the kind of motivational and meta-ethical convergence you argued is unlikely under both realism (alien morality) and anti-realism (free parameters explode). Without that convergence, “trade” collapses into conflict, deception, and commitment races, i.e. the threats section you admit you haven’t dug into. If you defend by saying superintelligence enables “iron-clad contracts,” you’ve only solved enforcement, not legitimacy—iron-clad enforcement of illegitimate commitments is just perfected extortion.
