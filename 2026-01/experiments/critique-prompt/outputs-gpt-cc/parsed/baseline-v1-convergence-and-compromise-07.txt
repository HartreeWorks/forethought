The “abundance implies altruism” discussion leans on contestable utility-shape assumptions (rapidly diminishing self-interested marginal utility, slowly diminishing altruistic marginal utility) without establishing them for post-AGI agents or modified psychologies. The billionaire-philanthropy evidence is also an awkward proxy, since today’s giving is constrained by coordination problems, status incentives, institutional leakage, and non-resource bottlenecks that may not generalize to the post-scarcity setting the paper is analyzing.
