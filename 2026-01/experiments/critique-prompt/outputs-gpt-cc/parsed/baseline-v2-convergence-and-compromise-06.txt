> The "many free parameters means divergence" argument ignores that shared cognitive architecture, bargaining constraints, and coherence demands can create strong attractors even in high-dimensional ethical space.

"The Antirealism-to-Divergence Argument Overstates ‘Free Parameters’" — In 2.4.2 the author claims that absent objective moral facts, idealization is “underpowered” and convergence is unlikely because ethics has many free parameters (welfare theory, aggregation, experience ranking, etc.). But the paper treats the space of idealization procedures as if it were almost unconstrained, when in practice reflective equilibrium processes can be strongly shaped by shared cognitive architecture, shared social-functional needs, bargaining constraints, and shared desiderata like impartiality, coherence, and avoiding arbitrariness. The argument also assumes that high-dimensional parameter spaces imply divergence, yet many complex systems show attractors where diverse starting points converge due to structural constraints. Additionally, the paper’s “astronomical haystack” metaphor presumes that most value functions are extremely “spiky,” but that is precisely the narrow-target assumption in another guise. Without showing that reflective procedures lack robust attractors, the antirealist pessimism risks being an argument from intuitive vastness rather than a demonstrated improbability.
