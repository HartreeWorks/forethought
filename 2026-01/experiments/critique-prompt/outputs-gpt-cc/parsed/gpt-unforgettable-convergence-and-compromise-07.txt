**"Partial AM-Convergence is Not the Right Quantity"**: You repeatedly reason in terms of fractions of people who AM-converge (e.g., “not less than one in a million”), but in the post-AGI setting you describe, what matters is not headcount but control of scalable optimization—i.e., whether a tiny cluster can capture decisive power via capability feedback loops. The inference being attacked is: “If a non-tiny minority aims at the good, trade can secure a mostly-great future.” Step-by-step: AGI-era power tends to be superlinear in early advantage (compute, automation, coordination, security) → a small coalition can become the effective singleton or near-singleton regardless of its initial population fraction → bargaining becomes irrelevant because the dominant coalition’s disagreement point is “we take all.” If this objection holds, you must replace “meaningful fraction” talk with an explicit model of power scaling and capture (including security and takeoff dynamics), and show that the window for trade exists *before* decisive advantage collapses the bargaining set.
