**"Correct-View Double Bookkeeping"**: The paper’s evaluation machinery repeatedly relies on “the correct moral view” (e.g., “value of the world on the correct moral view after trade,” and the bounded/unbounded taxonomy), while your meta-ethics section treats antirealism/subjectivism as a live possibility that undercuts any privileged correctness notion. The key inference being attacked is: “Even under antirealism, we can still assess whether trade/convergence yields a mostly-great future.” Mechanism: if antirealism is true, then “correct view” collapses into agent-relative idealization outputs; but your later arguments require a single yardstick to say threats “eat most value,” to compare scenarios (1) vs (3), and to assign numbers like 5–10% Flourishing in a unified sense. If this objection holds, you need to rebuild the whole analysis in explicitly *non-single-metric* terms (e.g., a specified bargaining/parliament framework over moral uncertainty) or else explicitly conditionalize every “mostly-great” claim on realism (and accept that your optimism may vanish under the live antirealist branch you emphasize).
