“The ‘long views win’ argument secretly selects for the most dangerous strategies, not the most altruistic values.” In 2.3.3 you suggest patient, non-discounting agents may asymmetrically grow and thus dominate, hinting this could favor altruism. But patience is strategy-amplifying, not morality-amplifying: patient agents are precisely the ones who can credibly precommit, invest in commitment devices, and play multi-century bargaining games—the same ingredients that make threats and extortion credible and lucrative in your own section 3.3. If patient agents win, the equilibrium is not “altruists save more”; it is “the best commitment engineers win,” which under value pluralism tends toward coercive bargaining and preemptive lock-in. This is not an adjustable parameter; it’s the direction of selection pressure induced by your own institutional assumptions (trade, contracts, multi-agent bargaining). If you defend by insisting commitment tech will be used benevolently, you’re just assuming away the core strategic reason threats dominate—again reintroducing WAM through the back door.
