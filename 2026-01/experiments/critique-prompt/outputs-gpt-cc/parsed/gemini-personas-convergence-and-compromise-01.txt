[The Game-Theoretic Defector] Target claim: “partial AM-convergence + trade/compromise” can yield a mostly-great future (sections 3.1–3.4). Failure mechanism: as soon as “iron-clad contracts” make commitments credible, defection becomes programmable—Agent A commits to a bargaining position that extracts concessions, then uses the same enforcement machinery to prevent renegotiation forever. Attack vector: a coalition publicly adopts your “moral trade” language while privately optimizing for hold-up power, setting the disagreement point to “we burn value unless paid,” exactly the extortion pattern you flag in 3.3. Consequence: trade converges to a threat auction, where the equilibrium reward goes to whoever can credibly precommit to the most destructive fallback, not whoever has the “correct view.” Failure state outcome: most resources get allocated to commitment devices and punitive capability rather than any “hybrid good,” and your “mostly-great via compromise” path collapses into institutionalized blackmail.
