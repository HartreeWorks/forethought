**"Power and lock-in are treated as ‘blockers’ but may be the base case"**  
The essay cordons off extinction, lock-in, and concentration of power as blockers, then reasons “absent blockers.” But many plausible AGI transition stories make these “blockers” the modal trajectory rather than exceptional cases: rapid capability gains, first-mover advantages, security dilemmas, and winner-take-most dynamics. If early decisive actors can entrench governance, then later moral reflection and trade have little causal influence. The paper’s optimism depends on a relatively extended, pluralistic, high-trust bargaining period—yet that period is precisely what many alignment and geopolitical models predict we won’t get. Treating these as add-on caveats risks misweighting the scenario space.
