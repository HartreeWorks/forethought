[The Adversarial Red-Teamer] The paper acknowledges threats but treats them as a mostly endogenous bargaining pathology and notes limited public writing (3.3), while simultaneously proposing a world full of superintelligent delegates exploring countless reflection processes (2.3.1). The failure mode is that you have created the perfect substrate for adversarial threat discovery and deployment: automated agents can search the space of “cheap-to-inflict, expensive-to-prevent” harms tailored to each moral faction’s utility function (e.g., targeted suffering types that one faction weights astronomically). Once such threats exist, you don’t need widespread malevolence; you just need one actor (or one runaway delegate) to find a scalable extortion channel, and then everyone else rationally arms themselves with counter-threats. The concrete consequence is that the post-AGI negotiation environment becomes dominated by blackmail equilibria, not trade, because the marginal advantage of one more credible threat dwarfs the marginal gain from one more cooperative offer. If this holds, the essay’s “small fraction of resources devoted to executed threats” assumption is not stable; the system self-amplifies toward threat saturation.
