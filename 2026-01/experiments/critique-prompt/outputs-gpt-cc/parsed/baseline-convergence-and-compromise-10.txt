In section 5, the expected-impact comparison between power-seeking in scenario (1) and altruistic action in scenario (3) uses illustrative numbers but does not justify the probability assignments, the scaling assumptions, or the tractability estimates that drive the conclusion. This makes the recommendation feel like it depends on arbitrary parameter choices, and it also ignores that power-seeking might itself change which scenario obtains (e.g., by increasing coercion, lock-in, or threat dynamics) rather than being a neutral lever within a fixed scenario.
