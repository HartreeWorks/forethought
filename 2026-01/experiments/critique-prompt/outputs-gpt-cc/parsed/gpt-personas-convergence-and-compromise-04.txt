[The Institutional Corruption Realist — Hidden coupling / systems interaction] Target claim: “some kind of legal system which reliably prevents value-undermining threats” might exist and stabilize trade (3.3–3.4). Failure mechanism: any anti-threat legal regime has to define and police “value-destroying threats,” which requires institutionalizing a cross-axiology regulator that decides which commitments are illegitimate; that regulator becomes the highest-leverage object in the universe. Once you create that chokepoint, you couple “threat prevention” to “value enforcement,” i.e., whoever captures the regulator can label competitors’ bargaining moves as “threats” and their own coercion as “safety,” the classic compliance-theatre capture dynamic at cosmic scale. Consequence: your fix for threats is a machine for permanent ideological lock-in: it doesn’t merely fail under corruption, it *is* the lock-in event that makes the future “mostly-great” by some lights and an existential moral catastrophe by others.
