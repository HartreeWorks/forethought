**"The ‘Prevent Threats’ Governance Contradiction"**: You treat “preventing value-destroying threats” as a dominant priority across moral uncertainty, but your own argument that people won’t defer to the good de dicto (and will pick advisors aligned with their ideology) implies that any anti-threat regime powerful enough to work must be *value-contentful* and will be seen as ideological domination by many parties. The inference being attacked is: “A legal/institutional system that reliably prevents threats can be mutually agreeable and stable (or at least implementable) in the pluralistic future you describe.” Mechanism: threat-prevention requires policing credible commitments, punishment, and certain kinds of harm—i.e., it must decide which commitments are illegitimate and which harms count—so it effectively encodes a contested morality; then factions rationally view it as asymmetric disarmament and either refuse to join, route around it with private enforcement, or preempt it by capturing the institution first. If this objection holds, you need to redesign the proposal around *minimal*, non-morality-laden security constraints that can be endorsed from many value systems (or else admit that threat prevention collapses back into the “who has power at lock-in” problem, undermining the trade-based optimism rather than solving it).
