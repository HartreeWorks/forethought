"Empirical Claims About Wealth and Altruism Don’t Support the Extrapolation" — The paper uses current billionaire philanthropy rates to suggest that even massive future wealth may not increase proportional altruistic spending. But present-day philanthropy is a noisy proxy for altruistic motivation because it is entangled with taxation, reputational incentives, legal constraints, political capture, and the fact that most ‘spending’ by the rich takes the form of investment rather than consumption. More importantly, the inference from “today’s marginal giving patterns” to “post-AGI cosmic resource allocation” is a drastic extrapolation across radically different choice architectures, governance regimes, and agent types (uploads, AIs, modified humans). The argument also neglects that some models predict altruism increases with security and moral circle expansion, even if raw charitable donations do not. Because the empirical base is thin and the causal mechanisms are underspecified, the paper’s use of these data points risks functioning as mood music rather than evidence.
