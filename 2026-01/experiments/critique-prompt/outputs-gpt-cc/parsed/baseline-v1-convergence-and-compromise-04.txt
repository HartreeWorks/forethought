The realism/anti-realism fork in section 2.4 is presented as exhaustively framing convergence prospects, but it overlooks influential middle positions (constructivism, contractualism, ideal observer theories, response-dependence) that can predict convergence without “robust” realism. As a result, the argument risks a false dilemma: either objective weird moral truth that alienates agents, or radical divergence under subjectivism.
