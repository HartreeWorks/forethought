The realism argument in 2.4.1 depends on a “distance/alienness” premise: if moral realism is true, the correct morality is likely far from human preferences, hence even if learned it won’t motivate (or people will avoid learning it under internalism). This is doing heavy work because it turns realism from a convergence-helps story into a motivation-hurts story, supporting pessimism about WAM-convergence even conditional on realism. A counterexample is a fully realist but naturalist picture where moral facts strongly track human flourishing/relationship goods/anti-suffering constraints—so the correct view is *less* alien than today’s parochial norms and is motivationally resonant (e.g., “compassion generalizes,” “coercion corrupts”), making internalism an engine of motivation rather than avoidance. In that world, realism yields both convergence and motivation; your realism-based pessimism flips sign. To survive this critique, the paper needs to defend (not assume) that realism makes the correct view “weird” in the relevant motivational sense—e.g., by showing that the probability mass of plausible realist theories is concentrated on ones that demand extreme impartiality or radical experience-optimization that humans would reject.
