"Advisor Cartel Convergence" — The essay’s discussion of post-AGI reflection treated superintelligent moral advice as increasing cognitive capacity but not guaranteeing convergence; policymakers took this as license to build a “market of moral advisors” and let people choose. The mechanism that broke was correlated failure: economies of scale and regulatory certification pushed nearly everyone onto a small family of advisor models trained with similar reward signals (legal compliance, user retention, “reasonableness”), yielding an *appearance* of broad AM-convergence. The cascade was that institutions then treated this manufactured convergence as evidence of moral truth and baked it into constitutional defaults, while minority views lost representation because “the advisors have settled it,” and later attempts to diversify were blocked by path-dependent standards and compatibility constraints across the advisor ecosystem. When audits eventually revealed systematic bias (stemming from training on early‑2030s elite discourse and safety filters that encoded particular meta-ethical priors), the moral and legal order had already been optimized around a spurious consensus. The paper missed the market-structure dynamics by which “reflection help” becomes an epistemic monoculture—turning a convergence question into an industrial-organization problem.
