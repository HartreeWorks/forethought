The threats discussion in 3.3 is load-bearing for downgrading the trade pathway (“even small executed threats can eat into expected value”), but it quietly assumes that credible commitment to value-destroying actions is easy and not systematically deterred by equilibrium enforcement. A counter-model that preserves your “iron-clad contracts” premise is: superintelligence-enabled verification makes threat-making *publicly attributable and precommittable to punishment*, so coalitions adopt a meta-constitution (“threateners are expropriated / sandboxed”) that is mutually beneficial even to many self-interested actors because it eliminates extortion tax and increases expected surplus. In that world, the mere availability of credible commitments does not increase threats; it enables anti-threat enforcement, and the paper’s pessimistic weighting of threats flips. If this critique holds, you must either (i) show why anti-threat constitutions are unstable (e.g., because punishment itself creates new threat surfaces), or (ii) condition the threat risk on specific informational/attribution failures rather than on “credible commitment exists.”
