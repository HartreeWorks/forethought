**“Flourishing Without a Ruler”** — The paper’s central update (from ~1% to ~5–10% “Flourishing,” and the claim that arguments here rule out “Flourishing close to 0”) relies on an undefined target variable: what exactly counts as a “mostly-great future,” how “value” is aggregated across beings, and what “% of what it might be” means. Because the essay intentionally ranges over realism vs anti-realism, bounded vs unbounded value, separate vs joint aggregation, and threat sensitivity, the denominator (“what it might be”) and threshold (“mostly-great”) shift across frameworks; this makes the headline probabilistic update hard to interpret and easy to make true by tacitly changing evaluative standards midstream. The failure mechanism is equivocation: different sections implicitly use different yardsticks (e.g., trade looks good on resource-compatible, bounded views; threats dominate on negative-leaning or unbounded-below views), but the conclusion reports a single scalar. If this objection holds, the paper would need to (i) define a stable metric (or a small menu of metrics) and (ii) show that the optimism update is robust across them, rather than coming from selecting a favorable subset.
