[The Empirical Hardliner] The paper leans on the claim that “moral trade” plus superintelligence-enabled low transaction costs can make partial AM-convergence sufficient for a mostly-great future (sections 3.1–3.2), but it never specifies a causal model that maps (a) distribution of moral views, (b) bargaining protocols, and (c) enforcement tech into a falsifiable prediction about post-trade value. The failure mode is that the argument is doing analogy-swapping (“coins,” “galaxies”) rather than identifying measurable mechanisms (e.g., how often resource-compatibility exists in high-dimensional preference spaces, or how bargaining outcomes shift as utilities become linear). Without at least toy formalization, “enormous gains from trade” is not a prediction but a vibe that could flip sign under small changes (e.g., from divisible to indivisible resources, or from symmetric to asymmetric outside options). Concretely, the essay’s update from ~1% to ~5–10% Flourishing risks being numerology: the same narrative would still sound persuasive even if the true post-AGI bargaining dynamics systematically destroy value on most plausible axiologies. If this objection holds, the paper’s central practical implication—tilting attention from Surviving to Flourishing failure modes—rests on an unfalsified, potentially backward causal story.
