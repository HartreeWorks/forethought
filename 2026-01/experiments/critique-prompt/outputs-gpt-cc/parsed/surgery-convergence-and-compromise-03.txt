> The reference class of "unconstrained ethical exploration" may be wrong—shared decision-theoretic constraints, bargaining dynamics, and stability requirements could sharply prune the space even without moral realism.

**Load-bearing claim:**
without objective moral facts, “free parameters” in ethics make convergence across reflective processes very unlikely, so WAM-convergence is improbable

**Attack type:**
Reference class failure

The paper implicitly treats “ethical reflection” as unconstrained exploration in a huge possibility space, but in a post-AGI world the relevant reflective procedures may be *heavily regularized* by shared architectures: common decision-theoretic requirements (time consistency, dynamic stability), common bargaining solution concepts, and common safety constraints against self-modification pathologies. Those constraints are not “moral facts” yet still prune the space sharply, making convergence plausible even under subjectivism (e.g., convergence on broadly similar impartial aggregation rules because they are uniquely stable under reflection plus bargaining). If this critique holds, antirealism does not robustly imply divergence at the level needed for the paper’s pessimism, weakening the inference from “no objective truth” → “no WAM-convergence” → “trade is the main hope.”
