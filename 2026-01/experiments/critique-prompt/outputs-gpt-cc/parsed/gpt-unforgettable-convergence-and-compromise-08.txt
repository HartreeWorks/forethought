**"The Scenario-3 Policy Boomerang"**: In section 5 you recommend acting more as if scenario (3) holds because the best actions then have higher impact than personal power-seeking in scenario (1), but your own earlier analysis implies that many “scenario (3) actions” (building bargaining infrastructure, making moral trade salient, legitimizing cosmic negotiation) increase the surface area for threats and extortion if scenario (1) or even weak-(3) is true. The inference being attacked is: “Focusing on (3) is robustly higher-EV because it targets bigger upside.” Mechanism: institutions that enable credible commitment and low transaction costs are dual-use: they also enable credible threats, rapid enforcement of extortion, and fine-grained exploitation of minority values—exactly the failure mode you highlight as able to erase most value under many axiologies. If this objection holds, you need a decision rule that is *strategy-robust across scenarios* (e.g., prioritize measures that reduce threat capacity even if they slow trade), otherwise your practical takeaway reverses: the “cooperation-enabling” agenda can be net-negative under the very uncertainty you foreground.
