> When minds can copy and merge, their utility curvature stops being a stable input to fairness protocols and becomes a strategically manipulable output, triggering endless renegotiation spirals.

"Curvature Drift Misfire" — The paper put heavy weight on whether the “correct view” (and prevailing views) are bounded vs unbounded and linear-in-resources, and institutions copied this by building bargaining protocols and welfare accounting around inferred utility curvature (assuming curvature is a stable descriptor of a value system). The mechanism that broke was endogenous curvature drift: as people gained the ability to copy, shard, and merge minds, their revealed preferences over resources changed non-smoothly and became contingent on replication policies, identity accounting, and memory continuity settings. The cascade was that protocols optimized for yesterday’s curvature produced allocations that created tomorrow’s curvature shifts (e.g., incentivizing identity splits to claim more “linear” entitlement), which in turn broke the fairness assumptions of the next negotiation round, leading to perpetual renegotiation, legitimacy crises, and finally rule by emergency decree. The paper missed that “linear vs diminishing” is not just a moral-theory parameter; it becomes a manipulable outcome variable once minds and identities are programmable.
