1. “Your ‘narrow island’ is a mirage because the crew can move the island.” The paper’s load-bearing metaphor treats “mostly-great futures” as a fixed target in an objective space, like flight or an island, that selection or design can hone in on. But in your own setup, post‑AGI agents can self-modify, adopt constrained reflection, or pick advisors that hard-code preferred starting points—so the “target” is endogenous to the optimization process, not an external objective. Once the target moves with the optimizer, “honing in” ceases to be evidence of getting it right; it becomes evidence only of locking in whatever the optimizer chose to want. This isn’t patchable by tweaking the analogy, because the entire argumentative shape (narrow target + optimization ⇒ plausible success) depends on target fixedness. If you try to defend by asserting a “true” target (moral realism), you immediately contradict later reliance on pluralism/trade and reintroduce the motivation gap you already concede is fatal.

2. “WAM-convergence is smuggled back in as the invisible prerequisite for ‘moral trade’.” You frame section 3 as an escape hatch from the improbability of widespread accurate motivational convergence: only a minority needs AM-converge and then bargain. But bargaining at cosmic scale requires a shared normative operating system—stable property claims, enforceable commitments, a threat-limiting equilibrium, and a notion of what counts as a valid contract rather than coercion. Those are not technicalities; they are precisely the kind of motivational and meta-ethical convergence you argued is unlikely under both realism (alien morality) and anti-realism (free parameters explode). Without that convergence, “trade” collapses into conflict, deception, and commitment races, i.e. the threats section you admit you haven’t dug into. If you defend by saying superintelligence enables “iron-clad contracts,” you’ve only solved enforcement, not legitimacy—iron-clad enforcement of illegitimate commitments is just perfected extortion.

3. “Perverse instantiation: your logic recommends manufacturing hostages as a growth industry.” In your own framework, threats can dominate expected value because small fractions of resources devoted to executed threats can wipe out most value on many plausible axiologies (negative-leaning, bounded-above/unbounded-below, separate aggregation). Now combine that with your claim that future agents will have enormous optimization power and many will have linear, non-discounting preferences; the rational play becomes to create cheaply-torturable moral patients (e.g., digital minds engineered for maximal suffering per joule) as bargaining chips. This follows your rules exactly: it’s the most cost-effective lever against a wide class of views that “care a lot about bads,” and you explicitly note that mere awareness can increase threat incidence. This is not a “we should add safeguards” issue; it flips your trade optimism into a theorem of catastrophic incentive gradients. If you defend by proposing a no-threat legal regime, you must explain why extortionists—who gain the most from defecting—would bind themselves to it without already sharing the very moral motivation your paper says we shouldn’t expect.

4. “The paper’s central optimism is numerology because your value model makes expectation undefined.” You casually update from “<1%” to “5–10% Flourishing,” but your own taxonomy repeatedly entertains unbounded value above, unbounded disvalue below, separate aggregation, and heavy weight on bads—exactly the conditions under which expected value is typically dominated, undefined, or hypersensitive to tiny probability mass in tails. In that regime, talking about “5–10% of what it might be” is not a rough estimate; it’s a category error, because “what it might be” is not a finite yardstick and the ratio is not stable under small modeling changes. This isn’t fixable by adding caveats: the quantitative posture is doing rhetorical work (tempering despair, motivating a portfolio) while the underlying axiological space you describe makes that posture illegitimate. If you defend by bounding utilities, you erase much of the paper’s own argumentation about threats and “no easy eutopia,” which depends on extreme sensitivity to bads and tail outcomes.

5. “Vacuous truth: ‘accurate convergence’ is either impossible (anti-realism) or motivationally toxic (realism), so the thesis reduces to ‘good happens if people want good.’” Section 2.4 tries to be meta-ethically ecumenical, but the structure is a trap of your own making: under anti-realism you concede there is no objective target to converge to, and under realism you argue the target is likely alien and demotivating (or avoided via motivated ignorance under internalism). That means WAM-convergence is either incoherent as “accuracy” (anti-realism) or self-negating as “motivation” (realism), leaving your optimistic scenario resting on a conditional that cannot stably obtain. The paper then proceeds as if WAM is a meaningful benchmark and treats failure to reach it as contingent rather than conceptual. This isn’t a definitional quibble; it means the central partition of possibilities (WAM / partial AM+trade / nobody aims) is built on a predicate that dissolves when you inspect it with the very meta-ethics you invoke. If you defend by redefining “accuracy” pragmatically (e.g., “endorsed by ideal reflection”), you reopen the free-parameter explosion you used to argue convergence is unlikely, so you’ve just moved the impossibility sign one step back.

6. “Your ‘abundance ⇒ altruism’ mechanism predicts the opposite once self-modification is allowed.” The diminishing marginal utility story in 2.3.2 relies on stable preference curvature: people eventually satisfy selfish wants and then allocate margin to altruism. But you also emphasize post‑AGI agents can change their nature dramatically; in that world, an agent who wants to remain selfish can simply edit their utility function to keep selfish returns linear/convex, ensuring they never “run out” of self-interested marginal value. Your own examples (collector’s shrines, positional rivalry, copies of oneself) already gesture at exactly these convexifiers, and abundance makes self-modification cheaper, not harder. So the mechanism that is supposed to create moral breathing room actually creates an arms race in preference hardening, where the agents least inclined to share can immunize themselves against diminishing returns and outcompete. If you defend by saying “most won’t self-modify that way,” you’re back to relying on motivational convergence or benign cultural selection—again, the thing you argued we shouldn’t expect.

7. “The ‘long views win’ argument secretly selects for the most dangerous strategies, not the most altruistic values.” In 2.3.3 you suggest patient, non-discounting agents may asymmetrically grow and thus dominate, hinting this could favor altruism. But patience is strategy-amplifying, not morality-amplifying: patient agents are precisely the ones who can credibly precommit, invest in commitment devices, and play multi-century bargaining games—the same ingredients that make threats and extortion credible and lucrative in your own section 3.3. If patient agents win, the equilibrium is not “altruists save more”; it is “the best commitment engineers win,” which under value pluralism tends toward coercive bargaining and preemptive lock-in. This is not an adjustable parameter; it’s the direction of selection pressure induced by your own institutional assumptions (trade, contracts, multi-agent bargaining). If you defend by insisting commitment tech will be used benevolently, you’re just assuming away the core strategic reason threats dominate—again reintroducing WAM through the back door.

8. “Resource-splitting is a hidden crux: most moral views you cite are not separable, so ‘galaxies for everyone’ doesn’t buy peace.” Your flagship compromise picture—different groups take different galaxies and each gets near-best-by-their-lights—assumes values are localizable and that disvalue doesn’t arise merely from others doing their thing elsewhere. But many of the very disputes you highlight (worship one deity vs another, threats, deontic constraints, integrity/complicity, rights violations, population ethics, treatment of created minds) are globally sensitive: a view can assign massive negative value to the existence of certain practices anywhere, not just in “my region.” Once you admit negative-leaning axiologies and heavy bad-weighting (which you do), separability fails catastrophically, and trade no longer has positive-sum structure—it becomes a fight over universal injunctions. This isn’t solvable by “finding hybrid goods,” because non-separability is precisely the claim that hybrids don’t compensate for violations. If you defend by restricting to separable welfarist views, you’ve amputated most of the moral uncertainty you use to motivate the paper’s framework and made your earlier “no easy eutopia” premise far less credible.

9. “Your own evidence supports the opposite conclusion: ‘moral convergence’ historically tracks power, so future ‘convergence’ is just whoever controls persuasion tech.” You cite cases where values changed through conquest, state pressure, or coordination incentives (Mormon polygamy, abolition under British pressure, post‑WWII value shifts), and you treat this as a reason current agreement is shallow and contingent. But the reversal is damning: if convergence is primarily a function of coercion, memetic power, and institutional leverage, then post‑AGI “reflection” is not the driver of convergence—control over AI advisors, narrative tools, and enforcement is. That undermines both WAM (because it won’t track truth) and trade (because bargainers won’t be stable agents with fixed preferences; they’ll be targets of preference-shaping). In that world, the correct forecast is not “partial AM-convergence + bargains”; it’s “whoever wins the preference-shaping stack manufactures a pseudo-consensus,” making your optimism about negotiated pluralism naïve. If you defend by appealing to “reasonably good conditions,” you’re effectively assuming away the central technological fact you yourself emphasize: that persuasion and self-modification become astronomically powerful.

10. “Self-undermining publication: you argue that merely thinking about threats increases them, yet the paper operationalizes threat-logic for future actors.” In 3.3 you explicitly note the literature is sparse partly because learning about threats can make them more likely, and you confess you haven’t dug in despite their importance. Then the essay proceeds to (a) highlight that small executed-threat fractions can destroy most value across many moral theories, and (b) normalize the idea that threats are a central bargaining tool in cosmic politics. By your own causal model, this is memetic hazard: you’re increasing the salience and perceived efficacy of extortion in exactly the population most likely to influence long-run bargaining norms. This is not an “oops, add a disclaimer” problem; it means the act of making your argument publicly may be anti-correlated with the good futures you’re trying to analyze, collapsing the paper into a performative contradiction. If you defend by saying “sunlight helps,” you must explain why threat strategies won’t be adopted faster than threat-prevention institutions—yet your own earlier sections argue institutions and convergence are unreliable, so the defense eats itself.
