1. **“Flourishing Without a Ruler”** — The paper’s central update (from ~1% to ~5–10% “Flourishing,” and the claim that arguments here rule out “Flourishing close to 0”) relies on an undefined target variable: what exactly counts as a “mostly-great future,” how “value” is aggregated across beings, and what “% of what it might be” means. Because the essay intentionally ranges over realism vs anti-realism, bounded vs unbounded value, separate vs joint aggregation, and threat sensitivity, the denominator (“what it might be”) and threshold (“mostly-great”) shift across frameworks; this makes the headline probabilistic update hard to interpret and easy to make true by tacitly changing evaluative standards midstream. The failure mechanism is equivocation: different sections implicitly use different yardsticks (e.g., trade looks good on resource-compatible, bounded views; threats dominate on negative-leaning or unbounded-below views), but the conclusion reports a single scalar. If this objection holds, the paper would need to (i) define a stable metric (or a small menu of metrics) and (ii) show that the optimism update is robust across them, rather than coming from selecting a favorable subset.

2. **“Alien Realism Leap”** — In §2.4.1 the paper leans on the inference that *if moral realism is true, the correct moral view is “likely” to be distant/alien and thus non-motivating*, which helps drive pessimism about WAM-convergence. The concrete failure mode is that this is an unsupported distributional claim about the content of moral facts: realism by itself doesn’t privilege “weird” truths over “nearby” truths, and many realist pictures (e.g., functionalist or constructivist-leaning realisms, or realisms where reasons are anchored in widely shared agency conditions) would predict substantial overlap with broadly human concerns. Without an argument about why moral facts should be orthogonal to evolved/social preferences (rather than partially tracking them), the “alienness” step looks like importing the “no easy eutopia” narrow-target premise into the metaethics, rather than deriving it. If this objection holds, the paper would need either a substantive argument for why moral truth is likely to be motivationally off-manifold for most agents, or else to treat realism as significantly more convergence-friendly than the essay currently allows.

3. **“Anti-Realist Divergence Overreach”** — In §2.4.2 the paper argues that under anti-realism/subjectivist idealization there are too many “free parameters” for convergence, so shared human preferences are “underpowered” to hit a narrow target. The failure mechanism is that it ignores powerful convergence forces that don’t require objective moral facts: equilibrium selection under bargaining, shared cognitive architectures/reflective heuristics, common informational bottlenecks, and path-dependent norm-setting can all collapse a high-dimensional preference space into a small set of stable “focal” moral conventions. Even if idealization is subjective, agents might converge on the same idealization *procedure* because it is instrumentally dominant for coordination, legitimacy, and avoiding costly conflict—precisely the kinds of pressures the essay elsewhere emphasizes (e.g., conformity incentives in §2.2.1 and bargaining in §3). If this objection holds, the paper would need to model (or at least seriously integrate) these coordination-driven attractors and show that they are weak relative to the “free parameter” explosion, rather than assuming subjective reflection behaves like independent random walks.

4. **“Partitioned Cosmos Fantasy”** — The trade optimism in §3.1–§3.2 repeatedly relies on examples like “Milky Way for commonsense utopia, other galaxies for utilitarian utopia,” implicitly treating resources as cleanly divisible with negligible externalities. The concrete failure mode is security and interdependence: in a post-AGI setting, the ability to credibly commit not to expand, not to build destabilizing capabilities, and not to interfere with others is itself a strategic scarce resource, so “splitting galaxies” does not eliminate conflict or threat incentives. Moreover, many value-relevant variables are global public goods (information control, cosmic security policy, replication rights, mind-creation rules, prevention of suffering exploits), so one bloc’s “local” choices can impose cross-bloc downside regardless of spatial partition. If this objection holds, the paper would need to replace the intuitive partition examples with a mechanism that survives realistic strategic constraints—e.g., a defensible account of enforceable non-interference, verifiable containment, and governance of shared-risk domains.

5. **“Trade Needs a Shared Threat Model”** — The paper’s pro-trade story assumes that with low transaction costs and strong contracts, moral trade will realize large gains (§3.1), but the threat discussion (§3.3) concedes the authors “have not particularly dug into” extortion dynamics while also suggesting even small executed-threat risk can wipe out value on many views. The failure mechanism is that these are not separable: the very institutions that enable credible commitment and enforcement (and thus trade) also enable credible coercion, blackmail, and commitment races, and the equilibrium selection between “trade world” and “threat world” depends on detailed mechanism design. Without a model of how a society gets (and stays) in the cooperative equilibrium rather than the extortion equilibrium, the net sign of “trade increases expected Flourishing” is underdetermined. If this objection holds, the paper would need to make its optimism conditional on specific anti-extortion governance designs and argue that those designs are stable under the same power and bargaining assumptions the essay uses elsewhere.

6. **“Linear-Utility Handwave”** — Several pivotal claims hinge on whether dominant agents have approximately linear-in-resources preferences (e.g., §2.3.2’s discussion of which preferences dominate under abundance and §3.2’s claim that mutual gains from trade are “especially unlikely” among non-discounting linear views). The failure mechanism is that “linear” here does enormous work but is neither operationalized nor justified as a likely limiting form for real post-AGI agents; small deviations (bounded satiation, lexicographic constraints, risk-sensitive curvature, or multi-attribute diminishing returns) can radically change both how much altruism emerges under abundance and how much compromise is feasible. Because the essay’s trade pessimism is sharply higher for “linear views” than for others, this classification choice can flip conclusions while sounding like a technicality. If this objection holds, the paper would need either empirical/theoretical grounding for expecting approximate linearity to dominate, or sensitivity analysis showing that the main conclusions about trade and compromise don’t depend on this knife-edge preference-shape assumption.

7. **“Billionaire Philanthropy as a Broken Proxy”** — In §2.3.2 the paper uses contemporary billionaire giving rates to “weakly suggest” that vastly increased wealth won’t increase altruistic spending shares, countering the diminishing-returns-to-selfish-consumption argument. The concrete failure mode is external validity: today’s billionaire philanthropy is entangled with signaling, tax strategy, reputational equilibria, institutional constraints, and limited action channels, none of which resembles a post-AGI environment with radically expanded feasible altruistic action and different social incentives. If the proxy is invalid, the essay loses one of its main empirical anchors against abundance-driven altruism, leaving the section’s net takeaway largely impressionistic. If this objection holds, the paper would need to either (i) defend why billionaire behavior is predictive under the relevant counterfactuals or (ii) substitute a better-matched evidence base/model (e.g., behavior under near-satiation in controlled settings, or agent-based simulations with expanded action spaces).

8. **“Partial AM-Convergence + Power Distribution Gap”** — The core hopeful pathway is “partial AM-convergence” (as high as ≥1-in-a-million) plus trade (§3), but the essay simultaneously flags concentration of power (§3.5) and early lock-in (§2.5) as major blockers without integrating them into the viability of the pathway. The failure mechanism is that the relevant quantity is not the fraction of people who AM-converge, but the fraction of *decisive strategic control* held by AM-convergers during the narrow time window when lock-in occurs; in many plausible post-AGI transitions, that share could be far below 10⁻⁶ even if AM-convergers exist, making trade moot. By not connecting partial convergence rates to plausible power-law distributions of control, the paper risks overstating the probability mass of its favored route to “mostly-great.” If this objection holds, the paper would need to explicitly model (even at a back-of-the-envelope level) the joint distribution of (AM-convergence incidence × control concentration × timing of lock-in) and show that the trade pathway remains live under realistic tails.

9. **“Threat Sensitivity as a Dominant, Unquantified Driver”** — The essay argues that executed threats can “easily eat into” expected value and might even make futures “worse than extinction” (§3.3–§3.4), and then uses that to recommend prioritizing threat prevention. The failure mechanism is that the conclusion is doing expected-value arithmetic without any handle on base rates, tractability, or equilibrium prevalence of threats once advanced agents can precommit, self-modify, and strategically signal; depending on those parameters, “threat world” could be vanishingly rare or overwhelmingly dominant. Because the essay treats threats as both under-researched and potentially value-dominating, its practical and evaluative conclusions become extremely sensitive to a parameter it explicitly does not estimate. If this objection holds, the paper would need to either bound the threat prevalence with argument/data or else downgrade several downstream claims (including the relative optimism about trade and the prioritization suggestions) to explicitly conditional statements.

10. **“Scenario (3) Action Guidance Uses Arbitrary Counterfactuals”** — In §5 the paper argues we should act more as if we are in broad-convergence scenario (3) rather than near-zero convergence scenario (1), partly because “best actions are higher-impact” in (3) and because stakes may be lower in (1). The failure mechanism is that the numerical comparison (power shares, “one hundred millionth as much value,” 80% survive/10% flourish) is not derived from the essay’s earlier analysis and can be tuned to make almost any strategy look best; meanwhile, the argument ignores that interventions can change which scenario obtains (e.g., institution-building might increase convergence, while power-seeking might decrease it), so the scenarios are not decision-externals. If this objection holds, the paper would need a decision-theoretic treatment where actions affect the probability of (1)/(3), and where “impact” is not illustrated by free-floating numbers but linked to the paper’s earlier causal claims about convergence, trade feasibility, and blockers.
