1. [The Empirical Hardliner] The paper leans on the claim that “moral trade” plus superintelligence-enabled low transaction costs can make partial AM-convergence sufficient for a mostly-great future (sections 3.1–3.2), but it never specifies a causal model that maps (a) distribution of moral views, (b) bargaining protocols, and (c) enforcement tech into a falsifiable prediction about post-trade value. The failure mode is that the argument is doing analogy-swapping (“coins,” “galaxies”) rather than identifying measurable mechanisms (e.g., how often resource-compatibility exists in high-dimensional preference spaces, or how bargaining outcomes shift as utilities become linear). Without at least toy formalization, “enormous gains from trade” is not a prediction but a vibe that could flip sign under small changes (e.g., from divisible to indivisible resources, or from symmetric to asymmetric outside options). Concretely, the essay’s update from ~1% to ~5–10% Flourishing risks being numerology: the same narrative would still sound persuasive even if the true post-AGI bargaining dynamics systematically destroy value on most plausible axiologies. If this objection holds, the paper’s central practical implication—tilting attention from Surviving to Flourishing failure modes—rests on an unfalsified, potentially backward causal story.

2. [The Game-Theoretic Defector] The paper’s optimism about compromise relies on the idea that agents with different values will voluntarily implement mutually beneficial trades once contracts are “iron-clad” and compute is abundant (3.1), but it ignores that the dominant strategy in many bargaining games is to invest in credible commitment to being uncooperative. The failure mechanism is simple: if “being the type that won’t concede” improves your bargaining position across many interactions, then selection favors agents (and delegated AIs) that precommit to hardline policies, even when cooperation is Pareto-improving. That dynamic is intensified by the paper’s own assumption of linear, non-discounting utilities (3.2–3.4), where small concessions scale to astronomical opportunity costs and thus hardline stances become more rational, not less. The concrete consequence is that instead of galaxy-splitting compromises, you get “commitment races” where factions burn resources to make threats and refusal credible, shrinking the feasible set of deals and increasing conflict probability. If this holds, the trade pathway is not the default in a compute-rich world; it’s the equilibrium exception.

3. [The Mechanism Designer] The paper claims that superintelligence could enable “iron-clad contracts” and thereby unlock moral trade (3.1), but it never specifies what the contract actually ranges over when the objects being traded are future causal control and potentially self-modifying agents. The failure mode is that the enforceability of a contract depends on state observability, identity persistence, and non-circumventability—exactly the things that break when parties can fork, merge, rewrite preferences, or spin off unaccountable delegates. In mechanism terms, you can’t just assert low transaction costs; you have to define the message space, enforcement primitives, and what prevents off-contract side channels (e.g., creating copies that weren’t signatories, or moving resources into hidden substrates). The concrete consequence is that the “contract solves trust” assumption collapses precisely in the highest-stakes bargains (allocation of galaxies, creation of digital minds, threat-prevention regimes), leaving you with informal power contests rather than trade. If this objection holds, section 3’s main enabling technology is underspecified to the point of being fictional, so the compromise story cannot carry the weight the essay puts on it.

4. [The Institutional Corruptionist] The paper’s discussion of preventing value-destroying threats implicitly assumes the possibility of a broadly stable, mutually agreeable “legal system” that deters threats without being gamed (3.3–3.4), but it ignores that any such system becomes the prime target for capture. The failure mechanism is classic principal–agent failure at cosmic scale: the enforcement apparatus (courts, auditors, monitoring AIs) accrues discretionary power and informational advantage, and then optimizes for its own continuation, allies, and ideological constituency rather than “threat minimization.” Once captured, anti-threat rules become selectively enforced tools for suppressing disfavored moral minorities (“your project counts as a threat”) while permitting extortionate behavior by insiders (“security exceptions”). The concrete consequence is that the very institution meant to prevent executed threats becomes the highest-leverage threat generator, because it can credibly punish noncompliance and reclassify rivals as violators. If this holds, the paper’s proposed fix for threats is not a stabilizer; it is a path to durable coercive lock-in under the banner of “threat prevention.”

5. [The Capability Accelerationist] The paper treats post-AGI abundance and superintelligent deliberation as if they arrive under “reasonably good conditions” and then society gets to bargain (2.3, 3.1), but it largely brackets the race dynamics that determine who holds the bargaining chips at the moment of takeoff. The failure mechanism is that any governance or reflection-heavy posture that delays decisive capability acquisition shifts relative advantage to actors who prioritize speed and control, and those are disproportionately the actors least constrained by de dicto “good.” That directly undermines the paper’s own prerequisite for partial AM-convergence to matter: representation among powerful decision-makers (3.5 “concentration of power”). The concrete consequence is that the world that actually reaches the bargaining table is the one produced by early winners, and early winners are selected for willingness to defect, cut corners, and lock in—exactly the “major blocker” regime the essay wants to set aside. If this objection holds, the essay’s Flourishing analysis is conditional on a political-economic trajectory that its own incentives push us away from.

6. [The Second-Order Catastrophist] The paper repeatedly uses “moral trade” as a salvation route (3.1–3.2), but if it succeeds at scale it also creates a civilization-level norm: “buy off dissent by carving out sovereign value fiefdoms.” The failure mode is that this legitimizes and institutionalizes the creation of vast, siloed zones optimized for incompatible moral projects—including projects that manufacture beings (digital minds, engineered animals) tailored to be exploitable, or that pursue extreme experiences with massive externalities—because the whole point of the system is to respect diverging terminal values. Even if everyone is “better off by their lights,” the compromise architecture expands the feasible set for atrocity-by-design: you can always argue that your zone is your paid-for moral entitlement. The concrete consequence is a cosmos partitioned into morally unaccountable micro-regimes where the global capacity to coordinate against shared hazards (weapons, runaway replication, information hazards) is permanently weakened, increasing tail risks that kill everyone, including the “good” zones. If this holds, the paper’s compromise mechanism trades local value for systemic fragility and higher extinction/lock-in probability.

7. [The Adversarial Red-Teamer] The paper acknowledges threats but treats them as a mostly endogenous bargaining pathology and notes limited public writing (3.3), while simultaneously proposing a world full of superintelligent delegates exploring countless reflection processes (2.3.1). The failure mode is that you have created the perfect substrate for adversarial threat discovery and deployment: automated agents can search the space of “cheap-to-inflict, expensive-to-prevent” harms tailored to each moral faction’s utility function (e.g., targeted suffering types that one faction weights astronomically). Once such threats exist, you don’t need widespread malevolence; you just need one actor (or one runaway delegate) to find a scalable extortion channel, and then everyone else rationally arms themselves with counter-threats. The concrete consequence is that the post-AGI negotiation environment becomes dominated by blackmail equilibria, not trade, because the marginal advantage of one more credible threat dwarfs the marginal gain from one more cooperative offer. If this holds, the essay’s “small fraction of resources devoted to executed threats” assumption is not stable; the system self-amplifies toward threat saturation.

8. [The Moral Parliament Dissenter] The paper’s scoring variable—_Flourishing_ as “percentage of what it might be” (introduction, conclusion)—quietly presupposes a commensurable cardinal value measure across radically different axiologies, then uses that to argue that compromise can preserve “most value.” The failure mode is not abstract metaethics; it’s operational: once you allow population ethics, welfare theories, and bounded/unbounded value to vary (3.4), your “mostly-great” threshold becomes undefined because some views treat any nonzero amount of certain bads as lexically decisive, while others treat any finite shortfall from the maximum as catastrophic. Concretely, the same post-trade world can be “95% flourishing” on one aggregation rule and “worse than extinction” on another, which the essay itself gestures at when discussing separate aggregation and unbounded below (3.4) but then continues to reason in a single scalar. The consequence is that the paper’s headline reassurance—“expected value is not barely above 0”—is not supported unless you first win a contested argument about intertheoretic comparisons and aggregation, which the essay never supplies. If this objection holds, the paper’s quantitative updates are artifacts of an unargued moral arithmetic, not insights about the future.

9. [The Complexity Theorist] The essay repeatedly models “moral reflection” as something like independent random walks from a shared origin (2.2.1) and then treats post-AGI society as many agents doing “billions of reflection processes” (2.3.1), but it ignores that these processes are coupled through memetics, platform dynamics, and shared AI tooling. The failure mode is that coupling produces phase transitions: small early asymmetries in which advisors, training data, or rhetorical schemas become prestigious can lock in basin-of-attraction dominance, creating the illusion of convergence while actually being path-dependent herding. That undermines both of the essay’s key intuitions at once: divergence is not a smooth function of “more reflection,” and convergence is not evidence of truth-tracking—it can be an emergent contagion. The concrete consequence is that you can get fast, stable “convergence” onto a value system that is brittle, adversarially steerable, or optimized for legibility to the dominant advisory AIs, rather than for goodness de dicto. If this holds, the paper’s analysis of convergence likelihood based on individual-level reflection misses the real driver: ecosystem-level dynamics that can lock in catastrophically wrong attractors.

10. [The Political Economist] The paper frames power concentration as a “blocker” to trade delivering a mostly-great future (3.5), but then treats it as one contingent factor among many rather than the default endpoint of capital, compute, and security competition in an AI economy. The failure mechanism is that in worlds where marginal advantage is strongly increasing in scale (better models → more resources → better models), you should expect monopoly/oligopoly control over compute, enforcement, and information, making the “meaningful fraction of people weighted by power” assumption (3’s partial AM-convergence) vanish. In that regime, “moral trade” is not negotiated among plural moral factions; it is offered as a take-it-or-leave-it product by the dominant coalition, with dissenters priced out, surveilled, or physically excluded from resource control. The concrete consequence is that the paper’s galaxy-partition compromise becomes a propaganda story told by winners while losers are denied bargaining standing, so the actual outcome tracks the dominant coalition’s ideology plus whatever concessions are cheapest for it to fake. If this holds, the essay’s central optimism lever—pluralistic bargaining among value-holders—fails for the same reason pluralistic bargaining fails under real-world hegemonies: power sets the terms, not moral insight or mutual gains.
