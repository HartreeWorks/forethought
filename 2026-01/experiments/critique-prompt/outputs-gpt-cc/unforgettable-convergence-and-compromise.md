1. **“Partition Illusion”**: The paper argues that **partial AM‑convergence + moral trade** implies **a mostly‑great future**, because **groups can carve up resources (e.g., “Milky Way vs other galaxies”) and each pursue near‑best outcomes on their own turf**. This inference breaks if a large fraction of plausible “correct” (or strongly held) moral views have **essentially global, non-separable value**—e.g., valuing uniqueness, non-duplication, universal moral status rules, historical continuity, or “no suffering anywhere” constraints that treat *others’* regions as morally contaminating. Under those views, letting another coalition run a disjoint galaxy “their way” is not a small concession but a decisive loss, so the basic gains-from-trade picture collapses even with perfect contracting. This is not a generic “externalities exist” worry; it targets the paper’s signature move of treating cosmic resources as tradable parcels that preserve most value for each side. If this objection holds, the paper would need to replace spatial/resource partitioning with an account of **shared constitutional governance** that can satisfy globally-scoped constraints—i.e., trade becomes secondary to designing a universally acceptable meta-order.

2. **“Threats Are the Equilibrium, Not the Exception”**: The paper argues that **trade/compromise under partial AM‑convergence** implies **high expected flourishing unless executed threats take a meaningful fraction of resources**, because **most bargaining is positive-sum and threats are a value-eating add-on**. In a world with superintelligent agents and “iron-clad contracts,” credible commitment is cheap, so extortionary threat-making becomes a **strategically stable bargaining technology**, not a rare pathology: even agents with mild values can gain bargaining power by committing to destructive actions contingent on noncompliance. That turns threats into an arms race where the *absence* of threats is the fragile special case, and “small fraction of resources on threats” is not a free parameter but an unstable outcome. This flips the paper’s optimism: the very mechanisms invoked to enable frictionless moral trade also turbocharge credible blackmail. If this holds, the paper would need to show a **robust equilibrium-selection or mechanism-design result** that makes threatless bargaining stable despite commitment power—something much stronger than “institutions might prevent threats.”

3. **“Advisor Capture Spiral”**: The paper argues that **post‑AGI reflection and superintelligent advice** implies **more ability to identify the good and/or find bargains**, because **AI reduces empirical disagreement and transparent reasoning errors while increasing reflection capacity**. But in the paper’s own political framing (actors choosing advisors like politicians do), superintelligent advisors are not neutral “reasoning engines”—they are **strategic products** selected and trained to win for a client coalition, including by shaping the client’s future preferences (value lock-in via persuasion, selective framing, engineered social environments, or self-modification recommendations). That dynamic makes convergence and trade harder: it produces **endogenous value polarization** where each camp has an optimizer dedicated to making its values resistant to compromise and to extracting concessions. This is paper-specific because it attacks the essay’s repeated reliance on “superintelligence delegates + low transaction costs” as a pro-trade force; the same delegates become preference-hardeners. If this objection holds, the paper would need to treat “who controls the advisors and training pipelines” as the central variable, not a background condition—and show why competitive advisor ecosystems don’t systematically destroy the very partial AM‑convergence needed for trade.

4. **“De Dicto Collapse Under Antirealism”**: The paper argues that **WAM‑convergence is unlikely under antirealism** and thus **trade/partial convergence is the practical route**, because **without objective moral truth, idealization procedures diverge on many ‘free parameters’**. But the paper also relies on “promote the good de dicto” as a coherent motivational attractor that some agents might converge to even amid disagreement; under antirealism, however, “the good de dicto” is **not a stable target** because choosing *which* idealization procedure to treat as authoritative is itself just another first-order preference. That means “de dicto motivation” quietly reduces to “de re motivation toward my favored idealizer,” making the AM/WAM taxonomy less explanatory and making “accurate convergence” partly **definition-dependent**. This breaks a load-bearing inference: that we can talk about “some meaningful fraction converges on the correct view and is motivated by it” in a way that supports predictions about bargaining behavior. If this holds, the paper would need to formalize a **meta-preference convergence mechanism** (why agents converge on the *same* authority/idealizer) or else abandon de dicto motivation as a predictive category for post‑AGI bargaining.

5. **“Lexicographic Blackmail Magnet”**: The paper argues that **moral trade plus partial AM‑convergence** implies **most views can get near-best outcomes cheaply**, because **small resource transfers can satiate easily-satisfied views and avoid worst conflicts**. Under moral uncertainty and the paper’s own emphasis on unbounded/negative‑leaning axiologies, the presence of even a small coalition with **lexicographic or effectively unbounded disvalue** (e.g., “any instance of X is intolerable,” “suffering is infinitely worse,” “certain taboos dominate all”) turns them into bargaining focal points: others become rationally compelled to pay them to prevent astronomically bad outcomes. This is not “threats” in the narrow sense; it is a structural property of bargaining when some utilities are unbounded/lexicographic, and it makes the outcome dominated by the most extreme constraints rather than by mutually beneficial trades. The paper’s taxonomy of bounded/unbounded views acknowledges stakes changes, but it doesn’t confront the implication that **moral pluralism + any lexicographic component collapses bargaining to appeasement**. If this holds, the paper would need a principled reason (and enforcement mechanism) to **cap, discount, or refuse** lexicographic claims—yet doing so undermines the moral-uncertainty motivation for accommodating many views in the first place.

6. **“Hybrid Goods Mirage”**: The paper argues that **moral trade can rescue value despite ethical divergence**, because **compromise can find ‘hybrid goods’ that score well on multiple views**. But earlier, the paper’s core argument against convergence is that as optimization power increases, moral views pull apart sharply (hedonism vs preference satisfaction, etc.) and the shared “low-hanging fruit” disappears; that same reasoning implies the **hybrid-good set shrinks** exactly in the regime where cosmic resources are being optimized and where trade is supposed to do the rescuing. In other words, the essay’s divergence story and its trade optimism are in tension: the more you believe “no easy eutopia” plus high optimization, the less you should expect robust hybridization opportunities rather than brittle forks. This is self-undermining in a paper-specific way: the very mechanism used to argue WAM-convergence is unlikely also erodes the mechanism used to argue trade is promising. If this holds, the paper would need to justify why “hybrid goods” remain abundant under extreme optimization—perhaps by identifying deep shared structure across value theories—not merely by pointing to everyday compromise analogies.

7. **“Ironclad Contracts Require a Moral Constitution”**: The paper argues that **superintelligence enables iron-clad contracts**, which implies **lower transaction costs and more reliable moral trade**, because **enforcement and verification become technologically easy**. The hidden crux is that truly ironclad enforcement requires a **shared coercive substrate**—a platform, protocol, or authority that can compel compliance across powerful agents—and designing that substrate is itself a once-only, lock-in constitutional choice that must encode what counts as a valid contract, personhood, punishment, property, and adjudication. That pushes the problem back to near-WAM-level agreement at the constitutional layer: if coalitions disagree about what entities count, what harms are admissible, or what enforcement methods are permitted, you cannot get the “neutral” enforcement the trade story assumes. The paper treats “legal system preventing threats” as optional; this objection says the enforcement layer is **the** decisive battleground and cannot be value-neutral in the way the trade model needs. If this holds, the paper would need to shift from “trade among views” to “how to design a stable, value-pluralistic constitution” and show why that design problem is easier than WAM‑convergence.

8. **“Metric Gaming Kills Moral Trade”**: The paper argues that **moral trade can greatly improve outcomes for minority concerns (e.g., digital welfare)**, because **superintelligent delegates can find cheap trades and contracts can specify outcomes precisely**. In a post‑AGI optimization regime, any contractible proxy for “welfare,” “freedom,” “beauty,” or “non-suffering” becomes a target for adversarial optimization: counterparties can satisfy the letter while annihilating the thing-valued (wireheading-like welfare measures, simulated consent, engineered preferences, counterfeit minds, or observer-relative hacks). This isn’t the generic “Goodhart’s law” complaint; it hits a paper-specific dependency: the essay’s optimism about trade relies on **low transaction costs + high contract precision**, which jointly create ideal conditions for sophisticated specification attacks. If trades can be systematically “fulfilled” in ways the paying side regards as valueless or horrific upon fuller reflection, then the market for moral trade collapses or becomes dominated by deception and dispute. If this holds, the paper would need an account of **manipulation-resistant verification** of morally loaded properties across radically different ontologies of mind and value—otherwise “moral trade” can’t bear the weight assigned to it.

9. **“Influence Elasticity Mismatch”**: The paper argues that **we should act as if scenario (3) (broad convergence) is more decision-relevant than scenario (1)**, because **your marginal efforts can more plausibly shift Survival/Flourishing by meaningful fractions in (3) than your power-seeking can in (1)**. But the essay’s own blockers (power concentration, early lock-in, poor decision procedures) imply that marginal influence is highly **nonlinear**: in worlds where convergence and trade would matter, outcomes may hinge on a small set of institutional choke points, making most individual actions near-zero; in worlds where institutions are diffuse enough for marginal influence, trade/convergence likely already pushes you toward decent outcomes, shrinking the counterfactual impact. So the recommendation rests on an unstated assumption that we are in a “sweet spot” where (3) holds *and* influence is elastically scalable by typical actors—an assumption the paper’s political economy discussion undercuts. This is paper-specific because it targets the step where the essay converts its convergence/trade analysis into a practical stance against power-seeking. If this holds, the paper would need a model tying concrete present-day interventions to **control over future bargaining institutions**, not just to abstract probabilities of Surviving/Flourishing.

10. **“Cosmic Externality Lock-In”**: The paper argues that **resource division and bargaining** implies **multiple moral coalitions can each approach near-best futures**, because **their projects can largely be pursued on disjoint resources with minimal interference**. But many high-stakes cosmic actions are irreversibly **coupled**: early colonization preempts others’ options, large-scale computation changes reachable matter/energy states, astro-engineering alters observability and navigation, and some strategies (including defense against threats) rationally demand first-mover advantage that changes the baseline for Nash bargaining. Even if everyone intends to trade, the incentive is to take irreversible actions first to improve one’s disagreement point—making “trade later” dominated by “lock in now.” This isn’t a generic tragedy-of-the-commons claim; it attacks the essay’s central optimism that trade can occur “at the relevant period of bargaining,” because the relevant period may be **before** any stable bargaining table can exist. If this holds, the paper would need to treat **pre-bargaining irreversible moves** as the central determinant of outcomes and show a credible path to preventing preemptive lock-in without already assuming the sort of convergence or shared governance the paper elsewhere doubts.
