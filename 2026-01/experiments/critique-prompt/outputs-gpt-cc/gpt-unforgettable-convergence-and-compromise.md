1. **"The Fitness-Gradient Smuggle"**: Your central optimism move—“narrow targets can still be hit because we hone in, like flight or wings”—attacks your own setup once you take seriously your meta-ethical discussion. Powered flight and biological wings were found because there is an externally-imposed, relentlessly optimizing gradient (aerodynamics + selection for fitness) that rewards incremental steps and punishes regress; the “target” is coupled to survival. But your paper later argues that for the good (especially under antirealism, and even under realism with weak motivation) there is no analogous, widely-shared gradient pulling diverse agents uphill toward the same optimum. Step-by-step: remove a shared gradient → “honing” is no longer a convergent process but a proliferation process → narrow-target pessimism returns exactly as in *No Easy Eutopia*. If this objection holds, you must either (i) exhibit a concrete, agent-independent optimization pressure that tracks “mostly-great futures” (not just instrumental goods), or (ii) drop the flight analogy and re-derive optimism without importing an external fitness gradient.

2. **"Correct-View Double Bookkeeping"**: The paper’s evaluation machinery repeatedly relies on “the correct moral view” (e.g., “value of the world on the correct moral view after trade,” and the bounded/unbounded taxonomy), while your meta-ethics section treats antirealism/subjectivism as a live possibility that undercuts any privileged correctness notion. The key inference being attacked is: “Even under antirealism, we can still assess whether trade/convergence yields a mostly-great future.” Mechanism: if antirealism is true, then “correct view” collapses into agent-relative idealization outputs; but your later arguments require a single yardstick to say threats “eat most value,” to compare scenarios (1) vs (3), and to assign numbers like 5–10% Flourishing in a unified sense. If this objection holds, you need to rebuild the whole analysis in explicitly *non-single-metric* terms (e.g., a specified bargaining/parliament framework over moral uncertainty) or else explicitly conditionalize every “mostly-great” claim on realism (and accept that your optimism may vanish under the live antirealist branch you emphasize).

3. **"Partition-ability as a Hidden Crux"**: The trade-and-compromise optimism depends on an unstated premise that cosmic resources can be cleanly partitioned into largely independent domains (“you get other galaxies; we get the Milky Way”) without major cross-domain externalities. The inference being attacked is: “Moral trade can approximate near-best futures for multiple views via splitting or hybridizing resource use.” Step-by-step: advanced agents’ projects plausibly share deep physical couplings (computational substrate competition, gravitational/astroengineering side effects, information hazards, light-cone interference, and security externalities) → projects are no longer separable → every “partition” is a security and externality negotiation → bargaining reverts to a single coupled game where the default is strategic dominance, not mutual satisfaction. If this objection holds, you must explicitly model and solve the coupled-externalities case (including enforcement and safety constraints), or else restrict your optimism claims to an explicit regime where externalities are provably negligible and enforceable boundaries exist.

4. **"The Self-Modification Bargaining Arms Race"**: Your optimism about trade implicitly assumes bargainers arrive with more-or-less stable preferences and that “iron-clad contracts” just reduce transaction costs, but in the post-AGI world you describe, agents can self-modify to become better bargainers. The inference being attacked is: “With enough delegation and enforceable contracts, gains from moral trade will be widely realized.” Mechanism: if bargaining outcomes depend on threat credibility and disagreement points, then agents get leverage by (i) self-modifying into extreme, non-compromising utility functions, (ii) burning bridges to make refusal costly, and (iii) adopting lexicographic/linear-in-resources values you already flag as worst for compromise—turning “more rational contracting” into “more credible brinkmanship.” If this objection holds, you need to build the trade story around incentive-compatible anti-commitment norms or institutions (e.g., enforceable bans on preference self-mod for leverage, or bargaining solutions that penalize manufactured disagreement points), otherwise the very capabilities you invoke to enable trade select against compromise.

5. **"Threat Research as a Threat Multiplier"**: You argue threats can destroy most value and should be a major priority, but you also note that even learning about threats can increase their incidence; the paper nonetheless publicly supplies the conceptual template (“credibly commit to harm what the other values to extract concessions”). The inference being attacked is: “Raising salience of threat risk helps society prevent threats net-positive.” Step-by-step: publishing threat logic increases the population of actors who can recognize and operationalize extortion opportunities → early movers gain by deploying threats before counter-institutions exist → the baseline shifts from cooperative trade to preemptive deterrence and retaliation equilibria → the expected threat fraction rises precisely because your intervention succeeded at memetic spread. If this objection holds, you must treat the essay itself as an intervention requiring infohazard-aware design: either move key threat content behind controlled channels, or pair it with concrete, enforceable countermeasures (institutional, cryptographic, and normative) strong enough that dissemination doesn’t worsen the equilibrium.

6. **"The ‘Long Views Win’ Reversal"**: Your asymmetric-growth section floats a selection story in which patient, non-discounting values accumulate resources over time, but your later trade analysis identifies precisely those non-discounting, linear-in-resources views as the regime where compromise becomes least effective and threats become most dangerous. The inference being attacked is: “Selection effects toward patience are a reason for optimism about altruistic dominance or convergence.” Mechanism: if patience selects for linear, uncompromising utilities (including non-altruistic collector/positional goals you mention), then over time the negotiating population becomes *more* dominated by the very value types that (i) have low resource-compatibility, and (ii) can rationally justify extreme coercion because marginal resources never stop mattering. Under those plausible conditions, the argument implies the opposite of your intended conclusion: longer time horizons make the compromise path less, not more, likely to yield mostly-great outcomes. If this objection holds, you must either show why patience specifically selects for *cooperative* value structures (not merely non-discounting ones), or abandon asymmetric growth as an optimism lever and treat it as a driver toward your hardest trade/threat cases.

7. **"Partial AM-Convergence is Not the Right Quantity"**: You repeatedly reason in terms of fractions of people who AM-converge (e.g., “not less than one in a million”), but in the post-AGI setting you describe, what matters is not headcount but control of scalable optimization—i.e., whether a tiny cluster can capture decisive power via capability feedback loops. The inference being attacked is: “If a non-tiny minority aims at the good, trade can secure a mostly-great future.” Step-by-step: AGI-era power tends to be superlinear in early advantage (compute, automation, coordination, security) → a small coalition can become the effective singleton or near-singleton regardless of its initial population fraction → bargaining becomes irrelevant because the dominant coalition’s disagreement point is “we take all.” If this objection holds, you must replace “meaningful fraction” talk with an explicit model of power scaling and capture (including security and takeoff dynamics), and show that the window for trade exists *before* decisive advantage collapses the bargaining set.

8. **"The Scenario-3 Policy Boomerang"**: In section 5 you recommend acting more as if scenario (3) holds because the best actions then have higher impact than personal power-seeking in scenario (1), but your own earlier analysis implies that many “scenario (3) actions” (building bargaining infrastructure, making moral trade salient, legitimizing cosmic negotiation) increase the surface area for threats and extortion if scenario (1) or even weak-(3) is true. The inference being attacked is: “Focusing on (3) is robustly higher-EV because it targets bigger upside.” Mechanism: institutions that enable credible commitment and low transaction costs are dual-use: they also enable credible threats, rapid enforcement of extortion, and fine-grained exploitation of minority values—exactly the failure mode you highlight as able to erase most value under many axiologies. If this objection holds, you need a decision rule that is *strategy-robust across scenarios* (e.g., prioritize measures that reduce threat capacity even if they slow trade), otherwise your practical takeaway reverses: the “cooperation-enabling” agenda can be net-negative under the very uncertainty you foreground.

9. **"Cardinal-Value Comparability as the Unstated Engine"**: Your trade story quietly assumes that different moral views can be represented in a way that supports meaningful bargaining—i.e., that there is a shared notion of “resources,” marginal rates of substitution, and (often) something like cardinal comparability for negotiating splits and hybrid goods. The inference being attacked is: “Moral trade can be systematically positive-sum at cosmic scale.” Step-by-step: many of your own example disagreements are over lexicographic or sacred values (worship, identity, deontic constraints, rights, separate aggregation of bads/goods) where no amount of compensation is acceptable; in those cases there is no stable ‘price’ at which the view trades away the contested action, and bargaining reduces to coercion, not exchange. If this objection holds, you must explicitly restrict the scope of the trade optimism to a class of utility representations where compensation and aggregation are well-defined, and separately analyze (not handwave) the lexicographic/sacred-value cases—which your own taxonomy suggests may be common and structurally hostile to compromise.

10. **"The ‘Prevent Threats’ Governance Contradiction"**: You treat “preventing value-destroying threats” as a dominant priority across moral uncertainty, but your own argument that people won’t defer to the good de dicto (and will pick advisors aligned with their ideology) implies that any anti-threat regime powerful enough to work must be *value-contentful* and will be seen as ideological domination by many parties. The inference being attacked is: “A legal/institutional system that reliably prevents threats can be mutually agreeable and stable (or at least implementable) in the pluralistic future you describe.” Mechanism: threat-prevention requires policing credible commitments, punishment, and certain kinds of harm—i.e., it must decide which commitments are illegitimate and which harms count—so it effectively encodes a contested morality; then factions rationally view it as asymmetric disarmament and either refuse to join, route around it with private enforcement, or preempt it by capturing the institution first. If this objection holds, you need to redesign the proposal around *minimal*, non-morality-laden security constraints that can be endorsed from many value systems (or else admit that threat prevention collapses back into the “who has power at lock-in” problem, undermining the trade-based optimism rather than solving it).
