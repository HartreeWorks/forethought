1. **"The ‘narrow target’ premise is asserted more than demonstrated"**  
The paper’s downstream pessimism/optimism hinges on “no easy eutopia”: that most attainable futures lose most value unless one hits a small target. But “value” is left sufficiently underspecified (across population ethics, welfare theory, aggregation, lexicalities, etc.) that it’s unclear the target is actually narrow rather than “thick” across many plausible axiologies. Many moral theories are coarse-grained: they rank huge regions of outcome-space as similarly good once basic constraints (rights, suffering limits, autonomy, meaningful agency) are met. If so, convergence or trade would not need to be extremely precise to capture “most achievable value.” Without a more formal argument for target narrowness under a wide moral-uncertainty portfolio, the paper may be building on an unstable foundation.

2. **"Moral reflection isn’t a random walk; it’s shaped by shared constraints"**  
A key intuition pump is that further reflection causes divergence like a random walk from a common origin. But human moral learning is not unconstrained drift: it is disciplined by shared empirical facts, coordination pressures, cognitive architecture, and repeated bargaining equilibria. Even under antirealism, reflection can converge because agents face similar strategic problems (credible commitment, bargaining, legitimacy, stability) that select for similar norms. The paper acknowledges coordination pressures today but treats them mainly as “conformity” rather than as evidence of deep convergence mechanisms. If convergence is more like optimization under shared constraints than a random walk, the paper may underestimate WAM-convergence (or at least underestimate convergence on a workable moral constitution).

3. **"The realism → ‘alien morality’ inference is weak"**  
The argument that moral realism implies a correct morality that will strike most agents as “weird and alien,” hence non-motivating, is not well supported. Many realist pictures (naturalist realism, Cornell realism, constructivist-leaning realism) predict substantial continuity with evolved social preferences because moral facts are partly about flourishing, cooperation, and reasons grounded in agency. Even if the full truth is revisionary, it may be only locally revisionary (e.g., more impartiality, more scope sensitivity) rather than radically alien. The paper treats “alienness” as a default expectation, but that’s a controversial sociological claim about what the moral truth would be like. If realism instead predicts relatively *nearby* truths, WAM-convergence becomes more plausible than the paper suggests.

4. **"Motivational psychology is modeled too simply (de dicto motivation may be instrumentally selected)"**  
The essay often treats “caring about the good de dicto” as rare and psychologically unnatural. But in advanced societies, agents and institutions may adopt de dicto morality as an *instrument* for trust, legitimacy, and stable coalition-building—especially when power is contestable and reputational systems are strong. Even self-interested actors may commit to impartial procedures because it reduces conflict and increases bargaining surplus. Over time, culturally evolved norms can internalize those commitments (the same way honesty norms often become genuine rather than purely strategic). If de dicto moral motivation can be selected for institutionally (rather than arising from pure philosophical reflection), the paper may underestimate its prevalence among power-holders.

5. **"Moral trade assumes separability and divisibility that future stakes may not allow"**  
The trade optimism often relies on splitting the cosmos (you get galaxies, I get galaxies) or finding “hybrid goods.” But many core moral disputes are non-separable: they concern universal constraints (e.g., “no suffering anywhere,” “no rights-violations anywhere,” “no creation of certain kinds of minds anywhere”), not local resource shares. For agents with deontic or negative-leaning commitments, allowing *any* prohibited practice in someone else’s region is still unacceptable, so there is no surplus to trade. Even for consequentialists, externalities (info hazards, security risks, runaway replication, value drift) can couple domains so strongly that “partitioning” doesn’t preserve what each party values. If the important disagreements are precisely the ones that *aren’t* tradable, the paper’s compromise route to “mostly-great” futures shrinks sharply.

6. **"The threat/extortion problem likely dominates, undermining the trade path"**  
The paper notes threats could eat most value, but arguably understates how structurally pervasive they are once agents can cheaply create bad states as bargaining chips. In high-powered settings, credible commitment technologies can make extortion stable: “pay me or I instantiate X trillion tortured minds” is hard to deter if deterrence itself requires committing to costly retaliation. This becomes even worse under moral pluralism because some parties may *value* making other parties worse off (spite, status, ideological victory), collapsing gains-from-trade assumptions. If threats are cheap relative to defenses, then the equilibrium may be closer to hostage-taking than to Pareto-improving bargaining. In that case, “partial AM + trade” is not a reliable rescue from no-easy-eutopia; it’s a recipe for value destruction.

7. **"Power and lock-in are treated as ‘blockers’ but may be the base case"**  
The essay cordons off extinction, lock-in, and concentration of power as blockers, then reasons “absent blockers.” But many plausible AGI transition stories make these “blockers” the modal trajectory rather than exceptional cases: rapid capability gains, first-mover advantages, security dilemmas, and winner-take-most dynamics. If early decisive actors can entrench governance, then later moral reflection and trade have little causal influence. The paper’s optimism depends on a relatively extended, pluralistic, high-trust bargaining period—yet that period is precisely what many alignment and geopolitical models predict we won’t get. Treating these as add-on caveats risks misweighting the scenario space.

8. **"The feasibility of ‘iron-clad contracts’ and low transaction costs is overstated"**  
Even with superintelligence, contracting across value systems is not just a technical enforcement problem; it’s a specification and interpretation problem. Parties will disagree about what counts as compliance (e.g., what qualifies as “suffering,” “personhood,” “coercion,” “authentic preference,” “identity continuity”), and adversarial optimization will exploit ambiguity. Verification may be computationally and epistemically hard: you might not be able to audit distant regions, detect deceptive simulations, or validate that “promised welfare” is real rather than a fake metric. Strong contracts also introduce new vulnerabilities (backdoors, formalization errors, exploitably incomplete specifications). If enforceability and verifiability are limited, the clean Coasean picture of moral trade becomes far less credible.

9. **"The paper relies on contentious assumptions about value ‘linearity’ and diminishing returns"**  
A lot of the trade/convergence discussion is organized around whether correct preferences are linear in resources, bounded, negative-leaning, separably aggregated, etc. But we have little reason to expect the relevant utility structure to be stable under self-modification, digital life, or population scaling; the shape could itself be an object of strategic manipulation. Agents may adopt utility functions that are bargaining-advantageous (e.g., more “linear” or more “lexical”) because it improves their threat points, not because it reflects deep values. Moreover, even today, revealed “diminishing returns” are confounded by positional competition, identity goods, and status—features likely to persist or intensify at cosmic scale. If the utility-shape assumptions don’t hold, many of the paper’s comparative statics about when trade yields near-best outcomes stop tracking reality.

10. **"The conclusion about prioritizing ‘flourishing’ over ‘surviving’ may be a decision-theoretic misstep"**  
The essay ends by arguing that the ceiling on flourishing dominates survival risk in scale, and suggests shifting emphasis accordingly. But when there is deep uncertainty over value theory, bargaining equilibria, and lock-in dynamics, preserving optionality (i.e., survival plus flexibility) can be instrumentally dominant. Extinction is uniquely irreversible; many “flourishing gaps” might be addressable later if civilization survives with decent epistemics and governance. Also, interventions that improve flourishing prospects (via pluralism/trade) could increase extinction or lock-in risks by intensifying multipolar competition—so the objectives are not cleanly separable. Without a more explicit model of interdependence between survival and flourishing interventions under uncertainty, the portfolio recommendation is not well supported by the preceding analysis.
