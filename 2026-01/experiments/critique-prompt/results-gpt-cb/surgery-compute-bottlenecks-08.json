  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key load-bearing move in the post: treating the effective substitutability/complementarity (\u03c1) as roughly stable so that early-stage dynamics are similar across \u22120.2<\u03c1<0 and compute bottlenecks bite only later. If \u03c1 endogenously becomes more negative right when AI labor becomes abundant, that directly undermines the main conclusion, so centrality is high. However, the argument for an endogenous shift toward compute-intensive methods is mostly asserted rather than demonstrated, and it\u2019s not obvious it goes the stated direction: if cognitive labor becomes cheap relative to compute, actors might also shift toward more labor-intensive, compute-sparing methods (the opposite comparative statics), or at least the net effect is ambiguous. Still, it\u2019s a real possibility and not fully \u201cpriced in\u201d by the original post\u2019s discussion, so it moderately weakens the claim. Clarity is good and it stays on one issue with minimal fluff.",
