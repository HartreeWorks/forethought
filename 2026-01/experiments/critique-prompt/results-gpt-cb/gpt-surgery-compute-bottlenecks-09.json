  "reasoning": "The critique targets Counterargument 7 (\u201cstrongest link/choose best route\u201d), which is a supporting move rather than a load-bearing premise for the overall conclusion (the post has many other counters like experiment efficiency, long-run reconfiguration, and skepticism about extrapolating CES). So centrality is modest. On the attacked node itself, it raises a substantive and relevant mechanism: competitive selection for apparently-low-compute methods may externalize costs into later verification/debugging/alignment compute, meaning the bottleneck is shifted rather than removed. This does weaken the \u2018just pick the best-\u03c1 route\u2019 optimism, but it doesn\u2019t decisively refute it (it depends on empirical magnitude of downstream costs, and the position could respond by pricing validation into the route\u2019s effective \u03c1 or by noting some routes may remain robust). The points are mostly correct/plausible (selection effects, hidden costs, verification burdens) though speculative and not evidenced. It is clear, focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
