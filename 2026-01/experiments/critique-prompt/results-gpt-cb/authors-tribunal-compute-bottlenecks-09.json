That point is supportive but not strictly necessary for the overall conclusion (which also rests on arguments about long-run substitutability, experiment efficiency, extrapolation issues, etc.), so centrality is moderate. The critique\u2019s main move\u2014arguing that purportedly distinct routes may share common compute-intensive prerequisites (frontier models, large-scale evals, tuning, synthetic data generation, red-teaming), so route-shopping doesn\u2019t escape a fixed compute budget\u2014is a real and relevant challenge, but it is not a full refutation: it doesn\u2019t establish that *all* meaningful routes are tightly coupled to the same compute bottleneck, nor quantify the degree of correlation or show that modest-compute paths are implausible. Its factual claims are broadly plausible (these activities typically are compute-demanding), though somewhat speculative in universality and magnitude. It is clearly stated, tightly focused, and has little to no filler.",
