  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific illustrative sub-argument (2.3) used to suggest that \u03c1<0 must fail \u201cin principle\u201d because cognition could substitute for compute. That point is not central to the overall anti-bottleneck case (which offers many other independent reasons), so centrality is low-moderate. Within its target, the critique is fairly strong: it correctly notes that \u201cdoing math in heads\u201d is still physical computation and risks double-counting L as if it were compute-free, so it substantially undermines the intended \u2018in principle\u2019 substitution. The critique is mostly correct under physically realistic accounting (total compute/energy constraints), clearly stated, and tightly focused with little extraneous material. Overall impact on the full position is limited but it is a solid local objection.",
  "title": "Cognitive labor still consumes physical compute, so substitution is illusory"
