  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central enabling assumption behind the post\u2019s conclusion (that scaling cognitive labor translates into effective R&D throughput, so compute won\u2019t bind early): it argues that anticipated SIE dynamics induce security/compartmentalization that reintroduces hard bottlenecks and reduces substitutability. If true, this would meaningfully weaken the claim that early-stage acceleration is likely. However, the critique is mostly speculative and sociological, provides no concrete evidence that such clampdowns are an inescapable or dominant effect, and it doesn\u2019t directly engage the post\u2019s object-level arguments about experiment efficiency, extrapolation from smaller runs, or algorithmic efficiency increasing the experiment budget. Several asserted outcomes (e.g., a major supplier breach, field-wide collapse of collaboration) are conjectural and stated too strongly. Still, the mechanism is coherent and clearly expressed, with little extraneous material, and it remains a single, unified objection.",
