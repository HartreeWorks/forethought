It does weaken that specific move by noting it merely asserts the existence of high-substitutability pathways without identifying one in a grounded way, and that many suggested pathways remain compute-intensive; however, this mostly points out incompleteness/speculativeness rather than decisively showing all routes are compute-bottlenecked, and the original post already concedes uncertainty here. The claims made are broadly correct and clearly stated, with minimal fluff, and it stays focused on a single issue. Overall impact on the full position is limited.",
