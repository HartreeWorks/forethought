  "reasoning": "The critique attacks a central modeling move in the position: treating \u201ccognitive labor L\u201d as an input that can scale up while compute K is held fixed, and then drawing ceilings from CES. If L is instantiated by AGI researchers running on the same hardware budget, then increasing L generally requires allocating more inference FLOPs, reducing FLOPs available for experiments; this undermines the clean \u2018increase L holding K fixed\u2019 comparative statics and pressures the CES mapping. This is a substantial objection, but not fully decisive: the position could respond by redefining L as effective cognitive work per unit inference compute (which can rise via smarter models/algorithms), by explicitly modeling compute allocation between inference and training within fixed K, or by arguing that inference for research is small relative to training or that gains come from better experiment design that increases progress per experiment. The critique is mostly correct and clearly stated, though it somewhat overstates that the CES axis is \u201cphysically blocked\u201d rather than \u2018requires a different decomposition of K\u2019. It stays tightly focused with little extraneous material.",
