  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central move in the position: using algorithmic efficiency / \u201ceffective compute\u201d to argue compute bottlenecks won\u2019t bind early in an SIE. If efficiency gains don\u2019t translate into faster capability progress (because the frontier/ambition set expands), that would materially weaken the \u201cearly stages aren\u2019t compute-bottlenecked\u201d conclusion, hence high centrality. However, the critique mostly offers a plausible counter-model rather than demonstrating that the endogeneity effect dominates; it also partially conflates (a) how labs choose to spend compute with (b) how much algorithmic progress exists in principle. If \u201ceffective training compute\u201d is defined against a fixed benchmark capability/task distribution, then frontier-shifting doesn\u2019t block the metric from improving, it just affects realized deployments and what counts as a \u2018frontier step.\u2019 So it raises a real ambiguity/loophole but doesn\u2019t strongly refute the author\u2019s main empirical-forecast claim. It is clear, focused, and contains little filler.",
