  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s \u201cstrongest-link / multiple routes\u201d rebuttal (counterargument #7), arguing that routes are coupled by a shared, compute-heavy validation step, so route diversity doesn\u2019t evade compute bottlenecks. This is relevant but not core to the paper\u2019s overall case (which offers many other reasons to expect higher substitutability / weaker bottlenecks), so centrality is moderate-low. The point substantially weakens that particular argument: even if idea-generation is cheap, discriminating among proposals and establishing frontier generalization plausibly requires large training/eval runs. However it doesn\u2019t fully refute the paper\u2019s broader thesis, and it overstates somewhat (\u201cnearly all routes\u201d) because some progress/selection may be possible via smaller-scale experiments, theory, or transfer/extrapolation\u2014exactly the kind of escape the paper gestures at. The critique is clear, focused, and has little extraneous content.",
