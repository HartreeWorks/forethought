  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key modeling move in the position: treating \u201ccognitive labour\u201d (more AI researchers) as an input that can scale up while holding compute fixed, which underwrites much of the CES-based discussion of bottlenecks and max-speed ceilings. If L is largely instantiated by inference compute, then L and K are not separable inputs; increasing researchers/cognition often draws from the same compute pool as experiments, potentially reversing the intended comparative statics. This is a substantial challenge but not a full refutation because the position can partly re-define L as \u201ceffective cognition per unit compute\u201d (algorithmic efficiency, better priors/extrapolation, improved tooling) or explicitly model compute allocation and still possibly get fast progress; hence moderate strength. The main factual claim\u2014agentic cognition consumes compute\u2014is broadly correct, though overstated insofar as L can increase at fixed K via software efficiency rather than more parallel agents. The critique is concise, precise, and focused with minimal fluff.",
