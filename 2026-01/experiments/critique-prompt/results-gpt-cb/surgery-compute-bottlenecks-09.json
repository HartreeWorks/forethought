  "reasoning": "The critique targets the position\u2019s \u201cstrongest-link/many routes\u201d move (counterargument #7), arguing that many routes still share a compute-intensive selection/evaluation bottleneck. That point is relevant and would weaken that particular rebuttal to compute bottlenecks, but it is not the position\u2019s sole or primary support (the post offers multiple other independent reasons to expect higher substitutability / weaker compute bottlenecks). Hence only moderate centrality. Within its scope, the critique is fairly strong: it correctly notes that route diversity doesn\u2019t automatically imply substitutability if a common compute-gated validation step remains. However, it doesn\u2019t show that all plausible routes are compute-gated to the degree required, nor does it engage with the position\u2019s other replies (e.g., shifting from near-frontier to smaller experiments, increasing experiment efficiency, long-run reconfiguration). Claims are largely plausible and internally coherent, with limited overreach; clarity is high and there\u2019s little fluff. Overall it\u2019s a useful, focused objection but only moderately damaging to the overall argument.",
