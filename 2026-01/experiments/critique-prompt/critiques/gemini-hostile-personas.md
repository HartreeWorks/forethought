> **Persona:** The Game-Theoretic Defector

> **The "Naïve" Assumption:** The authors assume that moral trade and compromise between groups with different values will actually occur in good faith, and that the gains from such trade will be realized rather than captured by defectors. They write as if "iron-clad contracts" enabled by superintelligence will solve trust problems, and that groups controlling resources will actually honor bargains rather than reneging once they've secured advantageous positions.
>
> **The Attack Vector:** Consider the paper's own admission that "non-discounting views" will accumulate resources over time through patient saving and investment. A faction adopting "total utilitarian" rhetoric can credibly commit to patience, attract resources from other patient groups via moral trade agreements, and then—once they control sufficient compute or physical infrastructure—simply defect. The "iron-clad contracts" the authors wave at are enforced by... what exactly? Other superintelligent systems? Those systems are controlled by *someone*, and that someone faces the same defection incentives. The paper admits threats are understudied and that "merely learning about the topic can make it more likely for threats to occur." So the authors are simultaneously acknowledging that threat dynamics are crucial to their trade-based optimism while refusing to analyze them. A coalition that credibly pre-commits to scorched-earth retaliation against defectors gains massive bargaining leverage over groups that care about "hybrid goods" and "resource compatibility." The authors' own framework predicts that groups with unbounded negative preferences (or willingness to simulate them) dominate the equilibrium.
>
> **The "Copy-Paste" Check:** This critique specifically targets the paper's reliance on moral trade between groups with "partial AM-convergence" (Section 3) and their hand-wave toward superintelligence-enabled contracts. Generic critiques about coordination failure don't address the specific mechanism of patient value-accumulators defecting after resource consolidation, which is a direct consequence of the paper's own "long views win" argument in Section 2.3.3.
>
> **The Outcome:** The treaty is signed. Groups agree to partition galaxies according to their stated values. The faction that most credibly committed to "total utilitarian" expansion quietly develops enforcement-immune infrastructure, then announces that the original agreements were made under "empirical uncertainty" that has now been "resolved." They absorb 99% of accessible resources. The authors' "5-10% of maximum value" estimate was wildly optimistic—the actual outcome is whatever the winning defector wanted, which may include turning the light cone into a monument to their founder's ego.

> **Persona:** The Technical Hardliner
>
> **The "Naïve" Assumption:** The authors assume that concepts like "mostly-great future," "accurate ethical convergence," "the good (de dicto)," and "near-best future" are sufficiently well-defined to support quantitative reasoning. They assign probability estimates (5-10% of maximum value) without ever specifying a utility function, a measure over possible futures, or a formal definition of what "mostly-great" means mathematically.
>
> **The Attack Vector:** The paper's core claim is that "Flourishing" has "notably greater scale" than "Surviving." This is meaningless without a specification of the value function V: Futures → ℝ. The authors gesture at "hedonism," "preference satisfaction," "objective list theories"—but these aren't interchangeable. They have different domains, different ordinal structures, and potentially different cardinalities of value. When they say a future achieves "1% vs 10% of maximum value," they're implicitly assuming value is bounded above, commensurable across moral theories, and measurable. None of this is defended. Their "random walk" diagram (Section 2.2.1) is a cartoon, not a model. What is the metric space? What is the step distribution? What is the dimensionality? The claim that "further reflection seems likely to make resulting views diverge more" is not a theorem—it's a vibe. In fact, under many reasonable models of belief updating (e.g., Bayesian convergence to truth given shared evidence), we'd expect *convergence*, not divergence. The authors provide no formal argument for why ethical reflection resembles a random walk rather than gradient descent toward a fixed point.
>
> **The "Copy-Paste" Check:** This critique specifically targets the paper's quantitative claims about "5-10% of maximum value" and the "random walk" model of ethical reflection. A generic complaint about "fuzzy concepts" wouldn't address the specific failure to formalize the value function that underlies all their probability estimates, nor the specific diagram they use to argue against convergence.
>
> **The Outcome:** The paper's conclusions are not even wrong—they're undefined. When the authors say "Flourishing is 5-10%," this statement has no truth conditions. It cannot be tested, updated on, or used to derive action-guiding implications. Future researchers cite this paper as establishing a "5-10%" baseline, building an entire literature on a number that was never grounded in anything. Policy decisions are made on the basis of these vibes-based estimates. The actual value of the future is orthogonal to all of it.

> **Persona:** The Second-Order Catastrophist
>
> **The "Naïve" Assumption:** The authors assume that successfully achieving "partial AM-convergence plus trade" is desirable. They treat the scenario where multiple groups with different values peacefully partition resources as a positive outcome, perhaps the "most likely way in which we reach a mostly-great future."
>
> **The Attack Vector:** Suppose the paper's proposal succeeds exactly as written. Multiple groups with "partial AM-convergence" establish stable trade relationships, partition the accessible universe, and pursue their respective visions of the good. One group believes consciousness requires biological substrates and creates trillion-year civilizations of embodied beings. Another group believes consciousness is substrate-independent and tiles their galaxies with maximally efficient hedonic computers. A third group has converged on a view that values "complexity" and "diversity" and maintains vast ecosystems of competing agents. Here's the catastrophe: *all of these groups are wrong*. The paper explicitly acknowledges this possibility—that even reflective convergence might not reach truth. But the "trade and compromise" framework *locks in* this wrongness permanently. Each group, having secured their cosmic territory, has no incentive to update. The biological-consciousness faction will never learn they were wrong because they'll never run the experiments that would falsify their view. The hedonic-computer faction optimizes for a utility function that may be orthogonal to actual value. The diversity-preserving faction maintains suffering indefinitely because they've defined it as "complexity." The paper's own framework—emphasizing "iron-clad contracts" and stable equilibria—ensures that these errors become permanent features of the universe. A future with a single uncertain agent would at least have the possibility of learning and updating. The paper's preferred future has *crystallized* moral error across cosmological scales.
>
> **The "Copy-Paste" Check:** This critique specifically targets the paper's endorsement of "partial AM-convergence plus trade" (Section 3) as the most promising path to good futures, combined with their acknowledgment that convergence might not reach truth (Section 2.4). Generic concerns about "lock-in" don't address the specific mechanism by which *successful* moral trade creates permanent, distributed, update-resistant moral error.
>
> **The Outcome:** The authors' vision succeeds. Humanity and its successors avoid extinction, avoid concentration of power, establish functioning institutions for moral trade, and peacefully partition the cosmos. Ten billion years later, 40% of the light cone is filled with beings experiencing states their creators *believed* were maximally valuable but which are actually neutral or negative. Another 30% is devoted to "preserving complexity" in ways that perpetuate astronomical suffering. The remaining 30% achieved genuine value by luck. The total outcome is worse than if a single faction had seized control and then, centuries later, discovered and corrected their errors—because the trade-based equilibrium made error-correction impossible. The paper's "5-10%" estimate was optimistic not because convergence failed, but because convergence *succeeded* at locking in the wrong answers.
