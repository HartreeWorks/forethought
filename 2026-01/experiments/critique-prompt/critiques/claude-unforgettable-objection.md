## The key inference

A → B because M: **The paper argues that even if mostly-great futures are a narrow target (A), humanity might still reach one (B), because either (1) widespread moral convergence will aim society at the good, or (2) partial convergence plus trade/compromise will enable different groups to collectively achieve near-best outcomes (M).**

## Candidates considered

1. **The trade mechanism assumes commensurability between moral views that the "narrow target" premise denies** — Hidden crux
2. **If moral realism makes correct views "alien," the same alienness undermines the paper's own normative authority to identify which futures are "mostly-great"** — Self-undermining
3. **The "narrow target" framing is doing double duty: strict enough to establish scale but loose enough to permit convergence/trade solutions** — Hidden crux
4. **Superintelligent reflection accelerates divergence faster than it enables convergence, because it multiplies the dimensionality of moral possibility space** — Reversal
5. **The threat problem isn't a bug in the trade scenario—it's the equilibrium, because credible commitment to threats is cheaper than credible commitment to cooperation at cosmic scales** — Adversarial exploit

## The Unforgettable Objection: "The Commensurability Contradiction"

**One-liner**: The paper needs moral views to be incommensurable enough to make eutopia narrow, but commensurable enough to make trade work—it can't have both.

**The full argument**: The "no easy eutopia" premise requires that different moral views demand *radically different* futures, such that satisfying one view means losing most value on another. But the trade/compromise mechanism (Section 3) requires that views can find "hybrid goods" and mutually beneficial exchanges—which presupposes enough shared structure between views to make cross-view value comparisons meaningful. If views are truly as incommensurable as the narrow-target premise requires, then there's no common metric by which both parties can recognize a trade as mutually beneficial; if they're commensurable enough for trade to work, then the target isn't as narrow as claimed. The paper's optimism about trade is parasitic on a softer version of moral pluralism than its pessimism about convergence assumes.

**Why it's not obvious**: The paper discusses trade and convergence in separate sections, and the examples of trade (hedonists and objective-list theorists creating "blissful and wise" beings) seem intuitive. But these examples work precisely because they assume the views can be jointly satisfied in the same beings—which contradicts the earlier claim that "increasingly optimised" futures for different views "begin to look *very* different."

**Blast radius**: If this objection holds, the entire two-path structure of the paper collapses. Path 1 (convergence) is argued to be unlikely. Path 2 (trade) depends on commensurability. If commensurability fails, there's no remaining mechanism for reaching mostly-great futures, and the paper's qualified optimism (the 5-10% update) is unjustified.

**Author's best reply**: Trade doesn't require full commensurability—it only requires that views have *some* overlapping instrumental goods or that resource-compatibility exists for *some* view-pairs. Even if most view-pairs can't trade, a minority of compatible views might still control enough resources to matter.

**Why it fails**: The paper itself argues (Section 3.2) that linear, non-discounting views are unlikely to be resource-compatible, and these are precisely the views that would dominate in the long run (Section 2.3.3). So the views most likely to matter are the ones least likely to benefit from trade. The reply concedes the point for the cases that matter most.

**Repair options**:
1. **Minimal patch**: Distinguish between "narrow target" (many views lose most value) and "zero overlap" (views share no structure). Argue the target is narrow but not infinitely so—enough overlap exists for meaningful trade, just not enough for easy convergence.
2. **Honest concession**: Acknowledge that trade-based optimism applies mainly to "bounded above" views with overlapping instrumental goods, and that for linear/unbounded views, the situation is much grimmer than the paper's overall tone suggests.
3. **Rebuild**: Abandon the two-path framing. Instead argue that the *type* of moral view that's correct determines whether trade or convergence is the relevant mechanism—and that our uncertainty over moral views should make us invest in *both* institutional infrastructure for trade *and* conditions for convergence, without claiming either is likely to succeed.
