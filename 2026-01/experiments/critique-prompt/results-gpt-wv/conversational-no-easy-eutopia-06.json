  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific but nontrivial step in Section 3.3: the move from \u201cbounded (universal) views\u201d to \u201cpractically linear\u201d via the premise that the universe is (effectively) enormous and already filled with other value-bearing civilizations, making humanity\u2019s marginal impact tiny. If that step fails, one important route to \u2018bounded views are still fussy\u2019 is weakened, but the overall \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 conclusion has several other independent supports (multiplicative fragility in Section 2; fussiness of unbounded linear views; fussiness of bounded difference-making views, especially with separate aggregation), so centrality is moderate rather than high. The critique has moderate strength: it doesn\u2019t show the paper\u2019s inference is wrong given its assumptions, but it does argue those assumptions are highly contingent/uncertain and that under plausible alternative cosmology/astrobiology (or certain moral frameworks) the \u201cin-practice linear\u201d claim may not hold, which would reopen space for bounded concavity to matter. Most claims are broadly correct and relevant; the main slight overreach is that some listed alternatives (e.g., domain-relative/relational ethics) shift the moral view rather than directly undercutting the paper\u2019s conditional argument about universal-value bounded views. It is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",
