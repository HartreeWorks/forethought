  "reasoning": "The critique targets a supporting inference in the paper\u2019s case that unbounded linear views are \u201cfussy\u201d: that separability/linearity implies there is (effectively) a single locally value-efficient configuration that must be replicated, making the target very narrow. This is a meaningful piece of the linear-view argument but not the whole position (the paper also argues fussiness via scale requirements and fat-tailed value-efficiency), so centrality is moderate. The objection is fairly strong against that specific inference: additivity/separability does not entail uniqueness or sparsity of near-maximizers, and large equivalence classes/symmetries could make the set of near-optimal uses broad. However, it doesn\u2019t directly engage the paper\u2019s separate fat-tail and \u201cmost resources must be used\u201d claims, so it weakens rather than collapses the linear-view fussiness conclusion. Most claims are correct as logical/possibility points; the main limitation is that it establishes a possibility (many near-optima) rather than showing it is likely under the paper\u2019s assumed distribution. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little to no fluff.",
