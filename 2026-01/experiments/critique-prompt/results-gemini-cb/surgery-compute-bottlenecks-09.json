  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central load-bearing part of the post\u2019s conclusion: that compute bottlenecks likely don\u2019t bind in early SIE stages (so the feedback loop can get going). If we were already near the compute-imposed ceiling, that would significantly undercut the \u201cearly stages\u201d claim and potentially the plausibility of a rapid SIE. However, the critique\u2019s support is thin: (i) it correctly notes that in a CES-style framework the impact of rho depends on the starting L/K regime (so assuming a balanced baseline matters), but (ii) it does not justify that today\u2019s AI R&D is actually on the flat/near-ceiling portion of such a curve, and \u201chigh demand for H100s\u201d is ambiguous evidence (compute scarcity does not by itself show marginal returns to additional cognitive labor are already very low). It also doesn\u2019t engage with the position\u2019s key reply that algorithmic/efficiency gains change the effective experiment budget, which weakens the \u2018fixed K\u2019 premise. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight, but only modestly weakens the position without more argument/evidence.",
