  "reasoning": "The critique identifies a genuine tension: the paper uses moral pluralism rhetorically in Section 2 (many views see catastrophe) but then adopts a vNM cardinal framework in Section 3. However, the paper explicitly acknowledges this limitation \u2014 Section 3.1 states 'Not every moral view can reasonably be represented as ascribing cardinal value to different outcomes' and notes views may violate completeness. The paper treats the Section 2 discussion and Section 3 analysis as complementary but somewhat independent arguments. The Section 2 argument about moral catastrophes doesn't actually require commensurability \u2014 it just notes that on *each* view separately, the world falls far short, which motivates the general fragility intuition without requiring cross-view aggregation. The formal Section 3 argument works within specific view-classes (linear, bounded, etc.) rather than aggregating across incompatible moral traditions. The moral uncertainty discussion in 3.5 does aggregate across views and faces the commensurability concern more directly, but the paper treats this as one consideration among many rather than the core argument. So the critique attacks something real but somewhat peripheral \u2014 the rhetorical bridge between Sections 2 and 3, plus the Section 3.5 aggregation \u2014 rather than the main arguments in either section independently. The critique is partially correct: the pluralism-to-single-scale move is indeed a tension, but calling the conclusion 'an artifact of imposed commensurability' overstates the case since the fragility conclusion follows from analyzing individual plausible views separately, not just from cross-view aggregation. Strength is limited because the paper's authors are clearly aware of and explicitly flag these limitations.",
