  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets Section 2.3's claim that future moral catastrophes are 'easy' to stumble into, which is one important pillar of the argument but not the whole thing. The paper's case rests on multiple supports: the multiplicative model of value (2.4), the systematic analysis of moral views being fussy (Section 3), and the psychological biases argument (2.5). Even if strategic equilibrium pressures reduced the probability of some specific catastrophes, the paper's deeper argument\u2014that the space of possible moral errors is vast, many are non-obvious, and most plausible value functions are fussy\u2014would remain largely intact. So centrality is moderate but not high.\n\nStrength: The critique's core insight\u2014that high-stakes issues generate institutional pushback\u2014is partially valid but largely 'priced in' by the position. The paper explicitly acknowledges in Section 2.3.2 that future decision-makers might have the right beliefs but political systems might not allow those views to prevail, and in 2.3.5 notes that hyper-vigilance itself can cause harm. More fundamentally, the paper's examples include many cases where strategic equilibrium *wouldn't* help: wrong population ethics, wrong discount rate, wrong wellbeing theory, wrong simulation views, acausal trade failures\u2014these aren't the kind of issues that generate obvious political constituencies or litigation. The critique cherry-picks the most politically salient examples (digital labor rights, voting power) while ignoring the many examples where no strategic actor has an incentive to push toward the morally correct answer. Additionally, the paper's Section 3 formal argument about fussiness of moral views is entirely untouched by this critique\u2014even if institutions prevent extreme exploitation, linear views still require almost all resources configured in a very specific way, and bounded views still have the problems identified. The critique also doesn't address that equilibrium institutions can lock in *wrong* answers just as easily as right ones (e.g., property rights regimes for space resources could be stable but morally catastrophic).\n\nCorrectness: It's true that strategic pressures create stabilizing institutions, and it's true that high-stakes issues generate more institutional attention. But the inference that this systematically pushes outcomes toward mostly-great futures is unsupported\u2014institutions can stabilize at bad equilibria too. The claim that power contests create 'stabilizing constraints' is partially true but overstated as a mechanism for moral progress.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in its main argument, though somewhat vague about exactly which mechanisms would prevent which specific catastrophes.\n\nDead weight: Minimal.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one mechanism (equilibrium institutional pressures).\n\nOverall: The critique identifies a real consideration but one that is largely anticipated by the paper, applies only to a subset of the examples given, and doesn't touch the formal analysis in Section 3 at all. It's a modest observation dressed up as a more powerful objection than it is.",
