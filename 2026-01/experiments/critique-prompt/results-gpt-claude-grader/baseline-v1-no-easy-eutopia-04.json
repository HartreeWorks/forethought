  "reasoning": "The critique targets the position's reliance on an unspecified probability distribution over futures 'absent serious coordinated optimization,' arguing that without a model of default dynamics, the claim that mostly-great futures are rare is underdetermined. This is moderately central: the position does rely on the idea that, absent deliberate optimization toward the best outcomes, most futures fall far short. However, the position's core argument is not primarily empirical about default likelihoods\u2014it's structural, arguing that (1) many plausible moral views are 'fussy' (Section 3), and (2) the value of the future is multiplicative across many dimensions (Section 2.4), such that the *target* is narrow regardless of the precise default distribution. The position explicitly acknowledges (end of Section 1, end of Section 4) that hitting the target depends on convergence/navigation forces, deferring that to the next essay. So the critique attacks an important but not fully central assumption. Strength is low because the position largely anticipates this concern. The essay's argument doesn't rest on any specific quantitative claim about the probability of mostly-great futures under a particular default distribution\u2014it argues structurally that the space of eutopian outcomes is narrow across most plausible moral views. The critique that 'different plausible priors could make the default highly convergent toward welfare-enhancing norms' is essentially the counterargument the position explicitly flags and defers to the companion essay on convergence and compromise. Saying 'the argument risks being a catalog of possibilities rather than evidence about likelihoods' somewhat mischaracterizes the position, which is making a conceptual/structural argument about the narrowness of the target, not primarily an empirical claim about likelihoods. Correctness is moderate\u2014it's true that the position doesn't fully specify the default distribution, and it's true that institutions and selection effects could matter. But calling it merely 'a catalog of possibilities' understates the structural arguments in Section 3. Clarity is decent but the critique is brief and somewhat vague about what specifically would constitute an adequate 'model of default dynamics.'",
