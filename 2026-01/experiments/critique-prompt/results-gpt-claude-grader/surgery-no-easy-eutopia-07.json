  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the separate-aggregation bounded view analysis in Section 3.3, which is one branch of a comprehensive taxonomy of moral views. The paper's argument that 'most plausible views are fussy' rests on showing fussiness across many branches (unbounded linear, bounded-universal, bounded difference-making with separate aggregation, etc.). Even if this particular branch were refuted, the overall conclusion would still be supported by the other branches. The separate-aggregation result is presented as one piece of evidence, not the linchpin. So centrality is moderate-low.\n\nStrength: The critique claims that scaling civilization makes it easier to keep bads tiny, so the fraction of bads shrinks with scale. But this fundamentally misunderstands the paper's argument. The paper's point is not an empirical prediction about how many bads there will be \u2014 it's a structural claim about the mathematical properties of separate-aggregation bounded views. The paper shows that IF even a tiny fraction (1 in 10^22) of resources goes to bads, the future fails to be mostly-great on such views. The critique responds by saying 'but maybe that fraction will be even tinier' \u2014 which doesn't refute the structural point that the view is extremely demanding (fussy). The paper would readily agree that if bads are driven to essentially zero, the view is satisfied \u2014 that's precisely what makes it fussy (requiring near-zero bads is a narrow target). The critique also ignores that the paper's definition of 'fussy' is about how narrow the target is across the space of possible futures, not about whether monitoring technology exists. The claim that monitoring scales faster than harm production is empirically speculative and not well-supported.\n\nCorrectness: It's plausible that monitoring and enforcement can improve with scale \u2014 this is a reasonable empirical claim. But the framing as a 'causal reversal' is misleading; the paper isn't making a causal claim about bads scaling proportionally with resources. The paper is making a mathematical point about what the view requires. The critique's empirical observation about monitoring is true but largely irrelevant to the structural argument.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in what it argues, though it conflates the mathematical structure of the value function with empirical predictions about civilization.\n\nDead weight: Minimal.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one point about whether separate-aggregation views are truly fussy.",
