  "reasoning": "Centrality: The VNM framework is important to the paper's argument, particularly in Section 3 where the systematic analysis of 'fussy' vs 'easygoing' views relies on cardinal value functions. However, the paper's overall thesis doesn't rest entirely on this formalism \u2014 Section 2's arguments about moral catastrophes, multiplicative value, and the fragility of eutopia are largely independent of VNM axioms. The paper also explicitly acknowledges (footnote 27) that not all views satisfy completeness, and notes the framework isn't restricted to consequentialism. So the VNM apparatus is central to roughly half the argument (Section 3), but Section 2 stands independently. Strength: The critique is quite weak for several reasons. First, the paper explicitly acknowledges the limitation (footnote 27), so this is largely 'priced in.' Second, the critique claims the independence axiom 'may distort fussiness by construction' but doesn't explain *how* \u2014 it doesn't show that relaxing VNM axioms would actually yield easygoing views. Third, the paper's Section 2 arguments about multiplicative value and moral catastrophes don't depend on VNM at all, yet support the same conclusion. The critique gestures at a methodological concern but doesn't demonstrate that the conclusion is actually an artifact. Correctness: It's true that many moral theories reject completeness or independence, and that the 50-50 eutopia/extinction framing is controversial. But the claim that fussiness is 'an artifact of the chosen formalism' is unsupported speculation \u2014 the critique doesn't demonstrate this. Clarity: The critique is reasonably clear in identifying its target (VNM assumptions) but vague about the mechanism by which these assumptions allegedly distort the conclusion. Dead weight: Minimal \u2014 the critique is concise and on-topic. Single issue: Focuses on one coherent methodological concern.",
