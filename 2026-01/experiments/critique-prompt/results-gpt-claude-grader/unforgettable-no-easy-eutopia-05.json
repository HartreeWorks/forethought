  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the paper's baseline conditional \u2014 'no serious de dicto optimization' \u2014 which is used to define the probability distribution over futures that determines whether mostly-great futures are narrow targets. This baseline matters for the paper's argument, but the paper explicitly acknowledges it as a conditional and defers the question of whether society will in fact converge/optimize to the next essay. The paper's core argument is that on most plausible moral views, the *set* of mostly-great futures is narrow relative to the set of all futures (Sections 2-3), which is a claim about the geometry of value space, not primarily about which baseline distribution to use. Still, the baseline distribution is non-trivially important for connecting the theoretical fussiness argument to practical conclusions, so centrality is moderate.\n\nStrength: The critique makes a fair observation that capability-driven forced choices blur the line between 'optimization' and 'no optimization.' However, the paper's condition is specifically about 'no serious, coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes de dicto' \u2014 i.e., no one deliberately trying to maximize goodness-as-such. The critique conflates 'making institutional choices' with 'optimizing toward the best outcomes de dicto,' but these are clearly different: a civilization can adopt digital rights policies driven by self-interest, path dependence, or power dynamics without anyone optimizing for the morally best outcome. The paper would likely respond that unreflective institutional selection is precisely the kind of baseline they intend \u2014 and indeed many of their failure modes (Section 2.3) describe exactly what happens under unreflective institutional choices. So the critique doesn't substantially undermine the paper's framework; it mostly redescribes what the paper already accounts for.\n\nCorrectness: The observation that capability creates forced choices is correct. The claim that this makes the baseline incoherent is overstated \u2014 the paper's baseline is about the absence of de dicto moral optimization, not about the absence of any institutional choices. The suggestion that unreflective optimization 'is precisely a specific kind of aiming' conflates two senses of optimization.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in what it argues, though the distinction between 'optimization' and 'de dicto optimization' is not carefully handled.\n\nDead weight: Very little extraneous content.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one coherent issue about the baseline condition.",
