  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets Section 3.5 on moral uncertainty, which is a supplementary discussion rather than a load-bearing part of the argument. The paper's core argument for 'no easy eutopia' rests on (1) the fragility/multiplicativity argument in Section 2, and (2) the systematic analysis in Sections 3.2-3.4 showing that most plausible individual moral views are fussy. Section 3.5 explicitly says 'we don't want to push any strong conclusions' and offers only 'two substantial upshots.' Even if the moral uncertainty section were entirely undermined, the paper's main thesis\u2014that most individual plausible moral views are fussy\u2014would stand intact. The critique would only weaken a secondary claim about what happens when you aggregate across views. Centrality ~0.3.\n\nStrength: The critique makes a valid observation that the pairwise anchoring approach involves contentious judgments and that affine freedom creates real indeterminacy. However, the paper already explicitly acknowledges this problem: it notes 'intertheoretic comparisons are very thorny' and that 'plausible approaches to uncertainty disagree over which somewhat plausible-seeming options are best.' The paper presents multiple normalization methods and notes they give different results. The critique's key claim\u2014that 'small shifts in anchoring judgments could flip which views dominate'\u2014is largely priced in by the paper's own hedged presentation. The paper only claims that 'if anything' unbounded views loom larger on 'both the most plausible statistical and most plausible non-statistical approaches,' not that this is robust across all reasonable choices. The critique doesn't identify a specific alternative anchoring that would make the aggregate easygoing, which would be needed to seriously threaten even this subsidiary conclusion. Strength ~0.35.\n\nCorrectness: The critique is largely correct that affine freedom makes intertheoretic comparisons sensitive to anchoring choices, and that the paper leans on specific normalization choices. The claim about parameter sensitivity is true in general. However, the characterization that 'the whole case for fussiness under moral uncertainty hinges on specific anchoring judgments' overstates things\u2014the case for fussiness primarily rests on the analysis of individual views, not the uncertainty aggregation. Correctness ~0.7.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear about what it's attacking\u2014the intertheoretic comparison step\u2014though the parenthetical about metaphysics of persons is somewhat underdeveloped. Clarity ~0.7.\n\nDead weight: Minimal. Single issue: Yes, focuses on one issue. Overall: Low because the attacked section is supplementary, the paper already acknowledges the limitation, and the critique doesn't provide a concrete alternative that would yield easygoingness under uncertainty.",
