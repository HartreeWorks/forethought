  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets a core inference in the paper \u2014 that the diversity of moral views and historical moral failures implies the target of mostly-great futures is narrow. This is indeed central to the argument; if this inference fails, the 'no easy eutopia' thesis is significantly weakened. However, the paper makes this case through multiple independent channels (the multiplicative model, the systematic analysis of bounded/unbounded views in Section 3), so attacking just the historical-moral-failure argument doesn't undermine everything. Centrality ~0.75. Strength: Very low. The critique claims the paper commits a non sequitur from 'many views judge our world deeply flawed' to 'mostly-great futures are unlikely by default,' and that it slides from 'can go badly' to 'probably will go badly.' But the paper explicitly addresses this: Section 2.2 acknowledges that current flaws might be resolved with abundance, then Section 2.3 argues that even under abundance many specific failure modes persist, Section 2.4 provides the multiplicative model as a formal bridge, and Section 3 provides systematic formal analysis. The paper is quite explicit that the probabilistic bridge comes from the multiplicative structure of value and the formal analysis of moral views, not merely from the observation of historical failures. The critique doesn't engage with any of these specific arguments. It essentially asserts a gap exists without showing it. Strength ~0.15. Correctness: The critique is partially correct that historical moral disagreement alone wouldn't establish the conclusion \u2014 but the paper doesn't rely solely on this. The claim that the paper 'slides' from possibility to probability is somewhat unfair given the formal apparatus in Sections 2.4 and 3. The characterization of the inference as a 'non sequitur' is too strong. ~0.45. Clarity: The critique is understandable but quite terse and vague. It doesn't specify which parts of the argument it considers the non sequitur, doesn't engage with the multiplicative model or the formal analysis, and uses broad characterizations ('probabilistic bridge') without precision. ~0.55. Dead weight: Minimal \u2014 the critique is short and on-topic. ~0.1. Single issue: Focuses on essentially one issue \u2014 the alleged inferential gap. ~0.85. Overall: The critique identifies a potentially interesting concern (the gap between 'moral failure is possible' and 'mostly-great futures are unlikely') but fails to engage with the paper's actual arguments that bridge this gap. It reads as a surface-level objection that would be obvious to the authors and is in fact addressed extensively in the paper. Very low overall impact.",
