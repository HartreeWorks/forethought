  "reasoning": "The critique raises a 'practical consequence' objection: if society internalizes the 'no easy eutopia' thesis, it could produce paralysis and centralized veto power via weaponized moral uncertainty. However, the position is primarily an analytical/descriptive argument about whether eutopia is a big or narrow target across plausible moral views. The position explicitly acknowledges (Sec 2.3.5) the risk of hyper-vigilance and notes it as one of many possible moral catastrophes. It also explicitly defers the question of what to *do* about eutopian fragility to the next essay on convergence and compromise. So the critique attacks a practical implication that the position (a) already flags and (b) doesn't depend on \u2014 the position's core claims about the narrowness of the target stand regardless of whether the policy response to that narrowness is wise or foolish. This gives low centrality. Strength is also low because the position never advocates for a regime of perpetual moral precaution; it merely argues the target is narrow. The critique conflates 'the target is narrow' with 'society should adopt extreme precautionary governance,' which is not argued. The critique's factual claims are partially correct \u2014 it is true that moral uncertainty can be weaponized, and that excessive caution can cause stagnation \u2014 but these points are already priced in by the position. Clarity is decent; the argument is understandable. Single issue: yes, it focuses on one point. Overall score is low because the critique addresses a downstream policy implication rather than the analytical core, and the position already acknowledges essentially this concern.",
