  "reasoning": "Centrality: The 99.99th percentile definition of 'best feasible future' is indeed a foundational element of the paper's framework\u2014it sets the scale against which 'mostly-great' (>0.5) and 'eutopia' (>0.9) are measured. If this anchor were shown to be purely artifactual, it would undermine the quantitative framework. However, the paper's argument doesn't rest solely on this definitional choice. The core arguments\u2014multiplicative value structure, the systematic survey of moral views in Section 3 showing most are fussy\u2014proceed largely independently of the exact percentile chosen. The paper explicitly notes 'there's nothing magical about the mostly great threshold.' So the critique targets something meaningful but not fully load-bearing: ~0.6 centrality.\n\nStrength: The critique raises a legitimate concern about scale-sensitivity, but doesn't successfully refute the attacked claim. The paper is actually quite aware of this issue\u2014it discusses at length how different normalizations and anchoring points affect conclusions (Section 3.5), and the Section 3 analysis proceeds by examining structural properties of value functions (linearity, boundedness, aggregation method) rather than relying on the percentile anchor. The critique claims fussiness is 'nearly tautological' given fat tails, but this conflates two things: (1) the definitional framework and (2) the substantive argument that value distributions ARE fat-tailed and that most moral views generate such distributions. The paper argues for fat tails on independent grounds. Moreover, on linear unbounded views, the fussiness result follows from the structure of the view itself, not from where you set the 99.99th percentile. The critique would be stronger if it showed that under alternative anchoring, the paper's conclusions flip\u2014but it doesn't do this. ~0.3 strength.\n\nCorrectness: It's true that percentile-based anchoring can create artifacts, and it's true that fat-tailed distributions combined with extreme-percentile anchoring will mechanically make most outcomes look small relative to the anchor. But the claim that this makes the conclusion 'nearly tautological' overstates the case\u2014the paper provides multiple independent arguments for fussiness across different moral frameworks. The critique is partially correct but somewhat misleading about the degree to which the conclusion depends on this single definitional choice.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in identifying the mechanism of concern (percentile-based normalization stretching the scale), though it could be more precise about exactly which results it claims are artifactual vs. substantive.\n\nDead weight: Minimal\u2014the critique stays focused on its point.\n\nSingle issue: Clearly focuses on one issue (the percentile anchoring choice).\n\nOverall: The critique identifies a real methodological concern but significantly underestimates how much of the paper's argument is robust to alternative anchoring choices. The Section 3 analysis of bounded vs. unbounded views, separate vs. joint aggregation, etc., proceeds largely independently of the specific percentile chosen. The insight is partially 'priced in' by the paper's own extensive discussion of normalization choices.",
