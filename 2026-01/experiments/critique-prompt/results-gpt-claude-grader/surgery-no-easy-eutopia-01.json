  "reasoning": "Centrality: The multiplicative model is one of the key supporting arguments for the 'no easy eutopia' thesis (Section 2.4), but the position doesn't rest solely on it. The position also makes extensive formal arguments in Section 3 about bounded/unbounded views being fussy, which are independent of the multiplicative model. Still, attacking the multiplicative intuition does meaningfully weaken the position, so centrality is moderate.\n\nStrength: The critique's core idea\u2014that retroactive compensation/repair could make flaws temporary rather than multiplicative\u2014is largely anticipated and addressed by the position. The essay explicitly discusses irreversibility in the context of space resource allocation ('initial periods of settlement... will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available'), locked-in values, and the general point that early decisions can have permanent effects. More importantly, many of the 'flaws' discussed (wrong population ethics, wrong wellbeing theory, wrong discount rate) are not the kind that can be 'retroactively compensated'\u2014if you build a civilization of 10^22 stars optimized for the wrong conception of wellbeing, you can't easily retroactively fix that. The critique assumes substitutability and reversibility without arguing that these properties actually hold for the specific moral catastrophes the essay discusses. The essay's Section 3 formal arguments about fussiness don't depend on the multiplicative model at all, and those arguments are untouched. So the critique only partially engages with the weakest form of the position's argument.\n\nCorrectness: It's true that some value-relevant factors could be partially reversible and substitutable rather than strictly multiplicative. But the claim that 'retroactive compensation' can work for things like population ethics or the treatment of digital beings is speculative and not well-supported. The critique is partially correct in identifying that irreversibility is an important unstated assumption, but overstates how much this undermines the argument.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in its structure\u2014it identifies a claim, proposes a countermodel, and draws a conclusion. The specific example (reversible computing, restoring memories) is somewhat vague but understandable.\n\nDead weight: Minimal dead weight.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one issue\u2014reversibility/compensability of moral flaws.",
