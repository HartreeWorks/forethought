  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific, later-stage support claim: that under moral uncertainty, \u201cfairest/plausible\u201d intertheoretic comparisons tend to make the overall stance fussy (by giving unbounded views more weight). This is relevant but not load-bearing for the paper\u2019s main \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 conclusion, which is also supported by earlier sections (fragility/product-of-factors argument; fussiness across many value functions). So centrality is moderate-low. Strength is moderate: pointing out anchor/normalization sensitivity is a real vulnerability in the paper\u2019s moral-uncertainty upshot, and it plausibly downgrades the claim from \u201cfairest methods are fussy\u201d to \u201csome plausible methods are fussy,\u201d but it does not show that the paper\u2019s preferred approaches are incoherent or that robustness is impossible\u2014just under-argued. Correctness is high: it accurately identifies affine freedom, dependence on contentious pairwise comparability claims, and the governance-relevance of robustness; it does not make obviously false technical claims. Clarity is high: the attacked claim, mechanism (anchoring), and implication are explicit. Dead weight is low. It stays focused on a single parameter-sensitivity issue.",
