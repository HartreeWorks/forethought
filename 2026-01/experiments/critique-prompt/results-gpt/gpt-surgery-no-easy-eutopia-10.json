  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific sub-argument in \u00a73.3: that bounded, separately-aggregating views become extremely fussy because even ~1/10^22 of resources used for \u201cbads\u201d prevents a mostly-great future. This is moderately central: that example is a notable pillar for the claim that even bounded views are generally fussy, but the overall position also relies heavily on other routes to fussiness (fragility/multiplicative factors, unbounded-linear arguments, and critiques of joint aggregation/difference-making boundedness). If the 10^22 illustration failed, the essay\u2019s conclusion would be weakened but far from refuted.\n\nStrength is moderate. The critique plausibly identifies that the numerical \u201cone part in 10^22\u201d conclusion depends on parameter choices about how quickly disvalue saturates (and on how the bound is calibrated relative to a \u2018star-system\u2019 scale of bads). If saturation can be set to occur at vastly larger amounts of bads, then that specific brittleness claim doesn\u2019t follow. However, the essay\u2019s argument isn\u2019t purely a threshold artifact: even with concavity, separately aggregating bounded views can still make overall value quite sensitive to dispersed bads once you scale to cosmic resources; and choosing a very slow saturation to avoid sensitivity risks making the bads term nearly linear across the relevant range (reintroducing fussiness or making the bound practically irrelevant). The critique gestures at this but doesn\u2019t engage it, so it weakens rather than decisively refutes.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it is right that the argument depends on additive scaling of bads and on how the bounded function is parameterized; and it is right that without a principled calibration, the extremal sensitivity can look like a tunable modeling artifact. It overreaches somewhat in implying it can \u201ceasily become tolerate a nontrivial fraction of bads\u201d without noting the tradeoff with making the bound/high-curvature irrelevant over astronomically large resource ranges or with the essay\u2019s asymmetry considerations.\n\nClarity is high: it\u2019s clear what assumption is being attacked and what would be needed to defend it. Dead weight is low. It stays focused on one issue.",
