  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key support for the paper\u2019s claim that (on linear/unbounded views) even large-scale prosperous futures are likely far from mostly-great because value-efficiency is fat-tailed, making the near-optimal \u201cconfiguration\u201d a narrow target. However, this fat-tail argument is only one strand in a larger case for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d (e.g., multiplicative fragility across many moral dimensions, bounded-view fussiness, bads sensitivity, etc.), so even fully defusing it wouldn\u2019t collapse the whole position (moderate centrality). Substantively, the critique makes a plausible point: empirical fat tails in wealth/citations may be a poor reference class for the distribution of moral value-per-resource, and advanced optimization could turn rare high-value designs into widely replicable templates, weakening the inference from \u201cfat tails exist in many domains\u201d to \u201cdefault futures are very unlikely to be near-best.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t decisively refute the paper\u2019s claim, because (i) replication of a known optimum is compatible with fat-tailed value across the broader space of possible uses, (ii) the paper\u2019s narrow-target claim can survive if social/political lock-in or misalignment prevents finding/implementing the template, and (iii) the paper could argue that the landscape remains rugged or that there are multiple competing \u201cmaxima\u201d under moral uncertainty. So it moderately weakens rather than overturns the attacked step (moderate strength). Most statements are reasonable and not clearly false, though a couple are speculative (e.g., that optimization \u201csmooths\u201d the distribution) and thus not fully secure (good but not perfect correctness). The critique is clear, focused on one issue, and contains little to no fluff.",
