  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s Pivot P3: the claim that (under the most plausible intertheoretic-comparison methods) unbounded views should loom larger under moral uncertainty, making the \u201cfairest\u201d aggregations fussy and thus giving the no-easy-eutopia conclusion decision-theoretic bite. That\u2019s a meaningful part of the essay\u2019s synthesis, but not the core of the overall case: much of the essay argues that most plausible *single* moral views are fussy and that eutopia is fragile even without aggregating across views. So centrality is moderate rather than high.\n\nOn strength: the critique mainly highlights contingency/underdetermination (normalization choice matters; alternative normalizations could reverse the practical recommendation), and demands a principled defense or a more conditional conclusion. This does weaken the robustness of P3, but it doesn\u2019t show that the authors\u2019 preferred normalizations are wrong\u2014only that they\u2019re contestable and that other reasonable choices exist. Also, the essay already acknowledges the thorniness and that different methods disagree, which reduces how much the critique newly damages the position.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it is true that intertheoretic scaling can swing recommendations and that, without a defensible scaling story, \u201call-things-considered\u201d guidance under moral uncertainty is less robust. The main overreach is suggesting the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d thesis loses decision relevance entirely; it still has bite conditional on many individual theories being fussy (and on the essay\u2019s non-uncertainty arguments). The critique is clear, focused on a single issue, and contains little dead weight.",
