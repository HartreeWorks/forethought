  "reasoning": "The critique targets one sub-claim in the essay\u2019s Section 3: that on unbounded linear (resource-additive) views, being mostly-great requires capturing/using nearly all accessible resources, so a merely Milky-Way-scale future is ~1/20B of the best feasible future. This is relevant to one route to the essay\u2019s broader conclusion that many plausible moral views are \u201cfussy,\u201d but it is not the whole case (the essay also argues fussiness from other sources like moral fragility, multiplicative factors, and bounded/separately-aggregating views). So centrality is moderate.\n\nThe critique\u2019s core point\u2014expansion can have risk/governance externalities such that marginal expected value of expansion could be negative\u2014is a real challenge to any inference from \u2018linear value in resources\u2019 to \u2018must expand to be mostly-great\u2019 if the essay is implicitly doing an expected-value argument over realistic strategies. However, the essay\u2019s claim is closer to a counterfactual about attained value conditional on \u201csurvival\u201d and on capturing the accessible universe, not an all-things-considered recommendation under risk; and a linear value function alone doesn\u2019t guarantee \u201caggressive expansion\u201d is optimal under uncertainty, it just says that if you don\u2019t expand you leave value on the table. The critique therefore weakens the necessity/implication as stated, but doesn\u2019t refute it: the essay could reply by distinguishing (i) maximum achievable value in a given realised future from (ii) optimal policy under expansion risk; or by conditioning on successful expansion without increasing existential risk (already partly in their survival conditioning). Hence limited strength.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it is true that expansion could increase accident surface area, conflict, and lock-in risks, and that this could break a naive \u201cmore resources always higher expected value\u201d move. Minor overreach: it calls this a \u201cquantitative cliff\u201d and suggests it contradicts \u201cnecessity,\u201d but the essay\u2019s scale argument is about comparative magnitude under linear aggregation, not a strict policy requirement.\n\nClarity is high and it stays on one issue with little extraneous material. Dead weight is low.",
