  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific illustrative sub-claim in \u00a72.3.4 about early space-resource allocation being path-dependent and prone to lasting moral error. That point supports (but is not necessary for) the essay\u2019s broader \u201ceutopia is fragile / no easy eutopia\u201d thesis, so centrality is low-moderate. If the critique were fully right, it mostly strengthens the paper\u2019s pessimism about default trajectories rather than undermining it; it mainly attacks a strawier framing (\u201cpretends we can cleanly choose an allocation scheme reflectively\u201d) rather than the core argument that many non-obvious moral failure modes exist. Still, it offers some independent empirical support that one particular failure mode (conquest + legal rationalization) is a strong attractor, so it modestly bolsters the \u2018default bad lock-in\u2019 worry and slightly shifts probability mass away from \u2018easy eutopia\u2019. Correctness is fairly high: the historical analogy (colonialism, path dependence, post hoc legitimation) is broadly credible, but it overgeneralizes (\u201cdefault\u201d/near-inevitable) and imputes a stronger assumption to the paper than is clearly present. Clarity is good and focused, with minimal dead weight and essentially one issue throughout. Overall impact on the position is limited (low centrality, only moderate refutation of what it attacks).",
