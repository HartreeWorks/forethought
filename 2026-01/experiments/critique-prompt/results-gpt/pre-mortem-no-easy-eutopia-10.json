  "reasoning": "The critique targets an implied policy/methodological takeaway (\u201ckeep everything revisable; avoid lock-in\u201d) rather than the paper\u2019s core thesis that (conditional on survival) mostly-great futures are a narrow target because value is fragile and most plausible moral views are fussy. If the critique\u2019s point about the need for durable commitments were accepted, it would mainly weaken a potential anti-lock-in emphasis or a naive \u2018reversibility is always good\u2019 stance, not the central \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 conclusion\u2014hence low-moderate centrality. Strength is limited because the paper already gestures at a closely related meta-level failure mode (over-vigilance/overbearing governance to avoid moral error causing harm), so the critique is partly \u201cpriced in\u201d and doesn\u2019t directly rebut the multiplicative-fragility/fussiness arguments. The underlying claim that durable commitments enable accountability, verification, and long-term coordination is broadly plausible (raising correctness), but the critique likely overstates what the paper \u2018drove\u2019 (a movement) and somewhat straw-mans the paper as assuming reversibility is mostly good. The argument is clear, focused on one issue, and contains little filler.",
