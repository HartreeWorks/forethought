  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s percentile-based definition/normalization of \u201cbest feasible future\u201d (99.99th percentile) and claims the resulting \u201ceutopia is hard\u201d conclusion is largely an artifact of this choice, especially in fat-tailed/high-variance outcome spaces. This is relevant but not fully central: much of the essay\u2019s core case for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d comes from substantive claims about value fragility, many independent moral \u2018failure modes,\u2019 multiplicative-factor modeling, and especially the later argument that many plausible moral views are intrinsically fussy (linear/unbounded, bounded-but-approximately-linear, separate aggregation with tiny bads, etc.). Those arguments don\u2019t primarily rely on percentile normalization; the percentile is mainly a convenient scaling to [0,1]. Still, the critique would weaken some rhetorical/quantitative comparisons (e.g., \u201c60\u201340 gamble vs wonderful futures,\u201d thresholding at 0.5/0.9) and any inference that rarity is demonstrated rather than stipulated by the benchmark.\n\nStrength is moderate-low: it\u2019s true that choosing an extreme percentile as \u20181\u2019 can make intermediate percentiles look small under heavy tails and that this can manufacture large ratios. But the paper\u2019s key target is probability mass above fixed fractions of the top outcome (0.5, 0.9) rather than gaps between percentiles per se, and their later fussiness arguments aim to show that (under many moral views) near-best requires specific resource use / near-zero bads regardless of the percentile scaling. So the critique does not \u201cnearly automatically\u201d generate the main conclusion, though it does expose a genuine risk of conflating a normalization choice with an empirical claim about how disappointing typical futures are.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high but not perfect: the point about percentile normalization interacting with fat tails is broadly correct; the claim that the conclusion is essentially an artifact is overstated given the paper\u2019s independent substantive premises. Clarity is high and dead weight is minimal. It cleanly focuses on a single methodological issue. Overall, it\u2019s a useful methodological caution but not a devastating objection to the full position.",
