  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real inferential step in Sec. 3.3: the move from \u201cbounded over universe-as-a-whole\u201d to \u201cpractically linear, hence fussy,\u201d which the essay motivates partly via a very large universe and likely many alien civilizations making humanity\u2019s marginal contribution tiny. If that empirical/cosmological setup fails, the \u2018locally linear\u2019 argument for that subclass of bounded views is weakened, which moderately matters to the essay\u2019s broader claim that most plausible views are fussy (though the essay also has independent routes to fussiness: unbounded-linear views, high-bound difference-making views being near-linear, and low-bound separate-aggregation views being fussy via \u2018tiny bads\u2019). The objection is fairly strong as a conditional vulnerability/parameter-sensitivity point, but it likely doesn\u2019t \u201cflip\u201d the overall conclusion by itself because (i) the essay can replace \u201caliens\u201d with the weaker premise \u201cwe are far from saturation given enormous attainable value,\u201d and (ii) even if universe-as-a-whole bounded views aren\u2019t near-linear, other considered bounded views can still be fussy. The critique is mostly correct, clearly stated, focused on one issue, and contains little fluff.",
