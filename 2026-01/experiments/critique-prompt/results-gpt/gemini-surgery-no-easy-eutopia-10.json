  "reasoning": "The critique targets the moral-uncertainty move that could, in principle, bolster the essay\u2019s \u201cfussy in practice even under uncertainty\u201d upshot; that\u2019s a meaningful but not necessary pillar for the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion (which is also supported by the earlier fragility/product-of-factors and value-function fussiness arguments). So centrality is moderate. Substantively, it correctly notes that intertheoretic aggregation/normalization choices can flip recommendations in the essay\u2019s own toy examples and that a robust, representation-invariant dominance claim is not shown. However, it overstates the essay\u2019s commitment: the original text already emphasizes thorniness, shows disagreement between methods, and hedges conclusions, so the critique is partly \u2018priced in\u2019. The proposed alternative normalization (\u201caction-guidingness under bounded rationality / realistically reachable outcome set\u201d) is under-specified and not argued to be independently plausible or to systematically favor easygoing views, reducing refutational force. Overall, it raises a real conditionality/robustness challenge to one strand of the argument, but doesn\u2019t strongly undermine the main thesis.",
