  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific bridge claim in \u00a73.3: that \u201cuniverse-as-a-whole\u201d bounded, concave value functions become approximately linear over the tiny interval of humanity\u2019s marginal influence, implying fussiness. This is relevant to one strand of the paper\u2019s case that bounded views are also fussy, but it is not the paper\u2019s whole argument (there are other routes to fussiness: unbounded-linear views, difference-making bounded views, separate aggregation sensitivity to bads, plus the earlier \u2018fragility\u2019 considerations). So centrality is moderate-low.\n\nOn strength: the critique plausibly shows that the \u2018tiny interval\u2019 premise relies on substantive cosmological/moral assumptions (lots of morally relevant value outside our control; our actions are a tiny perturbation; additivity/independence-like structure), and that alternative assumptions could block the inference. However, it doesn\u2019t fully undercut the authors\u2019 move because (i) the \u201csmall interval \u2248 linear\u201d step is a mathematical local approximation that holds given differentiability/concavity once the \u2018small marginal share\u2019 premise is granted, and (ii) the critique\u2019s alternatives (simulation control, rare-event dominance, causal connectedness) are sketched rather than argued to be likely, and some (like \u201caliens near-irrelevant\u201d) shift to different moral frameworks rather than directly rebutting the universe-as-a-whole bounded-concave setup. Thus it weakens but doesn\u2019t refute.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it\u2019s true the argument is parameter-sensitive to assumptions about cosmological scale, moral relevance of far-away value, and the size of the interval over which we\u2019re evaluating curvature. Some examples are speculative but presented as conditionals, not assertions. Clarity is high: it clearly identifies the load-bearing claim and the failure mode. Dead weight is low: nearly all content serves the point. Single-issue is high though not perfect, since it mixes several distinct ways the premise could fail (cosmology, causal connectedness, moral irrelevance of aliens), but they all support one objection.\n\nOverall: anchored to centrality\u00d7strength \u2248 0.16, then slightly up for clarity/insight and down because it doesn\u2019t engage the other major arguments for fussiness and relies on speculative counters; net ~0.20.",
