  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real supporting move in the essay: using pervasive historical moral error to motivate \"eutopia is fragile\" and that severe, non-obvious flaws are common. If that inductive projection fails under future improved epistemics/institutions, one important intuitive pillar for \"no easy eutopia\" weakens, though the position also relies heavily on other arguments (multiplicative-factor model, population ethics/digital beings/space allocation examples, and Section 3\u2019s fussy-value-function taxonomy). Hence moderate centrality. The critique\u2019s mechanism-level point is substantive: it identifies a hidden lemma (persistence of moral blindness) and provides a plausible defeater scenario (high transparency, reversible experimentation, AI-augmented deliberation) that would undercut the specific historical-induction support; but it doesn\u2019t show those conditions are likely, nor does it address other reasons the essay gives for persistent error (e.g., motivated cognition, power/lock-in, coordination problems could persist even with better epistemics). So it partially weakens, not refutes. Most claims are plausible and largely accurate as a critique; the main overstatement is implying the essay \"repeatedly\" relies on this as decisive evidence rather than one strand among several. It is clear, focused on one issue, and contains little to no fluff.",
