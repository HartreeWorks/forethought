  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the essay\u2019s VNM/cardinalization setup and the 0.5/0.9 thresholds used to define \u201cmostly-great/eutopia\u201d and to classify views as \u201cfussy/easygoing,\u201d which is central to Section 3\u2019s systematic argument and to some headline claims about \u201cmost plausible moral views.\u201d But the essay also offers substantial non-VNM, informal support (fragility/product-of-factors, historical moral catastrophe examples), so refuting the VNM framework wouldn\u2019t fully collapse the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion.\n\nStrength: The critique shows a real limitation: many plausible moral views with lexical constraints, incomparability, or non-expected-value structure won\u2019t satisfy VNM completeness/independence, making the quantitative thresholds and some probability/gamble comparisons inapplicable. However, the essay explicitly acknowledges that not all moral views fit (it restricts the technical section to complete/VNM-satisfying views and notes some views can\u2019t be represented), so calling it \u201cwindow-dressing\u201d overreaches. The best version of the objection is: the paper later generalizes from this restricted class to \u201cmost plausible views,\u201d and that generalization is under-supported. Still, this only partially undermines the paper because (i) many influential moral theories do accept VNM-style representation for prospects, and (ii) the nontechnical sections can be run without exact cardinal thresholds.\n\nCorrectness: Largely correct that many deontic/lexical/incomparability views violate VNM axioms and that independence is contentious under moral uncertainty, so the machinery won\u2019t apply broadly. Likely overstated/partly incorrect to imply the authors don\u2019t already flag the restriction or that their entire argument becomes \u201cundefined\u201d (they can still argue about narrowness qualitatively, or treat lexical constraints as making the target even narrower). Also the critique conflates intra-theory VNM independence with intertheoretic aggregation issues; the essay\u2019s VNM assumption is about a single view over prospects, not primarily about moral uncertainty.\n\nClarity: The objection is understandable and points to a specific failure mode (non-VNM moral views make the 0.5/0.9 framework inapplicable), though some terms (\u201cnotorious for violating independence under moral uncertainty\u201d) are a bit compressed.\n\nDead weight: Low; most sentences support the same point, though a few rhetorical flourishes (\u201cwindow-dressing,\u201d \u201cbroad authority \u2026 just false\u201d) add little.\n\nSingle issue: Yes\u2014focused on the VNM/cardinalization/thresholding applicability.\n\nOverall: Moderate-to-weak critique. It highlights a genuine scope limitation and an overgeneralization risk, but doesn\u2019t decisively undercut the broader thesis and somewhat misses that the essay already partially anticipates the limitation.",
