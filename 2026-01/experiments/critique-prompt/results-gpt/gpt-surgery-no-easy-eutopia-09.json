  "reasoning": "The critique targets one step in Sec. 3.3: the claim that bounded \u201cuniversal value\u201d views are practically linear because humanity\u2019s marginal contribution is tiny relative to (possibly infinite) cosmic value. This is a supporting move for the essay\u2019s broader \u201cmost plausible views are fussy\u201d conclusion, but it is not the whole case (the essay also argues fussiness from moral-catastrophe fragility/multiplicativity, unbounded linear views, and bounded difference-making views). So centrality is moderate-low. The critique\u2019s core point is fairly strong: the linearization depends on (i) a substantive cosmological premise and (ii) a particular evaluative domain/aggregation assumption (global impartial aggregation across the whole universe), and many moral frameworks instead restrict evaluation to the affectable region or are agent-/responsibility-relative, in which case the \u2018tiny marginal\u2019 premise fails and bounded concavity might matter. However, the essay itself already frames this as \u201cthe most natural\u201d bounded view and then explores other bounded forms; plus even if the linearization fails, bounded views can still be fussy for other reasons the essay discusses. So it weakens that subargument but doesn\u2019t overturn the main thesis. Most claims in the critique are plausible and largely accurate, though some parts are a bit overstated (e.g., that restricting to affectable region is \u201ccommon\u201d and that this alone makes easygoingness \u201cfar less narrow and specific\u201d without engaging the essay\u2019s other bounded-view fussiness arguments). Clear, focused, and with little extraneous material.",
