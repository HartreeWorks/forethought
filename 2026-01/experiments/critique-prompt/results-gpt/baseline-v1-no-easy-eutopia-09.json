  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s claim (especially in \u00a73.2) that under linear/unbounded views, value-per-resource is likely fat-tailed enough that only very specific uses capture most attainable value. This is a meaningful support for the broader \u201cfussy views / narrow target\u201d conclusion, but it is not the whole case (the essay also argues from multiplicative fragility, population ethics, digital welfare, bounded-view sensitivity to bads, etc.), so centrality is moderate. The critique\u2019s substantive point\u2014analogies to wealth/citations don\u2019t by themselves justify a fat-tailed moral value-efficiency distribution, and the extrapolation to future value is under-argued\u2014does weaken that subargument, but it doesn\u2019t decisively refute it (the position offers additional motivations like extreme experience tails and structural considerations about searching a vast space of configurations). The critique is mostly correct, clear, and focused, with little dead weight, but overall it poses only a limited problem for the position rather than a major one.",
