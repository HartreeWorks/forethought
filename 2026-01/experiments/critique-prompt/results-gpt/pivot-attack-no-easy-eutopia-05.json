  "reasoning": "The critique targets a key sub-argument in \u00a73.2: that on unbounded linear views, a fat-tailed distribution of value-per-resource makes mostly-great futures a very narrow target unless resources are used in near-optimal ways. If that inference fails, the paper\u2019s case that \u201clinear views are fussy\u201d is notably weakened, but it wouldn\u2019t by itself collapse the full \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 position because the essay also leans on other routes to fussiness (multiplicative fragility across dimensions; bounded-view arguments about bads; other moral-catastrophe mechanisms). The objection is moderately strong: it correctly notes that fat tails don\u2019t entail extreme sparsity of near-optima, and that design spaces can have broad near-optimal plateaus, so the authors would need an additional argument connecting fat tails to a small measure of >50%-optimal configurations. However, it doesn\u2019t fully rebut the authors\u2019 added considerations (e.g., separability/replicability claims, and the possibility that the distribution is not just fat-tailed but sharply concentrated away from near-optima), so it\u2019s more a gap-pointing challenge than a decisive refutation. The critique is mostly correct and clearly stated, tightly focused, with little to no dead weight.",
