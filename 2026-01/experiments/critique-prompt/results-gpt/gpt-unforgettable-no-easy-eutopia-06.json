  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets a recurring rhetorical/structural move in \u00a72 (\u201ceven if everyone approves/gets what they want, big value loss is possible\u201d) that supports the broader \u2018fragility\u2019 intuition, but it does not directly engage the essay\u2019s more technical Section 3 argument that most plausible value functions are fussy. So undermining this move would weaken a substantial pillar (the intuitive case for fragility), but not collapse the whole position.\n\nStrength: It successfully pressures the authors to clarify why universal approval isn\u2019t strong evidence against \u2018moral catastrophe\u2019 in their setup, and it identifies a tension: the essay uses \u201ceveryone approves\u201d to make the scenario seem non-dystopian while asserting large moral error without giving a metaethical/epistemic account. However, the position can likely patch this: the authors can say (and sometimes imply) that approval is weak evidence because preference adaptation, motivated cognition, path dependence, and moral uncertainty mean endorsement can persist despite error; also, their argument doesn\u2019t require \u2018strong moral realism\u2019 so much as the possibility of moral truth diverging from widespread attitudes under a VNM-representable ordering. Hence it weakens rather than refutes.\n\nCorrectness: Mostly right that \u201ceveryone approves\u201d is irrelevant to the defined value function unless supplemented with a story linking approval to value, and that the essay could better justify why endorsement might anti-track moral truth even under abundance. Some overstatement/possible misread: the essay isn\u2019t clearly \u201csmuggling\u201d preference metaethics; it explicitly defines value via a betterness relation and uses approval mainly to illustrate non-obvious flaws, not as evidential support. Also, \u201cuniversal approval is strong evidence (on many listed perspectives)\u201d is plausible but not generally true (many listed perspectives allow mass error).\n\nClarity: The objection is clearly stated, with a step-by-step structure and a concrete burden-shift (either defend endorsement-weakness or drop the rhetorical condition).\n\nDead weight: Low; nearly all sentences contribute to the single line of critique.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one coherent issue (the role of universal approval/what it evidentially contributes).\n\nOverall: A useful, insightful pressure on one motivating strand, but it doesn\u2019t seriously undermine the essay\u2019s main technical case and is partly patchable; thus moderate-to-low overall impact.",
