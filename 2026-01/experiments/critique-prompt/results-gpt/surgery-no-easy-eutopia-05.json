  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets a key step in Section 2 (\u201cFuture catastrophes are easy\u201d even in common-sense utopia), which supports the broader \u201ceutopia is fragile / narrow target\u201d thesis, but it doesn\u2019t engage the later Section 3 value-function argument; so undermining this would weaken but not collapse the whole position. Strength: The equilibrium/strategic-actors point plausibly reduces how \u2018default\u2019 some pathologies are (especially blatant exploitation/disenfranchisement of digital beings), but it doesn\u2019t show that bargaining reliably tracks moral truth or avoids large value loss under many moral views (e.g., population ethics scale, subtle welfare-theory errors, value lock-in, rights assignments that are stable yet morally wrong). Many failures could persist as stable equilibria. Thus it partially weakens the \u201ceasy mistake\u201d framing rather than refuting it. Correctness: It\u2019s broadly true that high-stakes issues become salient and contested and that equilibria/institutions can constrain extremes; however the implicit suggestion that this systematically pushes away from \u2018catastrophic\u2019 moral error is overstated and contestable. Clarity: The argument is readable, identifies the attacked claim, and gives a mechanism (equilibrium selection via bargaining/institutions), though it remains somewhat hand-wavy about which equilibria obtain and why they align with \u2018mostly-great\u2019. Dead weight: Minimal. Single-issue: Focused on one mechanism (strategic equilibrium makes errors less \u201ceasy\u201d). Overall: A moderately interesting objection that trims one supporting pillar, but it doesn\u2019t address other routes to \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 and doesn\u2019t establish that equilibrium dynamics generally yield mostly-great outcomes, so it\u2019s not a major problem for the position.",
