  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s use of \u201cviolates stochastic dominance\u201d as a reason to regard difference-making bounded views (a leading \u201ceasygoing\u201d candidate) as implausible, arguing this is dialectically unstable given the later intertheoretic aggregation/normalization discussion. This is moderately central: it undermines an important sub-argument for why easygoing views are rare/implausible, but it does not touch the broader Section 2 fragility argument, the multiplicative-factor model, or the claim that many other plausible views are fussy; the overall \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 conclusion could survive even if this particular strike against one easygoing slice weakened. Strength is moderate: it correctly notes that intertheoretic aggregation is not affine-invariant without extra structure, and that the essay itself emphasizes normalization sensitivity; this does create a coherence/double-standard pressure if one treats \u201cdominance violations\u201d as a decisive objection while accepting meta-level procedures with analogous representational sensitivity. However, the critique overreaches by implying the authors \u201cadopt\u201d a dominance-violating aggregation as their own evaluative method; the essay largely presents multiple approaches and flags the thorniness rather than committing to a single aggregation rule, and dominance is an axiom about within-theory choice under lotteries, not straightforwardly the same as intertheoretic comparability problems. Correctness is fairly high but not perfect for these overstatements/equivocations. Clarity is high: the alleged boomerang is spelled out stepwise. Dead weight is low, and it is essentially a single focused objection. Overall impact is limited because it weakens only one argumentative lever (a knock against one easygoing family) and is partly defused by the essay\u2019s own agnosticism about intertheoretic normalization.",
