  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real junction in the essay: the move from (i) pluralism/no-safe-option across moral perspectives to (ii) a formal comparison of \u201cfussiness\u201d across \u201cplausible moral views\u201d using VNM-style expected utility and intertheoretic aggregation (Sections 3\u20133.5). If that move failed, it would significantly weaken the paper\u2019s intended implication that default survival doesn\u2019t reliably yield mostly-great futures (since the paper explicitly leans on claims about what \u201cmost plausible views\u201d imply). However, the position does not purely rest on cross-view aggregation: Section 2 also aims to show, within many individual perspectives, that single non-obvious flaws can destroy a large fraction of value (\u201cfragility\u201d/multiplicative factors), so the thesis can survive as a within-view claim even if cross-view comparability is messier. The critique\u2019s main charge of self-undermining is only partly successful because the essay itself already flags representation limits and moral uncertainty problems (completeness/VNM restrictions, intertheoretic comparison thorniness), and the argument in 3 is largely conditional (\u201con plausible easygoing/fussy views, X follows\u201d) rather than requiring robust aggregation to get any conclusion. Still, it is correct that if one relaxes VNM comparability substantially, the quantitative fussiness apparatus loses force, and the policy-guidance bite becomes more viewpoint-relative. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little fluff, but it overstates the dilemma (\u201cabandon diversity or collapse\u201d) since the author can consistently: (a) treat pluralism as object-level disagreement about value while (b) still restricting analysis to a representable subset for tractability, and (c) draw conditional/agent-relative conclusions under moral uncertainty without claiming a unique all-things-considered aggregation.",
