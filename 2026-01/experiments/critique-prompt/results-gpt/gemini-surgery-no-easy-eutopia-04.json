  "reasoning": "The critique targets one illustrative move in \u00a72.3: using \u201cpreference engineering\u201d to argue that even an abundant, preference-satisfied society could still be morally catastrophic. This is relevant to the paper\u2019s broader \u201ceutopia is fragile / no easy eutopia\u201d thesis, but it is not load-bearing: the paper offers many other independent fragility mechanisms (population ethics, digital beings\u2019 rights, bads/goods aggregation, resource allocation, scale, etc.), and much of the argument in \u00a73 aims to show fussiness across many moral views, not hinging on this specific case. So centrality is modest.\n\nOn strength: the critique plausibly identifies a tension: if the interlocutor is genuinely \u201ceasygoing liberal / preference-satisfactionist,\u201d then calling preference-adapted satisfaction \u201ctragically mediocre\u201d risks smuggling in objective-list or external standards. This undercuts that particular example\u2019s force as a counterexample to easygoing liberalism. However, the paper could reply that (i) it is intentionally operating under moral pluralism/uncertainty and only needs some plausible views on which this is catastrophic, or (ii) even procedural liberalism may condemn certain preference-engineering pathways (coercion, manipulation, time-inconsistency). Because the critique mainly shows under-arguedness/overreach in one example rather than refuting the general fragility claim, strength is moderate.\n\nCorrectness is fairly high: it accurately characterizes a potential equivocation between \u201cgetting what they want\u201d and an evaluator\u2019s external value standard, and its proposed fixes are reasonable. It slightly overstates the extent to which the paper \u201cuses (a) then evaluates with (b)\u201d because the paper is explicitly canvassing many moral perspectives and is not committed to preference-satisfactionism; still, the local point stands. Clarity is high and the critique is tightly focused with little dead weight.",
