  "reasoning": "The critique targets one sub-argument in \u00a73.3: that bounded difference-making views with separate aggregation become extremely fussy because even a 1-in-10^22 fraction of bads blocks a mostly-great future. That point is relevant but not load-bearing for the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d thesis, which is also supported by many independent routes (multiplicative fragility, population ethics, digital welfare, linear/unbounded views, etc.), so centrality is moderate-low. The critique\u2019s main move\u2014denying the implicit scaling assumption that bads grow proportionally with expansion and arguing that prevention can scale faster\u2014is a plausible empirical/modelling objection and does weaken the illustrative 10^22 argument. However it doesn\u2019t fully refute fussiness: the paper\u2019s claim is about how the value function penalizes any nontrivial absolute amount of bads at cosmic scale, and even if enforcement improves, it\u2019s not shown that absolute bads can be driven sufficiently close to zero, nor that new \u201cbad-production\u201d channels (e.g., digital suffering at scale, value drift, incentive failures) won\u2019t scale too. So strength is limited. Most statements are broadly correct as possibilities (institutional/technological harm-reduction could scale), but it overstates \u201ccausal reversal\u201d and treats the hypersensitivity as merely an artifact without engaging the normative structure that makes tiny absolute bads decisive on separate-aggregation bounded views; hence not fully correct. It is clear and focused, with little fluff.",
