  "reasoning": "The critique targets a genuinely relevant support for the paper\u2019s \u201cfussy/narrow target\u201d conclusion\u2014namely, the move in the linear/unbounded discussion from fat-tailed value-efficiency to \u201cmust be aimed at a very specific configuration.\u201d If that move failed, it would weaken one important route to fussiness, but it would not collapse the broader position, which also relies on multi-factor fragility (Section 2) and bounded-view arguments; hence moderate centrality. Strength is limited: the paper\u2019s \u2018best feasible future\u2019 notion can already include robustness/longevity as part of what makes a configuration value-efficient, so pointing out that naive hyper-optimization Goodharts doesn\u2019t show the target is broad or easy\u2014optimal robust designs could still be narrow and hard to hit. The argument also assumes without support that slack reliably increases long-run expected value enough to overturn the ranking. Still, the core point (optimization can induce fragility; robustness can dominate snapshot efficiency) is often correct in analogous domains, so correctness is moderate. The critique is clear, focused on one issue, and contains little dead weight.",
