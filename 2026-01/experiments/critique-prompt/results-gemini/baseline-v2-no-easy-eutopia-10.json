  "reasoning": "The critique targets one specific plank in the paper\u2019s case against a narrow class of \u201ceasygoing\u201d views: low-bounded, difference-making, jointly-aggregating bounded views that the authors say face a scale-tipping pathology. If that objection were defused, it would modestly weaken the paper\u2019s claim that only a very narrow and implausible slice of views are easygoing, but it would not overturn the broader \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion because the paper also raises other objections to these views (e.g., difference-making boundedness/stochastic dominance issues, and pro-extinction worries) and offers independent reasons for fussiness (fragility/product model, linear/unbounded arguments). The critique\u2019s refutation is limited: it mostly asserts that threshold sensitivity is standard and can be acceptable, without directly engaging the authors\u2019 underlying worry (that an arbitrarily tiny net shift in vast-scale goods/bads flips evaluation from near-worst to near-best, which they argue is implausible and destabilizing, not merely \u2018thresholdy\u2019). It is fairly clear and focused with little dead weight, but somewhat overstates by implying the authors dismiss these views solely because they are threshold-like.",
