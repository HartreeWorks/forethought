  "reasoning": "Centrality is low-moderate because the critique targets one illustrative fragility (digital beings/rights) within a broad, multi-pronged case for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d; even if fully accepted it would mainly remove/complicate one example rather than undercut the overall thesis. Strength is low because the position already explicitly raises the reversal: it notes that giving digital beings full rights (including voting) could cause human values to be overridden and could be viewed as catastrophic on some moral perspectives; thus the critique is largely \u201cpriced in\u201d rather than a refutation. Correctness is mixed: the concern about copyable digital entities creating dominance pressures is plausible, but the claim that the paper \u2018assumes more rights = better\u2019 is significantly overstated given the paper\u2019s explicit discussion of over-rights as a risk. Clarity is high: the objection is easy to parse. Dead weight is low: nearly all content is part of the single argument. Single-issue focus is very high. Overall, the critique poses only a small problem for the position because it mostly reiterates a point the position already acknowledges.",
