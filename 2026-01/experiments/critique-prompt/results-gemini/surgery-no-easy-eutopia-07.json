  "reasoning": "The critique targets Section 3.5\u2019s moral-uncertainty normalization discussion, arguing the paper\u2019s apparent tilt toward variance/pairwise normalization is parameter-sensitive and partly question-begging. This is only mildly central to the overall thesis (\u201cno easy eutopia\u201d via fragility + fussiness across plausible value functions), because the core argument does not hinge on any one intertheoretic normalization scheme; 3.5 is explicitly presented as thorny and not decisive. Strength is limited because the paper itself already emphasizes normalization arbitrariness and shows different normalizations reverse recommendations; so the point is somewhat \u2018priced in\u2019 and doesn\u2019t substantially undercut the main conclusion. The critique is directionally correct that normalization choices can change which views dominate, but it overstates the paper as claiming we \u2018should\u2019 normalize to favor unbounded views, and the alternative \u2018capacity for satisfaction\u2019 normalization is underspecified. The critique is mostly clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",
