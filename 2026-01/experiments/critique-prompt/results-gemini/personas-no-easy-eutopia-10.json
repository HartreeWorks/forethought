  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s suggestion that hitting a narrow \u201cmostly-great\u201d target would likely require deliberate optimization/steering. That\u2019s somewhat connected to the essay\u2019s upshot, but not central to the core thesis (\u201ceutopia is fragile / the target is narrow\u201d); the essay does not propose specific steering institutions or emergency powers, and explicitly defers the steering question to a later essay. As a result, centrality is low-moderate. The critique\u2019s refutational force is weak: it largely asserts (without argument) that any steering institution will be captured and redefine eutopia, and it imputes a policy program (\u201cindefinite emergency powers\u201d) not defended in the text. Some underlying concerns (institutional capture risks, power misuse) are plausible in general, but the critique overstates them (\u201cimmediately captured by sociopaths\u201d) and relies on a strawman reading, so correctness is limited. It is clearly written, focused on one issue, and contains little dead-weight despite being rhetorically loaded.",
