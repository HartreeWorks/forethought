  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s treatment of unbounded linear views, where the argument leans on separability to infer that near-best futures require replicating highly value-efficient local configurations (\u201ctiling\u201d). That is a meaningful part of the essay\u2019s case for fussiness, but it is not the whole case (the essay also argues for fragility via many independent dimensions and for fussiness across many bounded-view structures). Hence centrality is moderate.\n\nThe critique\u2019s core point is plausible: if value is strongly holistic (e.g., depends on diversity/relations/global structure), then separability-style \u2018tile the cosmos with the best module\u2019 reasoning may fail, and the \u2018hyper-efficiency narrow target\u2019 conclusion could weaken. However, it doesn\u2019t show that (i) such holistic theories are common/plausible enough to overturn the essay\u2019s \u201cmost plausible views are fussy\u201d conclusion, or (ii) holism actually makes the target broad rather than just shifting what\u2019s hard (e.g., achieving the right kind/degree of diversity could itself be a narrow target). It also doesn\u2019t engage the essay\u2019s other routes to fussiness. So its refutational strength is limited.\n\nMost claims are broadly correct as a conditional objection, though it overstates by implying holism straightforwardly \u2018dissolves\u2019 narrow-target problems rather than potentially relocating them. The critique is clear, focused on a single issue, and contains little dead weight.",
