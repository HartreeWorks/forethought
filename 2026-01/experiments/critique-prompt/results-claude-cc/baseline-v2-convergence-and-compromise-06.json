  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s discussion of value-destroying threats (3.3) as an undermining factor for the optimism-from-trade route. That threat consideration matters to the paper\u2019s bottom-line uncertainty about whether trade yields mostly-great futures, but it is not the sole or primary pillar of the essay (which also leans heavily on anti-convergence arguments, power concentration, lock-in, etc.), so centrality is moderate. The critique\u2019s argumentative force is limited because it mostly objects to lack of empirical quantification rather than showing the threat argument is wrong; and the authors explicitly flag their uncertainty and limited investigation, which partially inoculates them against the charge. Still, the critique is largely correct that the section treats threats as potentially dominating expected value without offering much in the way of likelihoods, magnitudes, or grounded precedent, and it\u2019s stated clearly with little extraneous material.",
