  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s \u201clong views win\u201d / patient-values selection effect, claiming it may fail if lock-in happens before patient accumulators gain influence. This is only moderately central: it attacks one pro-convergence/pro-flourishing consideration in \u00a72.3.3, not the essay\u2019s main upshot (that WAM-convergence is unlikely and trade/compromise is the more promising route with many blockers). Strength is limited because the essay already explicitly notes the same timing objection (\u201cmight not have time to win out,\u201d major decisions may be made soon), so the critique adds little new refutation beyond reframing it as a \u2018quantitative cliff.\u2019 The underlying point is largely correct (selection effects depend on relevant timescales/decision windows), though it somewhat mischaracterizes the essay as \u2018assuming indefinite compounding\u2019 or that such views \u2018will dominate\u2019\u2014the essay presents it as a suggestive but non-decisive mechanism with caveats. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little-to-no dead weight.",
