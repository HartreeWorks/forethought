  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s discussion of whether superintelligent reflection/advice would drive moral convergence (2.3.1). But that discussion is not a load-bearing premise for the essay\u2019s conclusions; the essay already treats superintelligent advice as a limited and non-decisive pro-convergence factor and ultimately argues WAM-convergence is unlikely. So centrality is low. Strength is also low because it partly attacks a strawman (\u201cassumes\u201d superintelligence would make people converge) and does not engage the essay\u2019s explicit caveats (people may choose aligned advisors, reject de dicto motivation, resist alien reflective selves, etc.). Correctness is mixed: it\u2019s broadly true that much moral reasoning is intuitive and subject to motivated reasoning, but the critique overstates by implying reflection/argument almost never changes moral views and that decades of research have \u201cfalsified\u201d the convergence-through-reflection framework; the empirical literature is more nuanced (reasoning sometimes does shift moral judgments, especially via social interaction, deliberation, and changing factual beliefs). The critique is clear, focused on one issue, and has little dead weight.",
