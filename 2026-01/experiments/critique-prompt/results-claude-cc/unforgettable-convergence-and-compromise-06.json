  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s quantitative/ratio-style framing of \u2018how much potential Flourishing we capture\u2019 (e.g., 5\u201310% of what it might be) and argues it\u2019s incoherent under unbounded-above, linear-in-resources axiology. That is a real tension, but it\u2019s not fully central to the essay\u2019s main thrust (skepticism about WAM-convergence, conditional optimism about trade/compromise, and \u2018far from the ceiling\u2019 in a qualitative sense). If refuted, it would mostly undermine one rhetorical/measurement choice rather than the substantive convergence/bargaining arguments, so centrality is moderate. Strength is moderate because the point works against literal percentage-of-maximum talk, but is readily patchable (e.g., restrict to bounded axiologies/priors, use a finite reference class, or adopt bounded/normalized utility), and the essay already treats unboundedness as only one live possibility rather than a presupposed baseline. The mathematical claim about \u2018finite / infinity = 0%\u2019 is correct, and the critique is clear, focused, and has little extraneous material.",
