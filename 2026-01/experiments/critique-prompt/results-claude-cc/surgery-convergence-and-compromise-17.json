  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real, load-bearing sub-claim in the essay\u2019s anti-WAM-convergence argument under moral realism: that increased \u201cdistance/alienness\u201d from current preferences makes de dicto moral motivation less likely. If that link were reversed or even substantially weakened, the essay\u2019s pessimism about the realism case would be less supported, though the overall position wouldn\u2019t collapse because the essay also argues from (i) externalism/internalism complications, (ii) anti-realism leading to divergence, (iii) blockers/lock-in, and (iv) threats and bargaining issues. Hence moderate centrality.\n\nAs an objection it has some force: history does provide examples where unfamiliar/transcendent doctrines motivate large sacrifices, so the essay arguably should have considered the possibility that \u201calien\u201d moral truth could be motivationally compelling. But it doesn\u2019t strongly refute the attacked claim because it gives only a plausibility argument and analogy, not reasons to expect this effect to dominate in the relevant setting (post-AGI reflection, varied agents, potential strategic avoidance of motivating beliefs, etc.). It also doesn\u2019t engage the essay\u2019s specific mechanisms (e.g., people choosing not to learn/endorse motivating moral facts under internalism, or believing but not acting under externalism), so it weakens rather than overturns.\n\nMost statements are broadly reasonable (alienness can sometimes increase motivation; religious movements are evidence), but the implied general reversal (\u201calienness might increase motivation rather than decrease it\u201d) is not established as typical, only as possible, so correctness is good but not perfect. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
