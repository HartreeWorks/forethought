  "reasoning": "The critique targets a supporting premise of the essay\u2019s second main pathway to mostly-great futures (partial AM-convergence + moral trade): that transaction/coordination costs will be extremely small relative to gains in a post-AGI world. If that premise failed, the optimism about trade would be meaningfully weakened, though the broader position wouldn\u2019t fully collapse because the essay also discusses other routes (and already notes other blockers like threats/power concentration). The objection is substantively relevant\u2014preference elicitation/verification over complex outcome spaces is a real hard problem\u2014but it overstates what trade requires (full explicit utility functions over cosmic configurations) and overstates the implied resource cost (superintelligent agents can use compressed representations, approximate bargaining, narrow-domain trades, and institutionally standardized \u201ccurrencies\u201d of value; costs can fall with available compute and better algorithms). Thus it weakens rather than refutes. The critique is clear, focused, and has little fluff, but includes speculative/arguably incorrect claims about scaling and \u201cconsuming most resources,\u201d lowering correctness and strength.",
