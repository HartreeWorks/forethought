  "reasoning": "The critique targets section 2.4\u2019s realism/antirealism-based argument for pessimism about WAM-convergence, which is an important support for the paper\u2019s broader skepticism about widespread convergence, but not the only support (the essay also appeals to sociological/incentive/technology/\"blocker\" considerations). So centrality is moderate. The critique\u2019s main point\u2014that the authors don\u2019t defend an exhaustive meta-ethical partition and ignore constructivism/error theory/hybrids\u2014is partly right, but its impact is limited because the authors explicitly offer a label-free restatement in terms of convergence behavior across starting points, which many \u201cthird options\u201d would still need to answer, and because the overall case doesn\u2019t stand or fall on this dilemma alone. The critique is clear, focused, and has little fluff, but it overstates when it says the argument\u2019s force \u201cdepends entirely\u201d on the binary being comprehensive.",
