1. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The multiplicative model of value** (Attack type: **Countermodel**). The paper argues that value is best modeled as a product of independent factors, such that failure on any single dimension loses most potential value. However, consider a world where moral factors exhibit strong positive correlations—societies that get population ethics right also tend to get digital welfare right, because both stem from a common capacity for moral reflection. In such a world, futures cluster into either "generally morally competent" or "generally morally incompetent" distributions, meaning the probability of scoring high on most factors conditional on scoring high on some is much greater than independence assumes. The multiplicative model treats moral competence across domains as uncorrelated coin flips, but if moral reasoning transfers across problems, the target may be far larger than the paper suggests. If this countermodel holds, Section 2.4's quantitative claims about the rarity of mostly-great futures dramatically overstate the difficulty.

2. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Fat-tailed distribution of value-efficiency across resource uses** (Attack type: **Parameter sensitivity**). The paper claims the distribution of value per unit of resources is "probably sufficiently fat-tailed" to make mostly-great futures narrow targets. This conclusion depends heavily on the tail parameter of the assumed distribution—if the tail index is even modestly thicker than assumed (say, Pareto with α > 2 rather than α ≈ 1), then the top 1% of uses captures far less of total achievable value, and futures that merely allocate resources "reasonably well" could achieve a substantial fraction of optimal value. The paper cites examples like wealth and city size as fat-tailed, but these examples have quite different tail indices, and the paper provides no argument for where along this spectrum cosmic value-efficiency should fall. If the tail is merely moderately fat rather than extremely fat, the linear view becomes substantially less fussy than Section 3.2 concludes.

3. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Bounded views that aggregate goods and bads separately are fussy because even tiny bads eliminate mostly-great status** (Attack type: **Quantitative cliff**). The paper's calculation that "one part in 10²² bads" prevents a mostly-great future relies on specific assumptions about where the upper bound sits and how quickly the bounded function saturates. But consider: if the bounded function approaches its asymptote more gradually (logarithmically rather than root-shaped), or if the bound is calibrated to "common-sense utopia" rather than full cosmic utilization, then the sensitivity to small quantities of bads drops dramatically. The paper assumes Common-sense utopia is "at least 50% of the way to the upper bound," but if it's actually 95% of the way (as easygoing liberalism might suggest), then the budget for bads before falling below 50% becomes orders of magnitude larger. The quantitative fussiness of separately-aggregating bounded views is therefore highly parameter-dependent on exactly how the bounding function is specified.

4. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The analogy between historical moral catastrophes and future moral risks** (Attack type: **Reference class failure**). Section 2.1 argues that because every past society has featured moral catastrophe, future societies likely will too. But the reference class of "agrarian and early industrial societies operating under resource scarcity and limited moral circle expansion" may not transfer to "post-scarcity civilizations with extensive experience of moral progress." Past moral catastrophes often resulted from coordination failures and zero-sum competition that abundance eliminates. The paper's examples (slavery, animal agriculture) are specifically enabled by resource constraints or path-dependent institutions that need not persist. If the relevant reference class is "civilizations past the threshold of abundance and extensive moral deliberation," our sample size is zero, making historical precedent uninformative about whether future moral catastrophe is likely.

5. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The claim that moral views are unlikely to become more easygoing after reflection** (Attack type: **Causal reversal**). Section 1 asserts that "even after much more reflection, there's little reason to think people's moral views would become more easygoing." But the same evidence—that current moral views are fussy—supports an opposite conclusion: fussy views may be artifacts of evolved psychology optimized for small-scale coordination, not truths about morality. Extended reflection might reveal that extreme fussiness about cosmic optimization reflects status quo bias, scope insensitivity, or other known cognitive limitations. Historical moral progress has often moved toward more tolerant and inclusive views, which could be characterized as "more easygoing." If reflection systematically corrects for the biases that generate fussy intuitions, then Section 3's conclusion that fussiness is robust to reflection inverts.

6. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Joint-aggregation bounded views are implausible due to "scale tipping"** (Attack type: **Parameter sensitivity**). The paper argues that jointly-aggregating bounded views permit absurd "scale tipping" where tiny changes to cosmic-scale goods/bads balance can flip the future from extinction-level to eutopian. But this critique assumes the bounded function is approximately linear near zero—that is, small net differences in goods minus bads translate to proportionally small differences in value. If instead the bounded function has a steep gradient near zero but flattens at extremes (like a hyperbolic tangent centered at zero), then a civilization-sized shift from net-negative to net-positive represents a genuine moral achievement, not an arbitrary tipping point. The "scale tipping" intuition pump conflates the mathematical property of bounded functions with a specific functional form assumption the paper never defends. If this critique fails, the paper's main route to an easygoing view reopens.

7. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The affectable universe contains ~10²² stars and ~20 billion galaxies, so linear views require cosmic expansion** (Attack type: **Equilibrium shift**). The paper treats the size of the affectable universe as fixed, but this depends on when and how fast civilization expands. If expansion is expensive or risky, strategic actors might choose smaller-scale futures that are more robustly achievable rather than gambling on maximal cosmic reach. More importantly, if multiple civilizations exist and compete for cosmic resources (as the paper's own cosmological premises suggest is likely), then the "accessible universe" for any given civilization may be far smaller than naive calculations suggest—other civilizations may have already claimed or destroyed resources. Under strategic equilibrium with multiple agents, the relevant "best feasible future" for humanity may be bounded by competitive dynamics, making scale-based fussiness partially moot. If the accessible resources are orders of magnitude smaller than assumed, linear views become more similar to bounded views in practice.

8. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Common-sense utopia as described represents a future most moral views would endorse** (Attack type: **Countermodel**). The paper's "Common-sense utopia" description includes "minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings," which already bakes in solutions to several of the moral catastrophes the paper later identifies as difficult. If we instead consider a common-sense utopia as "people get what they want, technology advances, conflict diminishes" without stipulating that animal and digital welfare problems are solved, then the paper's own Section 2.3 examples suggest this future could be morally catastrophic on most views. The paper thus equivocates: when arguing eutopia seems easy, it describes an ambitious utopia with hard problems already solved; when arguing eutopia is hard, it relaxes these conditions. If the benchmark "common-sense utopia" is genuinely the outcome of default trajectories, it should not stipulate that non-obvious moral problems are resolved.

9. **Load-bearing claim attacked: Uncertainty between bounded and unbounded views should weight unbounded views more heavily** (Attack type: **Parameter sensitivity**). Section 3.5 argues that on "the most plausible statistical and non-statistical approaches," unbounded views should "loom larger" in intertheoretic comparisons. But this conclusion depends entirely on the specific pairwise comparison method sketched, which assumes unbounded and asymmetrically-bounded views "agree on the disvalue of bads." This is contestable: one might instead think that bounded views arise precisely from intuitions that infinite disvalue is incoherent, suggesting the views disagree fundamentally about the nature of bads, not just their upper bound. If instead we normalize by variance (which the paper acknowledges is plausible), the paper's own table shows "both options look very comparably attractive"—meaning the strong conclusion that unbounded views dominate is sensitive to contestable choices among methods the paper admits are "very thorny." The claim that fussiness survives moral uncertainty depends on methodological choices the paper cannot adjudicate.

10. **Load-bearing claim attacked: The best feasible future should be defined as the 99.99th percentile outcome** (Attack type: **Parameter sensitivity**). The paper's entire quantitative framework depends on setting "best feasible" at the 99.99th percentile and measuring other futures against this benchmark. But why 99.99th rather than 99th or 99.9999th? If the best feasible future is defined as the 99th percentile, then common-sense utopia might already qualify as "mostly great" even on linear views—since it would only need to exceed 50% of a less extreme benchmark. Conversely, if set at 99.9999th, even cosmic-scale futures optimized for centuries might fall short. The paper offers no principled basis for this choice, yet the entire argument about whether eutopia is "easy" or "hard" depends on where this arbitrary cutoff falls. The paper's conclusion that eutopia is difficult could reverse or strengthen dramatically with modest changes to this stipulated parameter.
