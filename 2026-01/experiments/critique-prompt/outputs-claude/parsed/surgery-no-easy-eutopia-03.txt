> The fussiness result hinges on how fast the bounding function saturates—a more gradual curve or a higher calibration point for "common-sense utopia" would tolerate orders of magnitude more bads.

**Load-bearing claim:**
Bounded views that aggregate goods and bads separately are fussy because even tiny bads eliminate mostly-great status

**Attack type:**
Quantitative cliff

The paper's calculation that "one part in 10²² bads" prevents a mostly-great future relies on specific assumptions about where the upper bound sits and how quickly the bounded function saturates. But consider: if the bounded function approaches its asymptote more gradually (logarithmically rather than root-shaped), or if the bound is calibrated to "common-sense utopia" rather than full cosmic utilization, then the sensitivity to small quantities of bads drops dramatically. The paper assumes Common-sense utopia is "at least 50% of the way to the upper bound," but if it's actually 95% of the way (as easygoing liberalism might suggest), then the budget for bads before falling below 50% becomes orders of magnitude larger. The quantitative fussiness of separately-aggregating bounded views is therefore highly parameter-dependent on exactly how the bounding function is specified.
