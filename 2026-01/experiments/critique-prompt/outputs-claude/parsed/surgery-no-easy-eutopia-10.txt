> Shifting the "best feasible" benchmark even slightly—from the 99th to the 99.9999th percentile—could flip the paper's conclusion about whether eutopia is hard or easy.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The best feasible future should be defined as the 99.99th percentile outcome

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

The paper's entire quantitative framework depends on setting "best feasible" at the 99.99th percentile and measuring other futures against this benchmark. But why 99.99th rather than 99th or 99.9999th? If the best feasible future is defined as the 99th percentile, then common-sense utopia might already qualify as "mostly great" even on linear views—since it would only need to exceed 50% of a less extreme benchmark. Conversely, if set at 99.9999th, even cosmic-scale futures optimized for centuries might fall short. The paper offers no principled basis for this choice, yet the entire argument about whether eutopia is "easy" or "hard" depends on where this arbitrary cutoff falls. The paper's conclusion that eutopia is difficult could reverse or strengthen dramatically with modest changes to this stipulated parameter.
