**Load-bearing claim:**
Fat-tailed distribution of value-efficiency across resource uses

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

The paper claims the distribution of value per unit of resources is "probably sufficiently fat-tailed" to make mostly-great futures narrow targets. This conclusion depends heavily on the tail parameter of the assumed distribution—if the tail index is even modestly thicker than assumed (say, Pareto with α > 2 rather than α ≈ 1), then the top 1% of uses captures far less of total achievable value, and futures that merely allocate resources "reasonably well" could achieve a substantial fraction of optimal value. The paper cites examples like wealth and city size as fat-tailed, but these examples have quite different tail indices, and the paper provides no argument for where along this spectrum cosmic value-efficiency should fall. If the tail is merely moderately fat rather than extremely fat, the linear view becomes substantially less fussy than Section 3.2 concludes.
