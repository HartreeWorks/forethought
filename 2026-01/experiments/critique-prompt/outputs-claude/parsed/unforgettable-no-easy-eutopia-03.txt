"The Bounded-Asymmetric Domino Problem" challenges the paper's treatment of bounded views that aggregate goods and bads separately (Section 3.3). The paper argues such views are fussy because even one part in 10²² of bads destroys eutopia. But this proves too much: if any non-zero bads prevent a mostly-great future, then *every physically possible future* fails to be mostly-great, since thermodynamic constraints guarantee some suffering somewhere. The paper's criterion doesn't distinguish between achievable futures at all—it makes the entire category of "mostly-great futures" empty by physical necessity. This isn't fussiness; it's vacuity. If the objection holds, the paper must either abandon separate aggregation views or provide a threshold for bads that's achievable rather than mathematically zero.
