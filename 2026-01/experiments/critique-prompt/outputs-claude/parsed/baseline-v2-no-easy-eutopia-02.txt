"The Multiplicative Model Assumption" — The paper argues that value is best modeled as the product of many independent factors, such that failure on any single dimension catastrophically reduces overall value. This multiplicative model is presented with a toy example of uniform distributions, but the paper provides no compelling argument for why value should be multiplicative rather than, say, additive with diminishing marginal returns on each dimension. The wealth analogy offered is suggestive but not dispositive—wealth may be multiplicatively determined while value is not. If value is actually subadditive or exhibits complex interactions between dimensions, the conclusion about eutopian fragility could be substantially weakened or reversed.
