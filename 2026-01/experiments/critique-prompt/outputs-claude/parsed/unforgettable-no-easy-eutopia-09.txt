"The Extinction Stipulation Is Doing Hidden Work" attacks the paper's definitional choice that extinction has value 0 (Section 3.1). This stipulation makes extinction better than any negative-value future and worse than any positive-value future—a substantive ethical claim, not a harmless normalization. Many views (Buddhist, antinatalist, some environmentalist) would assign extinction positive value; many religious views would assign it negative value. By stipulating extinction = 0, the paper excludes views where humanity's absence is intrinsically good, which are precisely the views most likely to be easygoing about futures that don't maximize human-controlled value. The entire fussiness analysis is conditional on a particular ranking of extinction that already excludes the most plausible easygoing alternatives.
