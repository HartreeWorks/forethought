[The Resource Economist] The paper's cost-benefit comparisons between different futures assume that "resources in the accessible universe" can be meaningfully allocated toward arbitrary ends, but never specifies what conversion rate connects physical resources to moral outcomes. The authors claim that "the distribution of value/cost, over likely uses of those resources, is probably sufficiently fat-tailed" based on analogies to consumer goods and health interventions, but these domains have well-defined production functions that don't exist for their proposed moral goods. Converting a star system's worth of matter into "digital welfare" versus "flourishing biological lives" versus "aesthetic experiences" requires technologies that don't exist and may have wildly different efficiency curves—or may be physically impossible. The entire framework of "value-efficient arrangements of resources" treats moral optimization as engineering problem with known constraints, when in fact we have no idea what the production possibility frontier for cosmic-scale wellbeing looks like. Their quantitative conclusions about how much value is "lost" to various moral errors are therefore not wrong but meaningless—denominated in units that cannot be measured or traded.
