"The Bounded-Unbounded Dichotomy Oversimplification" — The paper's taxonomy treats boundedness as a binary property, but many plausible moral views might be better characterized as having context-dependent or threshold-based structures that don't fit neatly into either category. For instance, a view might be approximately linear up to some very large scale, then exhibit bounded behavior—or might treat different types of value (happiness, knowledge, relationships) with different bounding structures. The paper's systematic analysis depends on views falling cleanly into its categories, but many reasonable moral perspectives may resist such classification, limiting the scope of the paper's conclusions.
