"The Common-Sense Utopia Stipulation Problem" — The paper's argument depends heavily on treating "Common-sense utopia" as a benchmark, stipulating it involves "100 billion people" living "wonderfully happy" lives with various freedoms. However, this description is vague enough to encompass vastly different scenarios, some of which might already constitute near-best futures on many views and some of which might not. The paper uses this single underspecified scenario to derive conclusions about whether bounded views treat it as 80% of maximal value, but different specifications of the scenario could dramatically change these assessments. The argument would be strengthened by considering a range of more precisely specified scenarios.
