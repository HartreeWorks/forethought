"The Hedonic Treadmill Analogy Weakness" — The paper uses the hedonic treadmill as a psychological explanation for why we might underestimate the difficulty of achieving eutopia, suggesting our expectations reset after achieving goods. However, this analogy cuts both ways: if our psychological tendency is to perpetually see eutopia as "just out of reach," this could be a bias causing us to overestimate how much better things could be, rather than underestimate it. The paper assumes without argument that the treadmill effect leads us to underestimate the gap, but the same psychological mechanism could mean our idealized conceptions of "best feasible futures" are themselves inflated beyond what's genuinely achievable or even coherent.
