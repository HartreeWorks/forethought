[The Institutional Corruptionist] The paper assumes that if "some people have the right view and compromise between them and the rest of society is sufficient," this could steer toward eutopia—but this ignores how deliberative processes are systematically captured by concentrated interests. The authors acknowledge that resource allocation during space settlement could "end up concentrated among a tiny number of hands," yet treat this as merely one possible moral error rather than the predictable outcome of any institutional arrangement. Historical precedent from colonial resource extraction, spectrum auctions, and carbon markets shows that nominally neutral allocation mechanisms are reliably captured by whoever has the most resources at the time of implementation. The paper's entire framework of "convergence and compromise" as a path to eutopia therefore rests on institutional assumptions that have never held in practice when stakes were high—the very actors best positioned to influence "truth-seeking deliberative processes" are those with the most to gain from non-eutopian outcomes.
