**Load-bearing claim attacked: Common-sense utopia as described represents a future most moral views would endorse** (Attack type: **Countermodel**). The paper's "Common-sense utopia" description includes "minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings," which already bakes in solutions to several of the moral catastrophes the paper later identifies as difficult. If we instead consider a common-sense utopia as "people get what they want, technology advances, conflict diminishes" without stipulating that animal and digital welfare problems are solved, then the paper's own Section 2.3 examples suggest this future could be morally catastrophic on most views. The paper thus equivocates: when arguing eutopia seems easy, it describes an ambitious utopia with hard problems already solved; when arguing eutopia is hard, it relaxes these conditions. If the benchmark "common-sense utopia" is genuinely the outcome of default trajectories, it should not stipulate that non-obvious moral problems are resolved.
