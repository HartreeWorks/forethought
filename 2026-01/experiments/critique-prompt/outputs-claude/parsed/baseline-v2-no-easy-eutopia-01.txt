"The Arbitrary Normalization Problem" — The paper stipulates that guaranteed best feasible futures have a value of 1 and guaranteed extinction has a value of 0, treating this as a neutral methodological choice. However, this normalization itself embeds significant assumptions about how to compare outcomes across different moral views. The paper acknowledges that "there are endlessly many ways to numerically represent a given value function," yet proceeds to build substantial arguments on a particular normalization. This is problematic because the very question of whether eutopia is "easy" or "hard" depends on where we set these benchmarks. Different normalizations could yield radically different conclusions about what fraction of possible futures count as "mostly-great," undermining the paper's central claims about the narrowness of the target.
