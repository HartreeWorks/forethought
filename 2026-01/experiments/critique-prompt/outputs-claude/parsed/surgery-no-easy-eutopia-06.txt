**Load-bearing claim:**
Joint-aggregation bounded views are implausible due to "scale tipping"

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

The paper argues that jointly-aggregating bounded views permit absurd "scale tipping" where tiny changes to cosmic-scale goods/bads balance can flip the future from extinction-level to eutopian. But this critique assumes the bounded function is approximately linear near zero—that is, small net differences in goods minus bads translate to proportionally small differences in value. If instead the bounded function has a steep gradient near zero but flattens at extremes (like a hyperbolic tangent centered at zero), then a civilization-sized shift from net-negative to net-positive represents a genuine moral achievement, not an arbitrary tipping point. The "scale tipping" intuition pump conflates the mathematical property of bounded functions with a specific functional form assumption the paper never defends. If this critique fails, the paper's main route to an easygoing view reopens.
