[The Moral Parliament Dissenter] The paper assumes that moral views can be meaningfully aggregated through von Neumann-Morgenstern utility representations, but this smuggles in consequentialist assumptions that many moral frameworks explicitly reject. Deontological views that treat certain actions as absolutely prohibited cannot be captured by any continuous value function over outcomes—the wrongness of torturing one person isn't diminished by any amount of happiness elsewhere in the distribution. The authors claim their framework doesn't "restrict us to consequentialist views," but their entire apparatus of "quantities of value" defined by willingness to accept gambles presupposes that outcomes can be traded off against each other at some rate. When they discuss "moral uncertainty" between bounded and unbounded views, they're not actually comparing moral theories—they're comparing consequentialist cousins while excluding the deontological and virtue-theoretic frameworks that would reject the gamble-based methodology entirely. The paper's conclusion that "most plausible moral views are fussy" is therefore circular: they've defined "plausible" to exclude views incompatible with their aggregation procedure.
