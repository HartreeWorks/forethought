"The Fat-Tailed Value Distribution is Self-Refuting" targets the claim that the distribution of value-per-resource is fat-tailed, making near-optimal resource use astronomically unlikely (Section 3.2). The paper invokes fat-tailed distributions in citations, subjective experience, and economic value as evidence. But the very same fat-tailed logic applies to *our probability distribution over moral theories*: a fat-tailed distribution over theories means we should expect the true theory to be one we haven't even conceived of yet, and that theory could easily be easygoing. The paper's own reasoning about expecting extremes undermines confidence in any particular fussy theory. If the authors accept fat tails generally, they cannot assume the true theory resembles any theory they've analyzed. The paper would need to explain why fat-tailed logic applies to value distributions but not to moral uncertainty itself.
