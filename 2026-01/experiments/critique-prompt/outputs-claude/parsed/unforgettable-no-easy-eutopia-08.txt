"The Resource-Control Assumption Begs the Question" challenges the inference that linear unbounded views require controlling "most accessible resources" for a mostly-great future. The paper assumes that resources not under human control contribute nothing (or random value) to overall goodness. But many moral views—especially those concerned with naturalness, wild animal welfare, or the intrinsic value of unmanaged ecosystems—would evaluate resources *better* when left alone. On such views, humanity controlling all 10²² stars would be a moral catastrophe, not a requirement for eutopia. The paper treats "resources under civilization's control" as a proxy for "resources contributing to value," but this is precisely what's contested. If control isn't instrumentally necessary for value on many views, the linear-views-require-scale argument collapses.
