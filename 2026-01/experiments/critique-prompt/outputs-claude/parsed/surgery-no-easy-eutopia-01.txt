> If moral competence transfers across domains, getting one ethical question right makes getting others right far more likely, so the "target" of a good future is much larger than independent coin flips suggest.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The multiplicative model of value

**Attack type:**
Countermodel

The paper argues that value is best modeled as a product of independent factors, such that failure on any single dimension loses most potential value. However, consider a world where moral factors exhibit strong positive correlations—societies that get population ethics right also tend to get digital welfare right, because both stem from a common capacity for moral reflection. In such a world, futures cluster into either "generally morally competent" or "generally morally incompetent" distributions, meaning the probability of scoring high on most factors conditional on scoring high on some is much greater than independence assumes. The multiplicative model treats moral competence across domains as uncorrelated coin flips, but if moral reasoning transfers across problems, the target may be far larger than the paper suggests. If this countermodel holds, Section 2.4's quantitative claims about the rarity of mostly-great futures dramatically overstate the difficulty.
