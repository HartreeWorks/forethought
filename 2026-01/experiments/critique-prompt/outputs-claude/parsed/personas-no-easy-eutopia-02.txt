The paper treats future resource allocation decisions as if they will be made by unified agents pursuing coherent value functions, but ignores that any actual space settlement regime will involve strategic actors who can defect from cooperative agreements. When the authors discuss "initial periods of settlement and resource appropriation," they fail to recognize that first-mover advantages in capturing extrasolar resources create overwhelming incentives for racing behavior—whoever moves fastest gains near-permanent control, regardless of what allocation system society ostensibly endorses. The "compromise" mechanisms proposed in the companion essay cannot bind actors who can unilaterally claim resources before negotiations conclude. This means the paper's framing of moral catastrophe as stemming from "wrong views" misdiagnoses the problem: even if everyone holds correct views about ideal allocation, the game-theoretic structure ensures defection, making their entire framework of convergence toward correct moral views decision-theoretically naive.
