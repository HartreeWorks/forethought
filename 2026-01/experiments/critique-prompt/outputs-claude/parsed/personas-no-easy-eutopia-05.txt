[The Complexity Theorist] The paper's multiplicative model of value assumes that factors like "population ethics," "digital welfare," and "attitudes to wellbeing" are independent dimensions that can be scored separately and then combined. But in any actual future civilization, these factors will interact in complex, nonlinear ways that make the product decomposition meaningless. Attitudes toward digital beings will shape population ethics through replacement fertility effects; wellbeing theories will determine which beings count in population calculus; resource allocation will constrain which wellbeing theories are even implementable. The authors treat these as separate "mistakes" that each independently erase value, but emergent properties of complex systems mean that getting one factor "right" may be impossible without simultaneously addressing others—or that apparent solutions on one dimension create cascading failures elsewhere. Their framework cannot model path dependencies, feedback loops, or phase transitions in social values, making their probability estimates over "mostly-great futures" systematically overconfident about the decomposability of the target.
