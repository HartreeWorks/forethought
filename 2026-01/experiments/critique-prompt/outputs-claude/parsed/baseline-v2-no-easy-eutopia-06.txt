"The Counterexample Problem for Linear Views" — The paper argues that linear unbounded views require "most available resources" to be configured for "almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing." However, this seems to contradict ordinary moral intuitions that many different arrangements of flourishing lives could be equally valuable. If a linear view holds that a happy life spent gardening is equally valuable per unit resource as a happy life spent composing music, then there would be enormous flexibility in achieving mostly-great futures. The paper assumes without adequate justification that linear views must favor a single hyper-specific configuration of resources rather than treating many different valuable arrangements as roughly equivalent.
