> Post-scarcity civilisations with extensive moral deliberation experience may be a fundamentally different reference class from historical societies, making past moral catastrophes uninformative about future risk.

**Load-bearing claim:**
The analogy between historical moral catastrophes and future moral risks

**Attack type:**
Reference class failure

Section 2.1 argues that because every past society has featured moral catastrophe, future societies likely will too. But the reference class of "agrarian and early industrial societies operating under resource scarcity and limited moral circle expansion" may not transfer to "post-scarcity civilizations with extensive experience of moral progress." Past moral catastrophes often resulted from coordination failures and zero-sum competition that abundance eliminates. The paper's examples (slavery, animal agriculture) are specifically enabled by resource constraints or path-dependent institutions that need not persist. If the relevant reference class is "civilizations past the threshold of abundance and extensive moral deliberation," our sample size is zero, making historical precedent uninformative about whether future moral catastrophe is likely.
