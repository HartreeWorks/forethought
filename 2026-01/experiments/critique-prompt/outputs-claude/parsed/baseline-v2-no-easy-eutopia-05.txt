"The Fat-Tailed Distribution Claim" — The paper asserts that the distribution of value-per-unit-resources is "probably sufficiently fat-tailed" to make achieving mostly-great futures extremely difficult. The empirical evidence cited (wealth distribution, city sizes, citations) pertains to instrumental goods in competitive environments, not intrinsic value. The paper provides no mechanism explaining why intrinsic value should follow similar distributions. Moreover, the claim that uncertainty about fat-tailed distributions makes expected distributions fat-tailed is a mathematical non-sequitur—mixing thin-tailed and fat-tailed distributions with positive probability on each does not necessarily yield a fat-tailed expected distribution, depending on the mixing weights and specific distributions involved.
