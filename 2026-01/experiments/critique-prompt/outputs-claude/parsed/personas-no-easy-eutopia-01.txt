The paper's central claim that "mostly-great futures" require achieving at least 50% of the value difference between extinction and eutopia rests entirely on stipulated definitions without any identified causal mechanism for why value would actually aggregate multiplicatively across independent dimensions. The authors assert that factors like population ethics, digital welfare, and resource allocation combine as products rather than sums, but provide no empirical evidence that moral value actually compounds this way rather than adding linearly or following some other functional form. Without a falsifiable prediction about how we could detect whether value is multiplicative versus additive in real-world moral assessments, this is metaphysical speculation dressed as analysis. The concrete consequence is that the entire "narrow target" conclusion could collapse if value aggregates differently—for instance, if doing well on 4 of 5 dimensions yields 80% of maximum value rather than the 6% their multiplicative model implies.
