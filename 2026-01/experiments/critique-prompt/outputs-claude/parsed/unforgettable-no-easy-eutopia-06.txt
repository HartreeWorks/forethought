"The Hedonism-Treadmill Analogy Cuts Both Ways" undermines the psychological debunking argument in Section 2.5. The paper argues that hedonic adaptation explains why eutopia always seems just out of reach—our expectations reset, so we're biased toward thinking the target is close when it isn't. But the same psychological mechanism generates the opposite prediction: after extensive reflection, each newly discovered "flaw" would feel maximally important precisely because it's the current frontier, while previously discovered flaws would fade in apparent significance. Hedonic treadmills don't systematically bias us toward *under*estimating distance to targets; they bias us toward treating current position as neutral. If anything, this suggests we systematically *overweight* the most recently discovered moral concern. The debunking argument could support either conclusion, so it supports neither.
