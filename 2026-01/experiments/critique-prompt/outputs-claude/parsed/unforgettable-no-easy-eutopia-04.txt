"The Navigation Metaphor Undermines the Argument" exposes a tension between the paper's framing and its conclusion. The authors use the sailing-to-an-island metaphor to set up three factors: island size, navigation, and multiple attempts. They announce they'll address only factor (1), the island's size. But the entire Section 2.3 list of "future catastrophes" is actually about failures of *navigation*—wrong population ethics, wrong wellbeing theory, wrong discount rates. These aren't features of the target; they're ways the crew could aim wrong. The paper's evidence for a narrow target is actually evidence that navigation is hard, which they explicitly bracket. If this confusion is corrected, the paper has much less to say about target size than it claims, and the sequel essay on convergence must bear far more argumentative weight.
