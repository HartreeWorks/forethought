"The Intertheoretic Comparison Retreat" — After presenting an elaborate analysis of how different normalization methods yield different recommendations, the paper retreats to saying "Intertheoretic comparisons are very thorny, so we don't want to push any strong conclusions." This undermines the paper's overall argument because the question of whether eutopia is "easy" or "hard" is precisely a question about how to weight different moral considerations. If we cannot make confident intertheoretic comparisons, we cannot confidently assert that "most plausible moral views are fussy." The paper's systematic analysis in Section 3 loses much of its persuasive force if the meta-ethical framework for combining these analyses remains unresolved.
