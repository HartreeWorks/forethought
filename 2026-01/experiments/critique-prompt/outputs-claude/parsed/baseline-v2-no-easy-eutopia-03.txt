"The Scope Sensitivity Dilemma" — The paper simultaneously appeals to scope sensitivity (arguing linear views require galaxy-scale futures to be mostly-great) and dismisses it (treating common-sense utopia confined to our solar system as potentially mostly-great on bounded views). This creates an internal tension: if we should be scope-sensitive, then bounded views that treat common-sense utopia as 80% of maximal value seem to radically underweight the cosmic scale of potential futures. But if we shouldn't be scope-sensitive, then the paper's criticism of linear views for being "fussy" about scale loses much of its force. The paper never adequately resolves when scope sensitivity is appropriate and when it isn't.
