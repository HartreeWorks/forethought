The paper's claim that humanity could "squander" its opportunity for a near-best future mirrors the exact reasoning structure of 19th-century utilitarian reformers who believed that material abundance plus correct moral education would automatically produce optimal social arrangements. The Benthamite program assumed that once scarcity was overcome and correct views disseminated, society would converge on happiness-maximizing institutions—yet industrial abundance actually enabled new forms of exploitation, alienation, and warfare that pre-industrial reformers couldn't anticipate. Similarly, the Soviet experiment assumed that eliminating capitalist property relations would allow humanity to achieve a near-best future through correct social organization, yet produced outcomes that most moral frameworks would classify as catastrophic. The paper provides no account of why their framework of "moral convergence plus compromise" would succeed where structurally identical reasoning repeatedly failed, suggesting their confidence in deliberative solutions reflects philosophical naivety about how large-scale social optimization actually unfolds.
