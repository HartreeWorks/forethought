"The Multiplicative Model Smuggles In What It Purports to Discover" attacks the paper's core inference that value is well-modeled as a product of independent factors (Section 2.4). The authors present the multiplicative model as a *discovery* about why eutopia is fragile, but the model itself presupposes that single dimensions can zero out overall value—which is precisely the "no easy eutopia" conclusion. A model where value is the *weighted average* of factors (or where factors have diminishing marginal returns at low scores) would generate the opposite conclusion from identical inputs. The paper provides no principled argument for why multiplication rather than averaging better captures moral reality; it simply observes that multiplication produces the result they want. If this objection holds, the paper needs to justify why multiplicative aggregation is the correct functional form—not merely illustrate that it generates fragility.
