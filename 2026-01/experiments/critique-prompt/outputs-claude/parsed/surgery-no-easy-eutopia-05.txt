**Load-bearing claim:**
The claim that moral views are unlikely to become more easygoing after reflection

**Attack type:**
Causal reversal

Section 1 asserts that "even after much more reflection, there's little reason to think people's moral views would become more easygoing." But the same evidence—that current moral views are fussy—supports an opposite conclusion: fussy views may be artifacts of evolved psychology optimized for small-scale coordination, not truths about morality. Extended reflection might reveal that extreme fussiness about cosmic optimization reflects status quo bias, scope insensitivity, or other known cognitive limitations. Historical moral progress has often moved toward more tolerant and inclusive views, which could be characterized as "more easygoing." If reflection systematically corrects for the biases that generate fussy intuitions, then Section 3's conclusion that fussiness is robust to reflection inverts.
