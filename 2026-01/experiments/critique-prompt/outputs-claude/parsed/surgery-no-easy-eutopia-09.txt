**Load-bearing claim:**
Uncertainty between bounded and unbounded views should weight unbounded views more heavily

**Attack type:**
Parameter sensitivity

Section 3.5 argues that on "the most plausible statistical and non-statistical approaches," unbounded views should "loom larger" in intertheoretic comparisons. But this conclusion depends entirely on the specific pairwise comparison method sketched, which assumes unbounded and asymmetrically-bounded views "agree on the disvalue of bads." This is contestable: one might instead think that bounded views arise precisely from intuitions that infinite disvalue is incoherent, suggesting the views disagree fundamentally about the nature of bads, not just their upper bound. If instead we normalize by variance (which the paper acknowledges is plausible), the paper's own table shows "both options look very comparably attractive"—meaning the strong conclusion that unbounded views dominate is sensitive to contestable choices among methods the paper admits are "very thorny." The claim that fussiness survives moral uncertainty depends on methodological choices the paper cannot adjudicate.
