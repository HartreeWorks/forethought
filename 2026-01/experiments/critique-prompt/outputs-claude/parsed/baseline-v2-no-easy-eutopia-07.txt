"The Digital Beings Moral Catastrophe Ambiguity" — The paper lists potential moral catastrophes involving digital beings, including both giving them too few rights and giving them too many (leading to loss of human control). This creates an unfalsifiable setup where almost any outcome regarding digital beings can be characterized as a potential catastrophe depending on one's moral premises. The paper never establishes criteria for identifying which of these conflicting concerns should take priority, or how to weigh them against each other. Without such criteria, the examples serve more as illustrations that someone could always find something to worry about, rather than as evidence that mostly-great futures are genuinely narrow targets.
