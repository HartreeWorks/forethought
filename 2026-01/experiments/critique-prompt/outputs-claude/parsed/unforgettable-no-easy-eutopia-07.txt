"The Intertheoretic Comparison Shell Game" attacks the moral uncertainty analysis in Section 3.5. The paper walks through multiple normalization methods, shows they yield different recommendations, then tentatively endorses the "pairwise" approach that makes unbounded views loom largest. But the pairwise approach requires direct judgments about how views compare—for instance, that utilitarianism and strict negative utilitarianism "agree on the disvalue of bads." This is false: utilitarians think 1 unit of suffering trades against 1 unit of pleasure, while strict negative utilitarians think no amount of pleasure compensates any suffering. The "agreement" is fabricated by stipulating the comparison the authors want. The paper's conclusion that "unbounded views should effectively loom larger" rests entirely on this manufactured intertheoretic bridge.
