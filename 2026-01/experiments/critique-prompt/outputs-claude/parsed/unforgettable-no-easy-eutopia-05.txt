"The Common-Sense Utopia Benchmark Is Gerrymandered" attacks the paper's choice of reference point for evaluating fussiness. The paper defines common-sense utopia (Section 2.2) as 100 billion happy people with freedom, diversity, and minimal suffering—then argues most views wouldn't count this as mostly-great. But this benchmark is carefully selected to fail on *scale-sensitive* views (only 100 billion people, only possible future civilization) while passing on *easygoing liberal* views. A different "common-sense utopia" featuring a trillion galaxies of moderately good lives would reverse which views are fussy. The paper's conclusion that "most views are fussy" depends entirely on benchmarking against a deliberately small-scale scenario. The paper needs to justify why this particular benchmark reveals something general rather than being constructed to produce the desired result.
