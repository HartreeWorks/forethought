**Load-bearing claim:**
The affectable universe contains ~10²² stars and ~20 billion galaxies, so linear views require cosmic expansion

**Attack type:**
Equilibrium shift

The paper treats the size of the affectable universe as fixed, but this depends on when and how fast civilization expands. If expansion is expensive or risky, strategic actors might choose smaller-scale futures that are more robustly achievable rather than gambling on maximal cosmic reach. More importantly, if multiple civilizations exist and compete for cosmic resources (as the paper's own cosmological premises suggest is likely), then the "accessible universe" for any given civilization may be far smaller than naive calculations suggest—other civilizations may have already claimed or destroyed resources. Under strategic equilibrium with multiple agents, the relevant "best feasible future" for humanity may be bounded by competitive dynamics, making scale-based fussiness partially moot. If the accessible resources are orders of magnitude smaller than assumed, linear views become more similar to bounded views in practice.
