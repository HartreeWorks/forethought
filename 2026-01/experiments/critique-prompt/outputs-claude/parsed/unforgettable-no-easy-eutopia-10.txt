"The 90%/50% Thresholds Are Arbitrarily Punitive" targets the paper's definitions of eutopia (>90% of best feasible value) and mostly-great (>50%). The paper acknowledges "there's nothing magical about the mostly-great threshold" but then builds its entire argument around showing most views make these thresholds hard to reach. But at any non-arbitrary threshold, *some* views will make it easy and others hard—that's what having a threshold means. The paper's conclusions are artifacts of threshold choice: at 10%, most views would be easygoing; at 99.9%, virtually all views would be fussy. The interesting empirical question—what fraction of futures most views would endorse as "good enough"—cannot be answered by stipulating numeric cutoffs. If the thresholds were derived from something principled (decision-relevant indifference points, revealed preferences under uncertainty), this objection dissolves, but no such derivation appears.
