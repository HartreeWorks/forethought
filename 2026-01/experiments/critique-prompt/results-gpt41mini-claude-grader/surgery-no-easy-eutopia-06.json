  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the inference from 'the target is narrow' to 'eutopia is hard to achieve,' which is moderately central. However, the essay explicitly acknowledges this exact point in its conclusion (Section 4): 'But our discussion so far doesn't imply that we're unlikely to reach eutopia... there could be forces which guide society towards hitting it.' The essay separates the question of target size (this essay) from the question of whether society converges on it (the next essay). So the critique attacks something the position already concedes and defers to a companion essay. Strength: Extremely low. The critique's core claim \u2014 that fussiness creates pressure for institutional convergence \u2014 is essentially asserted without argument. It offers no mechanism explaining why narrow targets would create convergence pressure, no evidence that such self-correction occurs, and no engagement with the many ways the essay argues this could fail. The essay already 'prices in' this consideration by explicitly noting it will be addressed in the next essay on convergence and compromise. The claim of 'causal reversal' is not substantiated \u2014 it's not clear why difficulty would make success more likely rather than less likely. Correctness: The factual claim that the essay concludes fussiness makes eutopia unlikely is somewhat misleading \u2014 the essay carefully limits its conclusion to target narrowness, not achievement probability. The speculative claim about self-correction is not clearly wrong but is unsubstantiated and arguably implausible (many narrow targets in history have not been self-correcting). Clarity: The critique is understandable but somewhat vague about the mechanism. What exactly is the 'causal reversal'? How do narrow targets create convergence pressure? Dead weight: Minimal \u2014 most content contributes to the argument, even if the argument is weak. Single issue: Focuses on one point.",
