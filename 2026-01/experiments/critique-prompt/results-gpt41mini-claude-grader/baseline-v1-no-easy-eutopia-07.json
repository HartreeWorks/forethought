  "reasoning": "Centrality: The multiplicative model (Section 2.4) is an important part of the argument, used to illustrate how single flaws can undermine most value. However, the paper's argument doesn't rest solely on the independence assumption in the toy model \u2014 it's presented as an illustration, and the broader argument (Section 3) proceeds through a systematic analysis of moral views that doesn't depend on independence of factors. The paper also acknowledges it's a 'toy model.' So attacking the independence assumption is moderately central but not devastating. Strength: The critique identifies a real issue \u2014 correlated factors would change the math of the multiplicative model \u2014 but this point is fairly obvious and arguably 'priced in.' The paper presents the multiplicative model as illustrative rather than foundational, and the core argument in Section 3 about fussiness of moral views doesn't rely on factor independence. The critique doesn't engage with how correlation would actually change the conclusions, nor does it show that plausible correlations would make eutopia substantially easier. Many of the factors listed (population ethics, digital being welfare, space governance, wellbeing theory) do seem relatively independent. The critique is too brief and generic to substantially weaken the position. Correctness: It's true that the paper assumes independence in the toy model, and it's true that some factors could be correlated. However, the claim that this 'possibly exaggerates eutopian fragility' is speculative \u2014 correlations could go either way (positive correlations between getting things right would help, but positive correlations between getting things wrong would hurt). Clarity: The critique is understandable but brief \u2014 it could be more specific about which factors are correlated and how this would change conclusions. Dead weight: No dead weight. Single issue: Focuses on one issue.",
