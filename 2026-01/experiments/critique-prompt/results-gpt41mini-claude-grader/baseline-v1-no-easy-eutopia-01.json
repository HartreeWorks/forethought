  "reasoning": "Centrality: The multiplicative model (Section 2.4) is one important component of the paper's argument, but it's not the only one. The paper also argues for fussiness through the systematic analysis of bounded/unbounded views in Section 3, which does not depend on the multiplicative model. Section 3's arguments about linear views, bounded views with separate aggregation, etc. stand independently. So attacking the multiplicative framing undermines perhaps half the argument but not the core technical sections. Strength: The critique is extremely thin \u2014 it merely asserts that alternative aggregation models exist (additive, non-independent) without actually developing the argument. The paper explicitly addresses this: it presents the multiplicative model as illustrative ('toy model'), and the heavy lifting is done in Section 3's systematic analysis of value functions. The paper actually considers additive/linear views extensively and finds them fussy too. The critique doesn't engage with this at all. It also doesn't explain why additive or non-independent models would actually lead to easygoing conclusions \u2014 it just says they 'could significantly alter the conclusion.' This is essentially a generic 'alternatives exist' objection without substance. Correctness: It's true that the paper uses a multiplicative model and that alternative models exist. But the implicit claim that the paper doesn't consider alternatives is partially wrong \u2014 Section 3 systematically examines different value function structures including what are effectively additive (linear) views. The claim that alternatives 'could significantly alter the conclusion' is speculative and unsupported. Clarity: The critique is clear enough in what it's pointing at, though it lacks specificity about which alternative models would actually help and why. Single issue: Focuses on one point. Dead weight: No dead weight \u2014 everything is substantive, just thin.",
