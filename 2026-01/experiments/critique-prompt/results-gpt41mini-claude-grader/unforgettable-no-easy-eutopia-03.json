  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the multiplicative fragility model (Section 2.4), which is a central mechanism in the paper's argument that eutopia is hard. If the multiplicative model is wrong because errors can be corrected/quarantined, this would meaningfully weaken the position. However, the paper's argument doesn't rest solely on the multiplicative model \u2014 Section 3 provides independent formal arguments about why most value functions are fussy regardless of the specific fragility mechanism. So attacking only the multiplicative model doesn't undermine the full argument. Centrality ~0.65.\n\nStrength: The critique is extremely thin \u2014 it merely asserts that future corrective mechanisms (moral AI advisors, decentralized governance, rebellion/reform) 'might' allow quarantining of moral catastrophes, without providing any specific argument for why this would work. The paper actually anticipates and addresses related points: it explicitly discusses how society might converge on correct views or correct errors (mentioning this is the topic of the next essay), and the examples in Section 2.3 involve systemic, civilization-wide decisions (population ethics, space resource allocation, digital being rights) that by their nature cannot be 'quarantined' \u2014 they are global policy choices. The critique doesn't engage with why these particular moral catastrophes resist local correction. Furthermore, the paper's formal arguments in Section 3 about fussiness of value functions don't depend on the multiplicative model at all \u2014 they show fussiness from the structure of value functions themselves. The critique is largely 'priced in' by the paper's own acknowledgment that future essays address convergence and correction mechanisms. Strength ~0.15.\n\nCorrectness: It's true that the paper treats moral factors as relatively independent, and it's true that error-correction mechanisms could in principle make the value product more robust. However, the claim that the paper treats catastrophes as 'fully independent and globally fatal' somewhat mischaracterizes \u2014 the paper presents the multiplicative model as illustrative ('toy model'), not as a strict formal commitment. The suggestion that corrective mechanisms exist is plausible but unsubstantiated. ~0.55.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in what it argues, though somewhat vague on specifics of how error correction would work. ~0.7.\n\nDead weight: Minimal \u2014 most content contributes to the argument. ~0.1.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one issue \u2014 error correction undermining multiplicative fragility. ~0.9.\n\nOverall: The critique identifies a real consideration but executes it very poorly. It's a single paragraph that doesn't engage with the paper's actual examples or formal arguments, doesn't explain why error correction would work for civilization-scale moral choices, and attacks a model the paper itself presents as illustrative while leaving the formal arguments of Section 3 untouched. The insight is largely anticipated by the paper itself. ~0.12.",
