  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper's brief mention in the conclusion (Section 4) that convergence or compromise might guide society toward eutopia, and claims this is undermined by historical analogies of moral/political collapse. However, the paper's core argument is that eutopia is a narrow target ('no easy eutopia'), NOT that we will or won't hit it. Section 4 explicitly defers the question of convergence and compromise to the next essay, stating 'The next essay turns to this question.' So the critique attacks a claim the paper barely makes and explicitly sets aside for future work \u2014 giving low centrality. The strength is also very low: the critique offers only a vague gesture at 'religious schisms, revolutions, and regime collapses' without engaging with any specific mechanism the paper discusses, and doesn't actually rebut the paper's core technical arguments about value functions, multiplicative fragility, or moral catastrophe scenarios. The claim that 'attempts to aim at a singular narrow moral future tend to provoke conflict' is somewhat correct as a historical observation but doesn't engage with the paper's actual framework. Correctness is moderate \u2014 historical instability is real, but the critique's inference that this means eutopia is 'systematically unattainable' is unsupported and arguably non-sequitur (the paper already argues it's hard, just not necessarily impossible). Clarity is moderate \u2014 the general point is discernible but vague. The critique is mostly a single issue (historical instability undermining convergence). Overall very low because it attacks a peripheral, deferred claim with generic historical observations rather than engaging with the paper's substantive arguments.",
