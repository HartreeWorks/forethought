  "reasoning": "The critique targets a reasonably central claim \u2014 that most plausible moral views are fussy about what counts as a mostly-great future, and that the 'easy eutopia' view is likely wrong. This is indeed a core conclusion of the paper, giving moderate-to-high centrality. However, the critique's strength is very low because the paper explicitly and extensively addresses exactly this objection. Section 3 systematically examines which moral views are easygoing versus fussy, and concludes that only a very narrow class of bounded, jointly-aggregating, difference-making views are easygoing \u2014 and those views have serious problems (scale-tipping, stochastic dominance violations, potential pro-extinction implications). The critique simply asserts that 'many moral views would place common-sense utopia above the 50% threshold' without engaging with the paper's detailed arguments for why this isn't so. The paper's Section 2.1 also directly addresses the diversity of moral perspectives and shows that each sees the present as involving moral catastrophe, undermining the idea that pluralism naturally leads to easygoing assessments. The critique's claim that 'aggregate moral uncertainty wouldn't favor such relatively easygoing, pluralistic conceptions' is addressed in Section 3.5 on moral uncertainty. Correctness is low-moderate: it's true that some moral views might rate common-sense utopia highly, but the critique overstates this by ignoring the paper's extensive analysis showing most don't. The claim that tolerance/pluralism makes eutopia easier is asserted without argument and arguably contradicted by the paper's discussion. Clarity is moderate \u2014 the general thrust is understandable but somewhat vague about which specific moral views it has in mind and what 'pluralistic conceptions' means precisely. The critique is essentially a single issue (the breadth of the eutopian target under moral diversity/uncertainty), which is fine. Overall, this critique is almost entirely 'priced in' by the paper \u2014 the paper anticipates and addresses this exact line of reasoning in considerable detail, making the critique add very little.",
