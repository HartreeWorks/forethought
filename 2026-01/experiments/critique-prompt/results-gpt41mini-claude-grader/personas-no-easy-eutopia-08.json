  "reasoning": "The critique attacks the paper's use of von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility axioms and cardinal value functions, claiming this excludes pluralist, incommensurable, or Kantian frameworks. Centrality: The paper explicitly acknowledges this limitation in Section 3.1 ('Not every moral view can reasonably be represented as ascribing cardinal value to different outcomes') and notes that views violating completeness exist. It also explicitly states that the framework doesn't restrict to consequentialist views. The formal analysis in Section 3 does rely on these axioms, but Section 2's arguments about multiplicative fragility, ongoing moral catastrophes, and specific future risks are largely independent of the formal framework. So the formal apparatus is important but not the entirety of the argument \u2014 roughly 45% centrality. Strength: Very low because (1) the paper explicitly anticipates and acknowledges this exact limitation, making the critique largely 'priced in'; (2) the critique provides no specific argument for why pluralist/incommensurable views would be MORE easygoing about eutopia \u2014 if anything, incommensurability and value pluralism would seem to make eutopia harder, not easier, since there are more dimensions along which things can go wrong; (3) the critique doesn't engage with the paper's informal arguments in Section 2 which don't depend on the formal framework; (4) it's generic \u2014 it doesn't explain which specific Kantian or pluralist view would change the conclusion. Correctness: It's true that the paper uses VNM axioms and that some moral frameworks reject these. But claiming this 'marginalizes legitimate dissent' and constitutes a 'biased ethical framework' overstates things \u2014 the paper is transparent about the scope of its formal analysis. The claim that the framework 'implicitly privileges consequentialist aggregation' is partially wrong since the paper explicitly notes non-consequentialist views can satisfy VNM axioms. Clarity: Reasonably clear in what it's arguing, though 'essential complexity in ethical value pluralism' is somewhat vague. Dead weight: 'fails to anticipate objections' is somewhat misleading given the paper does anticipate this, but not pure dead weight. Single issue: Focused on one methodological concern.",
