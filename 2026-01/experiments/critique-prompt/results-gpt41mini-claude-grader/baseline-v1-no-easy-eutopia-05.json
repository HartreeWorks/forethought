  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets a moderately central assumption \u2014 that moral catastrophes are easy to stumble into and hard to self-correct. The paper does assume a somewhat static picture of moral error, and if robust self-corrective mechanisms existed, the 'multiplicative factors' argument would weaken. However, the paper explicitly acknowledges that convergence/navigation mechanisms exist and defers that discussion to the next essay ('Convergence and Compromise'), so the critique is partially attacking something the authors already flag as addressed elsewhere. This reduces centrality somewhat. Strength: The critique is extremely generic \u2014 it merely asserts that moral progress 'could be non-linear and self-corrective' and that the paper 'does not engage deeply with literature on cultural evolution or feedback mechanisms.' It provides no specific argument for why such mechanisms would be strong enough to overcome the fragility the paper describes, no citations, no evidence, and no engagement with the paper's actual technical arguments about multiplicative value structures or the taxonomy of bounded/unbounded views. The paper actually does discuss why self-correction might not work (Section 2.5 on hedonic treadmill effects, engineered preferences, etc.) and explicitly notes the next essay addresses convergence. The critique is almost entirely 'priced in.' Correctness: It's broadly true that the paper doesn't deeply engage with cultural evolution literature, and it's true that moral progress could theoretically be self-corrective. But the claim that this isn't addressed is somewhat misleading given the paper's explicit deferral to a companion essay. Clarity: The critique is understandable but quite vague \u2014 'non-linear and self-corrective' moral progress and 'feedback mechanisms' are gestured at without specification. Dead weight: The mention of 'literature on cultural evolution' without any specifics is somewhat dead weight. Single issue: It's roughly one issue (self-corrective moral progress) but gestures at two (cultural evolution and feedback mechanisms as somewhat separate). Overall: The critique poses essentially no real problem for the position. It's a single vague sentence that attacks something the paper explicitly defers to a companion essay, provides no specific arguments or evidence, and is almost entirely anticipated by the text.",
