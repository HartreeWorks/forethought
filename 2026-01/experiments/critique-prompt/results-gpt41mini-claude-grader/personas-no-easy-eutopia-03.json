  "reasoning": "The critique makes one point: the paper lacks formal mathematical/computational models, making its claims 'unverifiable and non-reproducible,' and therefore unable to serve as a foundation for policy. Centrality: The paper does rely on informal probabilistic reasoning and qualitative arguments throughout Sections 2-3, so attacking the rigor of those arguments is somewhat relevant. However, the paper's core argument is philosophical/conceptual - it's arguing that most plausible moral views are 'fussy' about what counts as a near-best future. The paper does include some formal structure (von Neumann-Morgenstern framework, the multiplicative model, the bounded/unbounded taxonomy). The critique overstates the lack of formalism. More importantly, many of the paper's central arguments are conceptual/philosophical in nature (e.g., the examples of moral catastrophes, the taxonomy of bounded vs unbounded views) where demanding 'code or algorithms' is a category error. Still, the rigor of the probabilistic claims matters somewhat. Strength: Very low. The paper actually does engage with formal frameworks - it explicitly uses vNM utility theory, discusses mathematical properties of bounded/concave functions, and provides quantitative toy models. The critique's claim that there are 'no formal specifications' is partially false. Moreover, the demand for 'code or algorithms' to validate philosophical arguments about moral views is inappropriate - these are normative/conceptual claims, not empirical ones amenable to computational verification. The paper's arguments about fat-tailed distributions, multiplicative value, and bounded views don't require simulation to be evaluated; they follow from conceptual analysis. The critique also doesn't explain what specific formal model would change the conclusions. Correctness: It's true that some claims are informal and could benefit from more formalization. But the claim that there are no formal specifications is incorrect - the paper uses vNM axioms, defines value functions mathematically, and provides quantitative examples. The claim that the arguments are therefore 'unverifiable' conflates formal verifiability with philosophical evaluability. Clarity: The critique is understandable but somewhat vague about what exactly would constitute sufficient formalization. Dead weight: The mention of 'mechanism design or robust policy interventions' is somewhat tangential to whether the paper's philosophical arguments are sound. Single issue: Focuses on one issue - lack of formal rigor.",
