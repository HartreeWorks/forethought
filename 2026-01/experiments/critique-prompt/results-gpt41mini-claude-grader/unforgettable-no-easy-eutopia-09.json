  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the moral uncertainty aggregation discussion in Section 3.5, which is important but not central to the paper's main argument. The paper's core claim\u2014that most plausible moral views are individually fussy\u2014is established in Sections 2 and 3.1-3.4 independently of how one aggregates across views under uncertainty. Section 3.5 is more of an addendum exploring what happens under moral uncertainty; the paper explicitly says 'we don't want to push any strong conclusions' about intertheoretic comparisons. The paper's conclusion that 'easygoingness is unlikely' is primarily driven by the view-by-view analysis showing only a narrow slice of views (jointly-aggregating, low-bounded, difference-making) are easygoing, not by the aggregation method. So even if the aggregation critique fully succeeded, the paper's main argument would largely stand. Centrality ~0.4.\n\nStrength: The critique is largely 'priced in' by the paper itself. Section 3.5 explicitly acknowledges that 'intertheoretic comparisons are very thorny,' shows multiple normalization methods giving dramatically different results, and presents a chart demonstrating exactly the sensitivity the critique points to. The paper already recognizes this ambiguity. The critique doesn't offer any novel argument beyond what the paper itself discusses. It merely restates that aggregation conventions matter, which the paper already concedes. The paper's conclusion about easygoingness being unlikely rests primarily on the first-order analysis of individual views, not on any particular aggregation strategy. Strength ~0.2.\n\nCorrectness: The critique is broadly correct that aggregation methods matter and that different normalizations yield different rankings. However, it overstates the case by claiming the paper's conclusion 'hinges on unresolved metaethical choices' about aggregation\u2014the conclusion primarily hinges on the individual-view analysis. The claim that the paper 'strictly fix[es] scaling between views on extinction and best feasible futures' is somewhat misleading since the paper explicitly considers multiple approaches. Correctness ~0.6.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably understandable but somewhat vague. It doesn't specify which particular aggregation rule would make easygoing views dominant, or precisely how the paper's conclusion would change. The phrase 'If more normatively justified aggregation rules weaken the dominance of fussy views' is hand-wavy. Clarity ~0.6.\n\nDead weight: Minimal dead weight; most content is substantively relevant. ~0.1.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one issue (moral uncertainty aggregation). Score 1.0.\n\nOverall: The critique identifies a real issue (sensitivity to aggregation methods) but one the paper already extensively discusses and acknowledges. It doesn't advance beyond what the paper itself says, and it overstates the degree to which this undermines the paper's main conclusions, which rest on the individual-view analysis rather than cross-view aggregation. ~0.15.",
