  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the separate aggregation analysis in Section 3.3, which is one component of the paper's systematic argument that most plausible bounded views are fussy. However, the paper's overall conclusion rests on multiple independent lines of argument (unbounded linear views are fussy, universe-bounded views are approximately linear, difference-making bounded views with separate aggregation are fussy, and jointly aggregating views have other serious problems). Even if the separate aggregation analysis were undermined, the paper would still conclude 'no easy eutopia' from the other pathways. The Section 2 arguments about multiplicative value and moral catastrophes are also independent. So the attacked claim is meaningful but not central to the overall position.\n\nStrength: The critique asserts that 'most moral theories evaluate [goods and bads] relative to context and tradeoffs' that don't fit separable aggregation. But the paper explicitly acknowledges this distinction \u2014 it considers both separate and joint aggregation, and argues that joint aggregation views face their own problems (scale-tipping, stochastic dominance violations, potential pro-extinction implications). The critique doesn't engage with the paper's actual argument structure: the paper isn't claiming separate aggregation is the only way to model bounded views, but rather that it's the more natural way, and that the alternative (joint aggregation) has its own severe issues. The critique is largely 'priced in' \u2014 the paper already considers exactly this objection and addresses it. The claim that 'context and goal-relative tradeoffs' don't fit the modeling is vague and doesn't specify what alternative aggregation method would be both plausible and easygoing without inheriting the problems the paper identifies.\n\nCorrectness: It's true that many moral theories are context-sensitive and don't treat goods and bads as fully separable \u2014 this is a correct observation. However, the implication that this undermines the fussiness result is questionable, since the paper already considers the non-separable (joint aggregation) alternative and finds problems with it. The claim of a 'reference class failure' is somewhat misleading terminology.\n\nClarity: The critique is understandable but somewhat vague about what alternative aggregation method would avoid the problems. 'Context and goal-relative tradeoffs' is gestured at but not specified.\n\nDead weight: Minimal \u2014 the critique stays on topic.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one point about aggregation methodology.",
