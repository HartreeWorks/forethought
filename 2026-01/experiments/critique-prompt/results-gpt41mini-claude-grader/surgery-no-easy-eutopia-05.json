  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the paper's dismissal of joint aggregation bounded views as implausible (Section 3.3). However, this is only one node in the paper's broader argument tree. The paper's overall conclusion\u2014that most plausible views are fussy\u2014rests on analyzing unbounded linear views, universe-bounded views, difference-making bounded views with separate aggregation, AND joint aggregation views. Even if joint aggregation views were fully rehabilitated, the paper explicitly acknowledges they could be easygoing but argues they represent 'a narrow slice of possible views.' The paper's main conclusion would still stand from the other branches. So centrality is moderate-low.\n\nStrength: The critique suggests these views 'might behave well within certain reasonable scales and only exhibit scale-tipping behaviors beyond practically attainable limits.' But the paper explicitly addresses this concern: the scale-tipping problem occurs precisely at the scales relevant to civilizational futures (millions of galaxies of goods and bads). The paper's example involves galaxy-scale futures, which are exactly what the paper considers practically relevant given space settlement. The critique doesn't engage with the specific numerical example or explain why the relevant scales are impractical. It's essentially a bare assertion that the problem might not arise in practice, without demonstrating this. The paper also raises multiple independent problems with joint aggregation views (stochastic dominance violations, pro-extinction tendencies, difference-making issues), and the critique only gestures at one. Very low strength.\n\nCorrectness: It's technically true that concave bounded functions behave more linearly at smaller scales, and that some pathological behaviors might only manifest at extreme scales. But the claim that joint aggregation views 'might work perfectly fine at any realistic scale' is speculative and unsubstantiated, and the paper's examples suggest the problems arise at scales the paper considers realistic. Roughly half correct.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in what it claims, though it lacks specificity about what 'realistic scale' means or where the cliff would be.\n\nDead weight: Minimal.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one point about joint aggregation bounded views.\n\nOverall: The critique identifies a potentially valid logical possibility but doesn't develop it with enough rigor or specificity to pose a real problem for the paper. The paper already acknowledges joint aggregation views could be easygoing but argues against their plausibility on multiple grounds, most of which the critique doesn't address.",
