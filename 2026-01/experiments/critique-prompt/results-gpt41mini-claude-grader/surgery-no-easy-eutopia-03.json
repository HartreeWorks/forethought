  "reasoning": "Centrality: The critique targets the fragility/narrow-target claim (Sections 2.3-2.4), which is important to the position but not the only argument. The position also makes systematic arguments in Section 3 about why most plausible moral views are fussy regardless of institutional error-correction. Even if error-correcting institutions existed, the Section 3 arguments about the mathematical structure of value functions (linear views requiring specific resource use, bounded views being fussy about bads) would remain untouched. So the critique attacks a moderately central but not fully necessary part. Strength: Very low. The position explicitly anticipates and addresses this type of objection. The essay notes that the next essay covers 'convergence and compromise' \u2014 whether society can navigate toward the target \u2014 and explicitly states 'The target is narrow, but there could be forces which guide society towards hitting it.' The critique is essentially making the point the authors themselves flag as the subject of their next essay. Moreover, the position's argument doesn't rest solely on the claim that errors are easy to make; it rests on the deeper claim that the TARGET ITSELF is narrow across most plausible moral views (Section 3). Error-correcting institutions could help navigate toward a target, but they don't make the target bigger. The critique also doesn't engage with the specific mechanisms of fragility \u2014 e.g., disagreements about population ethics, digital welfare, or resource allocation aren't obviously the kind of thing 'error-correcting institutions' would fix, since they involve deep moral disagreements rather than detectable errors. The critique is largely 'priced in.' Correctness: It's true that societies develop error-correcting institutions, but the claim that these would be sufficient to catch moral mistakes across the many dimensions discussed is speculative and unsupported. Many of the position's examples (animal welfare, population ethics) involve moral blind spots that persist despite existing institutions. Clarity: The critique is understandable but vague \u2014 it doesn't specify what these error-correcting institutions would look like or how they'd address the specific types of moral errors discussed. Dead weight: The summary sentence and the critique body are mostly on-point, though somewhat thin in substance. Single issue: Focuses on one issue (institutional error-correction). Overall: The critique poses almost no problem for the position because (1) it's explicitly anticipated by the authors, (2) it doesn't engage with the Section 3 technical arguments about value function structure, and (3) it provides no specific mechanism or evidence for why error-correcting institutions would work across the diverse moral dimensions discussed.",
