  "reasoning": "Centrality: The moral uncertainty aggregation in Section 3.5 is explicitly presented as a supplementary analysis, not a core argument. The main thesis\u2014'no easy eutopia'\u2014is established through Section 2 (fragility of value, multiplicative factors, future catastrophes) and Section 3.2-3.4 (showing most individual moral views are fussy). Section 3.5 explores what happens under uncertainty between views, but even if that entire section were invalidated, the conclusion that most plausible individual views are fussy would stand. The position explicitly acknowledges that 'intertheoretic comparisons are very thorny, so we don't want to push any strong conclusions' from that section. So the critique attacks a non-central part.\n\nStrength: The critique raises the well-known problem of intertheoretic value comparisons\u2014that value scales may be fundamentally incomparable. However, the position already extensively acknowledges this difficulty, exploring multiple normalization methods and noting their limitations. The position doesn't claim to resolve intertheoretic comparisons; it uses them to draw tentative conclusions and explicitly hedges. Moreover, the critique overstates the problem: the position argues that most individual views are fussy (Section 3.4 recap), so even without any aggregation, the conclusion holds for most views considered individually. The critique also doesn't engage with the position's point that even under uncertainty, fussy views tend to dominate decision-making because they are higher-stakes. The claim that aggregation 'produces an indeterminate result' is too strong\u2014there is substantial philosophical literature on intertheoretic comparisons, and while contested, the enterprise is not obviously incoherent.\n\nCorrectness: The claim that fundamentally incomparable value scales can't be meaningfully averaged is a real concern in metaethics, so it's not wrong as a philosophical point. However, saying aggregation 'just produces an indeterminate result' is too strong\u2014there are defensible approaches to intertheoretic comparisons. The critique is partially correct but overstated.\n\nClarity: The critique is reasonably clear in what it argues, though brief.\n\nDead weight: No dead weight.\n\nSingle issue: Focuses on one issue\u2014intertheoretic value comparisons.",
