  "reasoning": "The critique points out that the paper's analysis relies on the von Neumann-Morgenstern framework (completeness axiom, cardinal utility representation) and doesn't address metaethical positions like expressivism or moral particularism that might reject this framework. This is a real observation \u2014 the paper does explicitly acknowledge this limitation in Section 3.1 ('Not every moral view can reasonably be represented as ascribing cardinal value to different outcomes... some views might be unable to compare some pairs of prospects at all, violating the completeness axiom'). So the critique is partially 'priced in.' Centrality is moderate but not high: while the formal analysis in Section 3 does depend on the vNM framework, the paper's core argument operates on multiple levels. Section 2's arguments about moral catastrophes, multiplicative value factors, and the hedonic treadmill analogy are largely independent of the formal framework. Even if one rejected cardinal utility entirely, the qualitative argument that eutopia requires getting many things right simultaneously would still stand. The strength is very low because (1) the paper explicitly acknowledges this limitation, (2) the critique doesn't explain *how* expressivism or moral particularism would actually change the conclusions \u2014 it merely notes they exist, (3) it doesn't argue that these alternative metaethical frameworks would make eutopia *easier* to achieve, and (4) the paper's argument is designed to be robust across a wide range of views that *can* be represented in this way. Correctness is moderate: it's true that expressivism and moral particularism exist and that they pose challenges for cardinal utility frameworks, but claiming this 'limits the generalizability' is somewhat overstated since the paper is explicit about its scope. The critique is reasonably clear and focused on a single issue, with minimal dead weight.",
