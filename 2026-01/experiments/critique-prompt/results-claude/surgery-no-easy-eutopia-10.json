  "reasoning": "The critique targets the choice to define \u201cbest feasible future\u201d as the 99.99th percentile. That benchmark is part of the paper\u2019s formalism, but it is largely a stipulation/normalization device rather than a substantive premise; the core \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d case rests on claims about moral fragility, fat-tailed value-efficiency, and structural properties of value functions, which would mostly survive changing this percentile. So centrality is limited.\n\nStrength is low because varying the percentile mostly changes labels/thresholds (\u201cbest feasible\u201d, \u201cmostly-great\u201d) rather than showing that, relative to a fixed notion of near-optimality, near-best futures are actually common. In particular, saying \u201cif you redefine best feasible to be less extreme, more futures count as mostly-great\u201d is close to a definitional point, not a refutation. The critique also overstates dependence: the paper explicitly notes there\u2019s nothing magical about the thresholds and uses them for convenience.\n\nCorrectness is moderate: it is true the paper offers limited principled justification for 99.99 specifically, and some numeric illustrations would shift under other cutoffs. But the critique\u2019s claim that the paper\u2019s main conclusion could \u201creverse\u201d with modest changes is not well-supported and likely false given the argument\u2019s qualitative backbone.\n\nClarity is high, dead weight is minimal, and it focuses on a single issue.",
