  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s use of the \u201cCommon-sense utopia\u201d vignette as a benchmark, arguing it is too underspecified to support some of the later quantitative/illustrative comparisons (e.g., treating it as ~0.8 of max value on some bounded views). This is a real methodological weakness for the illustrative calibration/intuition-pumping parts, but it is not highly central to the paper\u2019s main case for \u201cno easy eutopia,\u201d which is driven more by (i) many distinct potential moral catastrophes/fragilities and (ii) the \u2018fussy vs easygoing\u2019 analysis across broad classes of value functions. The point is mostly correct (the scenario is vague and different precisifications could alter rankings), though it somewhat overstates dependence: the paper often frames these as examples rather than essential premises. The critique is clear, focused on a single issue, and contains little dead weight.",
