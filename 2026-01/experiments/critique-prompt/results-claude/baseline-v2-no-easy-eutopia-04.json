  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s hedonic-treadmill analogy in \u00a72.5, arguing it\u2019s ambivalent and could imply we overestimate (not underestimate) the gap to eutopia. That point is generally reasonable, but it is not very central to the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d case, which mainly rests on moral-fragility considerations and the later technical argument about fussy value functions. Moreover, the essay itself partially anticipates the critique by explicitly noting the analogy could be misleading and that shortfalls might be non-salient to future inhabitants, so the critique weakens only a small, already-qualified supporting intuition. It is clearly stated, focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
