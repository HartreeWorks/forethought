  "reasoning": "The critique targets Section 3.5\u2019s moral-uncertainty/intertheoretic-comparison discussion, specifically the paper\u2019s tentative use of a \u201cpairwise\u201d method to argue unbounded views may deserve more weight. That section is supportive but not essential to the overall \u201cno easy eutopia / most views are fussy\u201d thesis, which is also defended via independent arguments (fragility/multiplicative factors, bounded/unbounded fussiness analysis). So centrality is moderate-low. The critique has some force: it correctly flags that pairwise comparisons rely on controversial cross-theory commensurability judgments and that different normalizations can flip recommendations, weakening any strong inference that unbounded views should loom largest. However, it overstates by saying the conclusion rests \u201centirely\u201d on a manufactured bridge; the paper explicitly treats this as thorny and presents multiple methods without a decisive endorsement. It\u2019s also partly incorrect to say utilitarianism and strict negative utilitarianism cannot \u2018agree on the disvalue of bads\u2019 in any sense\u2014there can be agreement about the internal scaling of suffering (how bad bads are relative to bads) even if they disagree about compensation by goods. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",
