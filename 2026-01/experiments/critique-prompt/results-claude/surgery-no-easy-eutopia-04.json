  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s appeal to historical \u201congoing moral catastrophes\u201d (Section 2.1) as evidence that serious moral flaws are likely by default in the future, arguing this is a bad reference class. This point is somewhat central as one support for \u2018eutopia is fragile\u2019, but the overall \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 case is substantially overdetermined by other arguments (Section 2.3\u2019s many future-specific failure modes, the multiplicative-factor model, and the technical Section 3 analysis of value functions). If the historical analogy were weakened, the position would be only modestly weakened, not collapse. The critique has moderate strength: it correctly notes that extrapolating from pre/post-scarcity conditions is nontrivial and that \u201cpost-scarcity + extensive moral deliberation\u201d has no clear historical sample. However, the position uses history more as a debiasing/possibility argument (\u201cnon-obvious but severe flaws are the norm across history and moral views\u201d) than as a straightforward statistical induction, and abundance doesn\u2019t obviously remove moral error, institutional lock-in, motivated reasoning, or new digital/space-scale failure modes. Correctness is mixed: the reference-class concern is plausible, but claims like \u2018past catastrophes often resulted from scarcity and abundance eliminates them\u2019 overstate the role of scarcity and overstate what abundance guarantees. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",
