  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important support for the paper\u2019s \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion\u2014namely the move from historical moral blindness / present moral dissensus to the claim that near-best futures are a tiny target. If that move were significantly weakened, the paper would lose a major intuitive plank in Section 2 (fragility via non-obvious moral flaws). However, the overall position is also supported by additional, more technical arguments (e.g., multiplicative fragility modelling, population-ethical variance, and especially Section 3\u2019s claims about bounded/unbounded value functions and fussiness), so this critique doesn\u2019t strike at a single necessary premise. On strength: it fairly points out an inferential gap/equivocation (\u201cwe might be wrong\u201d vs \u201cnear-best is very unlikely by default\u201d) and proposes an alternative mechanism (abundance + information improving moral learning), but it doesn\u2019t engage the paper\u2019s broader set of examples of value-loss that persist under abundance, nor offer an actual model or evidence that convergence/automatic correction is likely, so it only moderately weakens the targeted step. Relevance is relatively high because Forethought treats eutopia-as-narrow-target and moral convergence dynamics as central to the Better Futures agenda and as an area of active investigation (Tier 3: convergence/compromise); the critique is directionally aligned with what would be decision-relevant (a concrete moral-learning model), even though it doesn\u2019t supply one.",
