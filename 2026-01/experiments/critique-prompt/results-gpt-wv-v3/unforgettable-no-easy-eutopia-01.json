  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central piece of the essay\u2019s framing: treating \u201cfussy vs easygoing\u201d as a substantive property derived from cardinal value + thresholds like v>0.5, and using that to support the headline \u201ceasygoingness is unlikely.\u201d If the fussiness notion were ill-defined, that would significantly weaken the argumentative structure (so centrality is moderate-high). However, the critique overstates the affine-rescaling problem: in the main text the authors effectively fix the affine freedom by stipulating v(extinction)=0 and v(best feasible)=1, which (if taken as a definitional normalization) removes the ability to rescale and thereby change the probability mass above 0.5. So the \u201ccollapses under affine rescaling\u201d objection does not strongly refute the within-theory fussiness claim as presented; it more plausibly presses that the chosen anchoring/thresholding is morally loaded and could have been chosen differently, and that cross-theory comparisons (especially under moral uncertainty) are sensitive to normalization\u2014something the paper itself already partly concedes. This makes the critique directionally relevant but only moderately damaging. It is nevertheless quite relevant to Forethought\u2019s agenda because it engages an active methodological fault line they emphasize (intertheoretic comparisons / normalization under moral uncertainty and how to define \u2018narrow targets\u2019 robustly), and it suggests a constructive repair (representation-invariant notions). Overall: useful but not decisive.",
