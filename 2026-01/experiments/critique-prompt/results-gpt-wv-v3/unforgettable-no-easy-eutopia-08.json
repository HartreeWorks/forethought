  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific sub-argument in \u00a73.3: that (on bounded, separate-aggregation views) even a 1/10^22 fraction of \u2018bads\u2019 prevents a mostly-great future because the absolute quantity of bads becomes large when multiplied by ~10^22 star-systems. If that scaling argument failed, it would weaken one route to \u201cviews are fussy,\u201d but the paper has multiple other independent supports for \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 (fragility/product-of-factors; unbounded/linear arguments; other sources of fussiness), so centrality is moderate.\n\nOn strength: it correctly notes that the star-count arithmetic is illustrative and that some implicit assumptions about additivity/separability and moral measure are doing work. However, it somewhat overstates the arbitrariness: if bads aggregate separately and approximately add across space, changing the \u201cunit\u201d (stars vs people vs computational capacity) doesn\u2019t remove the basic point, because total \u2018bad mass\u2019 still scales with total resources/population. The proposed alternatives (local saturation, quarantine, worst-pocket dominance) correspond to substantively different normative aggregation rules (non-additive, non-separable, or maximin-ish), which may be \u201cplausible\u201d but aren\u2019t argued for here and would amount to switching away from the class of views \u00a73.3 is analyzing rather than showing an internal flaw in the derivation. So it raises a real modeling/assumption-pressure point but doesn\u2019t by itself overturn the result.\n\nRelevance is fairly high within Forethought\u2019s agenda because it engages the internal technical apparatus for \u2018fussiness\u2019 (Tier-2-ish in their framework) and asks for a principled account of how disvalue composes over space\u2014an issue that bears on their value-function taxonomy\u2014but it\u2019s not squarely a Tier 3 live strategic dispute. Overall reflects modest damage (strength\u00d7centrality) with some credit for pointing to a potentially important hidden assumption.",
