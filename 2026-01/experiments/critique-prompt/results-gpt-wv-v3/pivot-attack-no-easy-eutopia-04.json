  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific quantitative \u201cpunchline\u201d used to argue that bounded, separately-aggregating views are extremely fussy (the 1-in-10^22 bad-resources example). That claim supports (but is not necessary for) the paper\u2019s broader conclusion that most plausible moral views are fussy and thus \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d is likely, so centrality is moderate-low. The objection has moderate strength: it correctly notes that the star-count step depends on an unstated mapping from \u2018fraction of resources\u2019 to \u2018units of bad\u2019 and on how quickly the bad-aggregation function approaches its bound; without specifying those, the numerical threshold is under-justified and could shift substantially. However, it doesn\u2019t show separate-aggregation bounded views are not fussy\u2014only that this extreme version of the argument is not established and could be repaired with clearer modeling/assumptions. Relevance is moderate-high because it engages Forethought\u2019s Tier-2/Tier-3-adjacent work on how moral-value functional forms drive conclusions about flourishing difficulty, and it points to a concrete place where the analysis may be brittle to measurement/units choices.",
