  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s claim (in the moral-uncertainty section) that \u201cfair/plausible\u201d intertheoretic comparison methods tend to make unbounded/fussy views loom larger, helping make \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 robust under moral uncertainty. This is a load-bearing support for one strand of robustness, but it is not central to the essay\u2019s core case for eutopian fragility (historical moral catastrophe evidence, multiplicative/product model, and direct arguments that many views are fussy). So centrality is moderate rather than high.\n\nOn strength: the critique correctly notes that the essay\u2019s own examples show high sensitivity to normalization, and it reasonably demands either (i) a stronger defense of the specific comparison procedures that yield \u201cunbounded looms larger\u201d or (ii) a downgrade of robustness claims. Pointing to alternative moral-uncertainty decision rules (bargaining/parliamentary, minimax-regret, dominance-avoidance) is a plausible challenge. However, it remains under-argued: it doesn\u2019t show that these alternatives are (a) more plausible than the essay\u2019s favored approaches, (b) actually avoid giving substantial weight to high-stakes unbounded theories once you model them carefully, or (c) would materially resurrect \u201ceasy eutopia\u201d as a default rather than merely reintroducing underdetermination. So it weakens the targeted claim but doesn\u2019t refute it.\n\nRelevance is fairly high because moral uncertainty and how it interacts with trajectory/flourishing is directly within Forethought\u2019s \u201cBetter Futures\u201d agenda and intersects an area where the essay itself flags thorniness and choice-sensitivity (a live, decision-relevant methodological question rather than a Tier-1 premise).\n\nOverall reflects modest direct damage to the overall thesis (strength\u00d7centrality) with an uptick for hitting a live methodological issue, but limited by lack of detailed engagement with specific intertheoretic frameworks and their implications.",
