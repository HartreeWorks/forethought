  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific step in \u00a73.3: that separately-aggregating bounded difference-making views become extremely fussy because even ~1 part in 10^22 of resources devoted to \u201cbads\u201d prevents a mostly-great future. This step supports (but is not necessary for) the broader \u201cmost plausible views are fussy / no easy eutopia\u201d conclusion, since the essay also argues fussiness from unbounded linear views, from near-linearity of many bounded views, and from other fragility considerations. So centrality is modest.\n\nThe objection\u2019s main move\u2014engineering fault isolation\u2014does not directly undermine the moral-aggregation claim being made. The essay\u2019s point is not primarily about bads \u2018propagating\u2019 through a system, but about additive/separately-transformed aggregation: if disvalue from bads is scaled/treated such that a star-system\u2019s worth of bads pushes you near the disvalue bound, then even perfectly sandboxed bads still count morally and still lower total value. Containment can matter by reducing intensity/duration (i.e., lowering bads per unit resource) or by making \u2018bads\u2019 rarer, but the critique doesn\u2019t engage the core mathematical structure (separate concave transform on goods plus separate transform on bads) or show that realistic containment would change the scaling enough to defeat the 10^22-style conclusion under the specified view. Hence low strength.\n\nRelevance is moderate: it engages Forethought\u2019s Tier-2 modeling choice about how value aggregates and the implication that avoiding tiny fractions of bads requires near-perfectionist governance. It\u2019s not directly a Tier-3 open question, but it does connect to live concerns about governance overreach and how \u201cfragility\u201d assumptions translate into institutional recommendations.",
