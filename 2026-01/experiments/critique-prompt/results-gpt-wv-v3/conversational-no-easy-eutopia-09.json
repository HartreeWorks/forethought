  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s key definitional setup for \u2018fussy/easygoing\u2019\u2014the probability distribution over futures conditional on survival and on \u201cno serious coordinated optimisation de dicto.\u201d If that baseline is ill-specified or unrealistic, the paper\u2019s claims about how *rare* mostly-great futures are (under that distribution) are undermined. However, much of the paper\u2019s support for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d is not purely distributional: it argues that many plausible moral views are intrinsically fussy (multiplicative fragility, linear/unbounded resource sensitivity, bounded-view sensitivity to bads), and it explicitly notes that a narrow target doesn\u2019t imply we\u2019re unlikely to hit it because guiding forces might exist (deferred to the next essay). So the attacked premise is important but not fully load-bearing for the main conclusion. The argument offered is reasonable\u2014post-AGI \u2018default\u2019 coordination and moral reflection could be far above today\u2019s, and the paper\u2019s baseline is ambiguous\u2014but it does not show that this coordination would be de dicto, that it would robustly steer toward near-best outcomes rather than intensify lock-in to parochial aims, or that the paper\u2019s main fussiness arguments fail under alternative baselines. Relevance is high because it probes a cross-tier interaction (transformative AI \u2192 changed default optimisation/coordination) and connects directly to Forethought\u2019s active questions about predetermination, lock-in, and whether flourishing is \u2018default\u2019 given survival.",
