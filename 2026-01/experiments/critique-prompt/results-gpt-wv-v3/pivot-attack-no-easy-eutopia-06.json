  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important sub-argument in \u00a73.2: that linear/separable moral views make mostly-great futures a narrow target because (i) there is effectively a single value-efficient local arrangement to replicate and (ii) the space of uses is so large that near-optimal uses are rare. If this inference failed, Forethought\u2019s claim that linear views are fussy would be weakened, but the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion has multiple independent supports (eutopian fragility/product-of-factors in \u00a72; fussiness of many bounded views in \u00a73.3; moral uncertainty considerations), so it wouldn\u2019t collapse. On strength, the objection correctly notes a logical gap: separability/additivity does not entail uniqueness or small measure of near-maximizers, and large symmetry/degeneracy classes could make \u2018almost optimal per resource\u2019 common. However, it only partially undercuts the paper because the paper\u2019s core driver for narrowness is the additional (defeasible) empirical/structural claim of a fat-tailed value-efficiency distribution; the critique gestures at, but doesn\u2019t provide, reasons to expect thick near-optimal sets under realistic constraints. Relevance is fairly high because it engages a key Tier-2 Forethought assumption/argument about why even \u201cgood\u201d surviving futures likely miss most value, and it points to a concrete place where an extra argument (about the measure/volume of near-optimal configurations) would be needed.",
