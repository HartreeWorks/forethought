  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real support-beam in the essay\u2019s case for \u201ceutopian fragility\u201d: the appeal to history/cross-view \u201congoing moral catastrophes\u201d as evidence that large, non-obvious moral errors are easy to make and persist by default (Sections 2.1\u20132.3). If that evidential arrow reverses (abundance/capability tends to trigger moral self-correction), it weakens the claim that conditional-on-survival futures are broadly likely to miss most value without deliberate steering. However, the essay\u2019s overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion is also supported by other considerations the critique doesn\u2019t touch much (novel future moral hazards like digital minds/population ethics, the multiplicative/product model, and the Section 3 argument that many plausible value functions are intrinsically \u2018fussy\u2019). So centrality is moderate rather than decisive. Strength is moderate: the historical-progress point is plausible and clearly articulated, but it\u2019s under-argued (limited engagement with moral backsliding, selection effects, and the possibility that future \u2018moral learning\u2019 may not generalize to highly alien, non-salient issues like population ethics or digital welfare). Relevance is fairly high because it bears directly on Forethought\u2019s Tier-2/near-Tier-3 questions about whether flourishing is \u2018predetermined\u2019 and whether moral progress/convergence mechanisms widen the target conditional on survival. Overall impact is meaningful but not crippling.",
