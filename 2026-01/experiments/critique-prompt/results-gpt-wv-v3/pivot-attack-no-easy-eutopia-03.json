  "reasoning": "The critique targets a load-bearing step in \u00a73.3: that \u201cuniverse-bounded\u201d concave value functions are practically linear (and thus fussy) because humanity\u2019s marginal effect on total universal value is tiny due to vast background value (aliens/infinite universe). If that step fails, a nontrivial class of bounded views could remain genuinely concave over the relevant range, potentially making near-best futures easier. However, this is not fully central to the paper\u2019s overall \u2018no easy eutopia\u2019 conclusion, which is also supported by (i) the multiplicative-fragility argument in \u00a72, (ii) unbounded/linear-resource fussiness, and (iii) bounded difference-making views becoming fussy via bads/aggregation. So centrality is moderate, not high.\n\nThe objection has decent force: it correctly identifies that the paper\u2019s \u2018approximately linear\u2019 move depends on empirical/cosmological premises that could be false (rare life, value-empty universe, large controllable lightcone). But it under-argues key follow-through: even if there\u2019s little background value, universe-bounded concavity can still be locally ~linear if the upper bound is very high relative to achievable value, and the critique doesn\u2019t engage that parameter choice or other reasons the paper gives for bounded views being fussy. Hence moderate strength.\n\nRelevance is fairly high because it engages an internal argumentative hinge in Forethought\u2019s better-futures framework (how bounded views behave in practice), rather than disputing Tier 1 premises; it connects to their ongoing work on moral uncertainty/value functions, though it\u2019s not clearly one of the explicitly highlighted Tier 3 disputes.",
