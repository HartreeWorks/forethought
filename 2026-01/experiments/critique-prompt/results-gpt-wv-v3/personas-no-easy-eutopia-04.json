  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central support pillar of the paper: Section 3\u2019s attempt to formalise \u201cfussiness/easygoingness\u201d via VNM-style representability and gamble-based cardinalisation, then use that to argue that most plausible moral views are fussy. If that formalisation were undermined, the paper would lose a major systematic argument (though Section 2\u2019s more informal \u201cfragility/product-of-factors\u201d case would largely remain), so centrality is moderate.\n\nOn strength: it\u2019s a real methodological objection\u2014VNM completeness/continuity does exclude lexical/sacred-value structures that are common in deontological/religious/rights-based ethics, and defining quantitative value via extinction gambles can make the \u201cfanaticism\u201d result look partly artefactual. However, the critique overstates circularity: the paper explicitly restricts scope to VNM-satisfying views (and notes some non-consequentialisms can be represented), and many of the paper\u2019s \u201cfussiness\u201d conclusions are driven by resource/scale and aggregation-structure considerations that would still bite for large classes of consequentialist or tradeoff-admitting views. Also, calling intertheoretic normalisation a \u201ctechnical nuisance\u201d is not quite fair given the paper\u2019s extended discussion of how decisive it can be.\n\nRelevance is low because it primarily challenges Forethought\u2019s Tier 1 commitment to expected-value/VNM-style decision frameworks, which the organisational primer treats as largely settled; it doesn\u2019t engage a Tier 3 live question so much as dispute the adopted decision-theoretic/moral-uncertainty regime.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a moderately insightful but not decisive critique with limited usefulness for Forethought\u2019s current agenda.",
  "title": "The critique argues that the paper's core mechanism smuggles deontological views into expected-utility gambles, making the conclusion circular."
