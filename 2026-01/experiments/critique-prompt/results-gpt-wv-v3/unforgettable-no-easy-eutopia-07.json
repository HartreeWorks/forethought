  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific load-bearing step in \u00a73.2: the move from (unbounded) linearity to separability/replicability and then to the \u201cmust capture most galaxies or lose ~all value\u201d claim. If that bridge failed, it would weaken one of the paper\u2019s main routes to concluding that plausible moral views are fussy. However, the paper also argues for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d via other routes (fragility/product-of-factors, moral catastrophe examples, bounded-view analysis), so refuting this step would not collapse the overall thesis, hence moderate centrality.\n\nOn strength: the critique correctly notes that linearity in \u2018resources for good\u2019 does not automatically entail the kind of parcel-wise separability the paper uses, if value depends on global/relational properties (rights, legitimacy, non-domination) or on coordination mechanisms (incl. acausal trade) that can make \u201cmissing resources\u201d not translate to proportional value loss. But the paper is explicitly analyzing \u201clinear views\u201d as separable at scale (essentially the standard utilitarian/additive picture), so the critique partly looks like a reclassification move (\u201cthose linear-but-nonseparable views exist\u201d) rather than a direct refutation of the argument as applied to the intended class. It therefore weakens the generality of the conclusion about linear views, but doesn\u2019t decisively refute it.\n\nRelevance is fairly high because it engages a Tier-2 core claim in Forethought\u2019s better-futures agenda (narrow target/fussiness) and points to an interaction/tension with mechanisms the paper itself raises (acausal trade; global constraints), potentially affecting how their EV decomposition over survival vs flourishing should treat \u2018scale capture\u2019.",
