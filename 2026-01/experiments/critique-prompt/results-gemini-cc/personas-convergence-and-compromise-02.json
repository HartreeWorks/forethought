  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s optimism about moral trade being facilitated by \u201ciron-clad contracts\u201d enabled by superintelligence. This is relevant to section 3\u2019s pathway (trade/compromise), but it is not fully central to the overall position (which is broader: pessimism about WAM-convergence, mixed/conditional optimism about trade under various conditions, plus many other blockers like threats and power concentration). The critique has some force because the essay does not spell out concrete verification/enforcement mechanisms, so it weakens the credibility of that enabling assumption. However, it overstates the dependency (trade needn\u2019t \u2018collapse\u2019 entirely without perfect trustless protocols) and demands an arguably too-strong standard (mathematical guarantees against any superintelligent adversary), so it doesn\u2019t robustly refute the trade argument. It is mostly clear and focused, with minor rhetorical fluff.",
