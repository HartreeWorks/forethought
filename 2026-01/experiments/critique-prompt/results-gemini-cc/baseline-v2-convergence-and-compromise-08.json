  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s skepticism in \u00a74.1 that self-interest (even with convergence on prudential good) will reliably yield a mostly-great future. If mechanism/institution design could robustly align self-interest with \u201cthe aggregate good,\u201d that would weaken the paper\u2019s pessimism about the \u2018no one aims at the good\u2019 route, but it wouldn\u2019t overturn the paper\u2019s main thrust about low likelihood of WAM-convergence and the conditional, obstacle-laden optimism about moral trade; hence only moderate centrality. The argument itself is suggestive but underdeveloped: it asserts that alignment is a \u2018solvable technical problem\u2019 without addressing core difficulties the paper emphasizes or implies (e.g., what objective function institutions should implement given moral disagreement/anti-realism, incentive compatibility under value pluralism, information/commitment problems, capture, and whether \u2018aggregate good\u2019 is even well-defined absent convergence). Still, it\u2019s directionally plausible that advanced mechanism design could improve incentive alignment relative to today, so it has some (limited) weakening power. Claims are partly correct but overconfident in calling it merely technical and solvable. The critique is clear, focused on a single issue, and contains little dead weight.",
