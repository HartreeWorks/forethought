  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s conditional pessimism in \u00a73.2 that if the correct (or dominant) views are non-discounting and roughly linear-in-resources, gains from moral trade/compromise may be small because there\u2019s little \u201csatiation\u201d and limited resource-compatibility. If that pessimism were overturned, the essay would be somewhat more optimistic about reaching mostly-great futures via trade, but it would not collapse the broader position (which also emphasizes threats, power concentration, lock-in, weak convergence, etc.), so centrality is moderate-low.\n\nOn strength: the essay already explicitly notes location-of-resources, time-to-access, and other friction-like reasons for trade (including speed-of-light/uncertainty) in \u00a73.1, so the core move (\u201cphysics makes distant resources less valuable/more costly to realize\u201d) is substantially \u2018priced in.\u2019 Moreover, higher acquisition costs or access constraints don\u2019t by themselves create the kind of diminishing marginal utility/\u201ceasy satiation\u201d that makes compromise broadly value-preserving for linear views; they more directly create heterogeneous marginal values over *which* resources are usable/soon-usable, which the essay already treats as a basis for trade but not as solving incompatibility between highly particular linear objectives. So it weakens the targeted worry only a bit.\n\nCorrectness is middling: it\u2019s true that physics (latency, coordination limits, thermodynamics) constrains effective control and can create strong locality effects, but claims like \u201cexponential costs beyond a radius\u201d are not established and aren\u2019t generally true without extra assumptions. Clarity is high and it stays on one issue with little dead weight.",
