  "reasoning": "The critique targets the essay\u2019s emphasis (in \u00a72) on de dicto motivation as part of WAM-convergence, arguing de re preference-overlap could suffice. This is somewhat central to the structure of \u00a72, but not to the essay\u2019s overall conclusion, which explicitly considers non-de-dicto pathways in \u00a74 (and is overall more optimistic about trade/compromise in \u00a73). The critique\u2019s refutation power is limited: it mainly asserts a possibility (stable overlapping instrumental subgoals) without engaging the essay\u2019s core reasons for pessimism (narrow-target/fork arguments, increasing optimization revealing deep value divergence, and why instrumental overlap may break once \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 is exhausted). It also overstates by implying the paper assumes de dicto is necessary; the paper explicitly entertains cases where no one aims at the good de dicto and argues they\u2019re unlikely under \u201cno easy eutopia.\u201d Still, the core point\u2014that de dicto motivation is not strictly necessary for good outcomes in principle\u2014is correct. The critique is clear, focused, and contains little dead weight.",
