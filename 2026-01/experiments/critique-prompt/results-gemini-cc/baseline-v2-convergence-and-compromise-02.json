  "reasoning": "The critique targets a fairly central move in the essay\u2019s case against WAM/AM-convergence under anti-realism: that subjective idealization has many \u201cfree parameters\u201d and so will diverge, making convergence unlikely. If the shared-human-priors point fully neutralized that divergence argument, it would noticeably weaken the essay\u2019s pessimism about convergence (though not collapse the overall position, which also relies on realism/motivation worries, self-modification, power concentration, threats, etc.). However, the critique is mostly an assertion: it doesn\u2019t show that shared biological priors are strong enough to keep long-run reflective/idealized values tightly clustered given the essay\u2019s own emphasis on extensive reflection, changing \u201cnature,\u201d uploads/self-modification, and AI-advisor heterogeneity. Also, the essay already gestures at \u201cshared human preferences\u201d and explicitly argues they are underpowered for picking out a near-best future in a huge space, so the \u201cignores\u201d framing is partly inaccurate. The core factual premise (humans share evolved motivational/affective architecture) is broadly correct, but the inference to tight clustering of idealized values is speculative and underargued. The critique is clear, focused, and has little dead weight.",
