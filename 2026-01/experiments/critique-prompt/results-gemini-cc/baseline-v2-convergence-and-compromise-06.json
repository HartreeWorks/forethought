  "reasoning": "The critique targets one sub-argument in \u00a72.4.1: that if moral realism is true, the correct morality is likely \u2018alien\u2019 and thus non-motivational (undermining WAM-convergence). This is only moderately central because the essay\u2019s overall pessimism about WAM-convergence also rests heavily on the antirealism branch, on motivation failures even under realism, and on blockers/power/trade dynamics; refuting the \u2018alien realism\u2019 framing would weaken but not collapse the overall position. The critique has some force by presenting plausible realist frameworks (Aristotelian naturalism, constitutivism) where moral facts are connected to agency/flourishing and hence could be less alien and potentially more motivating. However, it mainly shows that the essay\u2019s realism-to-alienness move is not forced; it doesn\u2019t establish that realism is likely to be naturalist/constitutivist, nor that such views guarantee motivation/alignment in the strong way claimed. Several claims (e.g., that recognizing truth would \u2018inherently align\u2019 with motivation) are philosophically contestable, so correctness is moderate. The point is clear, focused, and contains little extraneous material.",
