  "reasoning": "The critique targets a sub-argument in \u00a72.3.2 (abundance \u2192 altruism via diminishing returns to self-interest). That point is not central to the essay\u2019s main conclusions (the authors already doubt WAM-convergence and only treat abundance as a limited, non-decisive push), so centrality is modest. The critique\u2019s core move\u2014self-interested utility can remain (near-)linear because tech creates new high-ceiling consumption/positional/solipsistic sinks\u2014would weaken that optimism lever, but the essay itself already anticipates much of this (explicitly noting linear self-interested preferences, positional goods, and weak wealth\u2013charity correlations). So it adds limited additional refutation beyond what\u2019s already \u201cpriced in,\u201d yielding low strength. The factual/plausibility claims are mostly reasonable though partly speculative (e.g., \u2018may never be reached\u2019), and the point is clearly and tightly argued with little fluff.",
