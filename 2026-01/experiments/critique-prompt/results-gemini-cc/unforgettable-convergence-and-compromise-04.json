  "reasoning": "The critique targets a real component of the essay\u2019s case against WAM-convergence: that even if agents learn the correct moral view, they may not be motivated to act on it (and may avoid such beliefs). However, this is only one strand among several major strands in the overall argument (especially the antirealist-divergence story, and social/political blockers), so centrality is limited. Its refutation force is also limited: the essay explicitly discusses internalism vs externalism already, and the main issue is not metaphysical possibility but sociological/strategic likelihood (whether powerful actors would choose to build/instantiate agents whose moral beliefs are constitutively motivating and aligned with \u201cthe good de dicto\u201d). The critique is partly correct that there\u2019s no physical necessity of akrasia and that architectures can tightly couple evaluation and motivation, but it overstates by claiming the essay \u2018relies on\u2019 a Humean separation and \u2018anthropomorphizes AI\u2019\u2014the essay considers multiple motivational architectures and still worries about non-deference, constrained reflection, and preference for not internalizing demanding moral truths. The critique is clear, focused on a single point, and contains little dead weight.",
