  "reasoning": "The critique targets a significant enabling assumption behind the essay\u2019s most promising route to mostly-great futures (Section 3: moral trade/compromise): that there will be distinct, persistent agents/groups with separable bargaining positions. If that assumption fails, the trade story is materially weakened, though the essay has other routes (WAM-convergence, self-interest/instrumental-good paths), so centrality is substantial but not total. However, the critique\u2019s refutation power is limited: it gestures at plausible post-AGI dynamics (copying, self-modification, merging) but doesn\u2019t establish that \u2018agent dissolution\u2019 is likely, dominant, or incompatible with bargaining (e.g., bargaining could occur between coalitions, decision procedures, AI delegates, forks/copies with divergent goals, or via contract/constitution design even in fluid agent ontologies). Several claims are overstated (e.g., \u201cAlice can simply absorb Bob\u201d or that assimilation/imposition is the default), but the core point\u2014that post-AGI identity/agency may not support the assumed bargaining model\u2014is mostly plausible. The argument is clear, focused on one issue, and contains little filler.",
