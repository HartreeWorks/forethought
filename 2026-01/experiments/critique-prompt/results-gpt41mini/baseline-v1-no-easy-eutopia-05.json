  "reasoning": "The critique targets an important implicit assumption behind the \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d conclusion: that moral catastrophe/fragility won\u2019t be robustly self-corrected by default dynamics (cultural evolution, feedback, moral progress). If strong self-correction were likely, the \u2018target\u2019 might effectively be larger, weakening the paper\u2019s pessimism about landing near-best conditional on survival. However, the essay explicitly brackets \u2018navigation/steering\u2019 forces (and flags them as a topic for the next essay), and the critique mostly notes an omission/possibility rather than providing an object-level argument that such self-corrective dynamics are in fact strong enough to overcome the listed fragilities. So centrality is moderate, but strength is low. The factual claim that the paper doesn\u2019t engage deeply with cultural evolution/feedback literature seems correct, and the point is understandable though somewhat generic. It focuses on a single issue with little extraneous content.",
