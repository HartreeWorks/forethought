  "reasoning": "The critique mainly targets the essay\u2019s closing suggestion (Section 4) that convergence/compromise might still guide society to a near-best future despite eutopia being a narrow target. That\u2019s not central to the essay\u2019s main thesis (\u201cno easy eutopia\u201d: mostly-great futures are rare/fragile under many moral views); even if convergence were unlikely, the core argument that eutopia is hard remains largely intact. So centrality is low-moderate. Its argumentative force is limited: it leans on broad historical parallels (schisms, revolutions, regime collapse) without specifying a mechanism showing that future convergence/compromise is impossible rather than just difficult, and it doesn\u2019t engage the essay\u2019s framing that convergence is a possibility, not an assumption. Many points are compatible with the essay\u2019s own \u2018fragility\u2019 theme, so it weakly challenges rather than refutes. The historical generalization is partly correct (stability often fails; aiming at singular ideals can provoke conflict), but the stronger claim of \u201csystematically unattainable\u201d is under-argued and likely overstated. The critique is understandable but somewhat vague about what exactly in the paper is \u201coptimism\u201d and what institutional features would need to be unprecedented. It stays on one issue and contains little pure filler.",
