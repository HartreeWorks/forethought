  "reasoning": "The critique targets Section 3.5 on moral uncertainty/intertheoretic aggregation. That material is not central to the essay\u2019s main case for \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d (which largely rests on eutopian fragility and the claim that most plausible first-order moral views are fussy); undermining 3.5 would mostly weaken a subsidiary upshot about how moral uncertainty affects decision guidance, so centrality is low (~0.2). Strength is also low because the critique is essentially a generic conditional (\u201cif intertheoretic comparisons are impossible, aggregation collapses\u201d) and does not engage with the essay\u2019s actual stance (it explicitly flags thorniness, explores multiple normalization schemes, and avoids pushing strong conclusions). Still, it does press on a real vulnerability: if one rejects intertheoretic comparability entirely, the essay\u2019s specific \u2018fussy under moral uncertainty\u2019 suggestion becomes underdetermined. The point is mostly correct in spirit, though overstated as \u2018undermining\u2019 the broader thesis, hence moderate-high correctness. It is clearly stated, focused on a single issue, and has little dead weight.",
