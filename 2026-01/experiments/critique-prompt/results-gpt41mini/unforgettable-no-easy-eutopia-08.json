  "reasoning": "The critique targets one illustrative pathway to \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d (space resource settlement locking in bad allocations). That\u2019s relevant, but it\u2019s only one example among many intended to support eutopian fragility/fussiness, so centrality is low-moderate. It somewhat weakens the specific inference from early settlement to near-permanent lock-in by pointing to reversible/dynamic institutional designs, but the original text already allows for multiple allocation regimes and doesn\u2019t strictly require irreversible zero-sum lock-in for the broader thesis (it\u2019s enough that plausible decisions can be morally catastrophic on many views). The critique is mostly correct and clear, though it slightly overstates the paper\u2019s commitment to \u201cpermanent, rigid\u201d lock-in. Little to no dead weight; it is focused on a single issue. Overall, it poses a limited challenge to one sub-argument, not a major threat to the main position.",
