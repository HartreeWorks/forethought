  "reasoning": "The critique targets a supporting premise in Section 3.2: that linear unbounded views are fussy because value-per-resource is (treated as) fat-tailed, making near-best use extremely specific. If that premise failed, the \u201clinear views are necessarily fussy\u201d sub-claim would be weakened, but the overall \u201cno easy eutopia\u201d position has multiple other supports (multiplicative fragility in Section 2; bounded-view arguments in 3.3; and even within 3.2 the scale-requirement part doesn\u2019t rely on fat tails). So centrality is moderate-low. Strength is limited because the critique is mostly a generic parameter-sensitivity point: it doesn\u2019t argue that non-fat-tailed (or sufficiently non-concentrated) value-efficiency distributions are actually plausible, nor that paradigm changes would likely broaden the near-optimal set; and the essay already gestures at uncertainty/robustness (\u201cexpected distribution is fat-tailed\u201d). Still, it correctly identifies a hinge where the argument\u2019s robustness could be challenged. Minimal dead weight; it\u2019s a single focused issue and reasonably clear.",
