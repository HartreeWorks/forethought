  "reasoning": "The critique targets the paper\u2019s reliance on qualitative reasoning and informal probabilistic claims as insufficiently formal/rigorous for verification and for informing mechanism design. This is somewhat central insofar as the position leans on claims like fat-tailed value-efficiency and \u201cmultiplicative fragility,\u201d but it mostly challenges evidential/engineering usefulness rather than the truth of the no-easy-eutopia thesis itself, so centrality is moderate. Strength is low because the critique is generic (calls for formal models) and doesn\u2019t engage specific premises, provide counterexamples, or show that the informal arguments fail; at most it modestly undercuts confidence. Correctness is mixed: the essay does contain substantial formalization (toy multiplicative model, VNM setup, bounded/unbounded cases), so \u201cno formal specifications\u201d is overstated, though it\u2019s fair that many empirical/probabilistic assumptions aren\u2019t fully parameterized or made computationally testable. The critique is clear, focused on one issue, and has little dead weight.",
