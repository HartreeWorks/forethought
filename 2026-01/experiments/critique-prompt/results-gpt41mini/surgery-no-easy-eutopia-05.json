  "reasoning": "The critique targets a specific step in the paper\u2019s case against \u201ceasygoing\u201d views: the claim that low-bounded, difference-making, jointly aggregating bounded views are implausible because of scale-tipping. If that dismissal failed, the paper would lose one of its main reasons for thinking the only easygoing slice is unattractive\u2014so it\u2019s somewhat central, though not decisive given the paper\u2019s many other routes to \u2018fussiness\u2019 (fragility arguments; linear/unbounded arguments; other bounded-view arguments). However, the critique is mostly a speculative loophole (\u201cmaybe the cliff only appears beyond practical scales\u201d) without engaging the paper\u2019s intended cosmological scales (10^22 stars) or the normative nature of the scale-tipping worry (the claim that such sharp regime-changes are implausible even if reachable). So it only weakly undermines the attacked claim. The point is broadly coherent/possible, but underspecified about what \u2018reasonable scales\u2019 are and why far larger scales wouldn\u2019t be practically attainable for an advanced civilization.",
