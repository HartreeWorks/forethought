  title: "An overview of some international organisations, with their voting structures"

premises_taken_as_given:
  - claim: "The governance structure of international organisations is a critical design variable with major consequences for effectiveness, legitimacy, and participation"
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "The entire paper is structured around cataloguing and analysing voting rules as important design choices, without arguing that governance design matters"
  - claim: "Historical precedents from international organisations are relevant and informative for designing governance of AGI development"
    confidence: "near-certain"
    evidence: "The paper is part of the 'international AGI project series' and repeatedly evaluates organisations as analogies for AI governance (IAEA, Intelsat, ITER), treating this relevance as given"
  - claim: "AGI development will require some form of international institutional governance"
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "The paper's existence within the series and its focus on extracting design lessons for AI governance presuppose this; the paper never argues for the need itself"
  - claim: "The US will be the leading actor in AGI development and its participation in any governance arrangement is essential"
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "The paper consistently evaluates organisations from the perspective of whether powerful states (especially the US) would join, and highlights the ISA's failure to attract the US as a cautionary tale"
  - claim: "Weighted voting among Western allies is likely feasible for an AGI governance body"
    confidence: "strong"
    evidence: "The paper tentatively argues this based on evidence that opposition to weighted voting comes mainly from developing nations, and that UK/Netherlands have recently joined weighted-voting orgs"

distinctive_claims:
  - claim: "Weighted voting is controversial primarily among developing nations, not among Western allies, making it a feasible mechanism for a US-led coalition governing AGI"
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "Historical opposition to weighted voting came from developing countries; UK and Netherlands have recently joined weighted-voting orgs (AIIB, ESM) without major objections, suggesting Western allies would accept it"
  - claim: "Intelsat is a particularly instructive model for AGI governance because it shows a dominant power (the US) voluntarily trading some control for the legitimacy and strategic benefits of multilateralism"
    centrality: "load-bearing"
    key_argument: "The US could have built satellite communications unilaterally but chose a multilateral structure with weighted voting for PR and strategic benefits; this parallels the AGI case where allies are even more needed"
  - claim: "International organisations' voting rules are typically 'hacky' products of specific negotiations rather than principled designs, suggesting that pragmatic negotiation rather than ideal theory should guide AGI governance design"
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "Multiple examples cited (Council of EU Treaty of Nice, ISA's four-chamber system, Intelsat's time-decaying supermajority thresholds) show rules emerging from ad hoc bargaining"
  - claim: "The strictest voting rules (unanimity or high supermajorities) cluster around hard power issues (money, security) and constitutional amendments, suggesting AGI governance should reserve strict rules for analogous high-stakes decisions"
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "Cross-cutting pattern observed across ISA (unanimity for benefit distribution), IMF (85% for quota changes), NATO (unanimity), EU (unanimity for tax/security)"
  - claim: "The IAEA model has significant weaknesses as an analogy for AI governance, particularly around verification difficulty, speed of development, and the centrality of private actors"
    centrality: "supporting"
    key_argument: "AI systems are harder to verify than nuclear materials, IAEA developed too slowly for AI timelines, and AI development is led by private companies rather than states"

positions_rejected:
  - position: "IAEA-style governance can straightforwardly transfer to AI"
    why_rejected: "AI systems are black boxes harder to verify than nuclear materials, AI development is faster than IAEA's pace, and key actors are private companies not states"
  - position: "Democratic legitimacy of founding members determines the choice of voting rules in international organisations"
    why_rejected: "Blake and Payton (2015) find no significant correlation between founding members' democracy levels and voting rule choice"
  - position: "Consensus/unanimity decision-making maximises institutional effectiveness"
    why_rejected: "Empirical evidence from Panke et al. (2022) shows consensus rules decrease perceived problem-solving effectiveness; theoretical analysis shows high decision costs and gridlock"
  - position: "One-size-fits-all voting rules are appropriate for international organisations"
    why_rejected: "The paper repeatedly emphasises that organisations use different rules for different bodies and issue types, and that the strictest rules should be reserved for the most consequential decisions"

methodological_commitments:
  - "Informal literature review drawing on international law, political science, and IR scholarship, with explicit acknowledgment of limitations (~20 hours, not domain expert)"
  - "Comparative institutional analysis: systematically cataloguing and classifying organisations by structural features to identify empirical patterns"
  - "Historical case study reasoning: tracing the evolution of voting rules over time to understand path dependencies and feasibility constraints"
  - "Explicit use of LLM-assisted research, acknowledged transparently"
  - "Pragmatic analogical reasoning: evaluating historical organisations for lessons applicable to AGI governance, with attention to both analogies and disanalogies"
  - "Trade-off analysis framing: consistently presenting voting rules in terms of decision costs vs. exploitation costs, rather than seeking optimal designs"
