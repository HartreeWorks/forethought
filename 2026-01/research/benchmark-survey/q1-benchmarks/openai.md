# Benchmarks for Evaluating LLM Critiques and Arguments

## Comprehensive List of Relevant Benchmarks and Datasets

**CMU Conceptual Reasoning (LM-Critique Benchmark)** – Developed by Cooper & Oesterheld at CMU, this benchmark targets **critiquing ability in philosophical and “fuzzy” domains** (e.g. ethics, AI alignment). It consists of **224 short texts** (each presenting an argument or theory) and **608 critique pairs** with **expert human ratings** ([www.andrew.cmu.edu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/conceptual_reasoning_benchmark.html#:~:text=Number%20of%20critique%20pairs%3A%20608)). Each text has multiple critiques, and experts ranked which critique is more valid or insightful. *Methodology:* Pairwise **comparative evaluation** – models must predict which of two critiques was rated higher by experts. *Availability:* Dataset not yet fully public (an early description is online) ([www.andrew.cmu.edu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/conceptual_reasoning_benchmark.html#:~:text=human%20expert%20ratings%20of%20the,or%20getting%20factual%20questions%20correct)), but it’s highly relevant as it provides **ground-truth expert judgments on argument critiques** in philosophical contexts.

**IBM Debater “ArgQuality” (IBM-Rank-30k)** – A large-scale dataset from IBM Research for **argument quality assessment** ([paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ibm-rank-30k#:~:text=Texts%20Edit%20%23%20IBM,a%20corpus%20of%2030%2C497%20arguments)). It contains **30,497 short arguments** (from an online debate forum) **annotated with quality scores** ([paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ibm-rank-30k#:~:text=corpus%20of%2030%2C497%20arguments%20carefully,wise%20quality)). Arguments are on varied controversial topics, and crowdworkers rated their overall quality or convincingness, enabling both **pointwise scores and pairwise rankings**. *What it evaluates:* The **overall quality of argumentative text** – clarity, strength of reasoning, use of evidence, etc., as perceived by annotators. *Structure:* Provided as a ranking task (which arguments are better) or a regression (quality score). *Methodology:* **Pairwise comparisons** were aggregated into a global ranking ([paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ibm-rank-30k#:~:text=corpus%20of%2030%2C497%20arguments%20carefully,wise%20quality)). *Availability:* **Open dataset** on Hugging Face and via IBM, often called *IBM ArgQ* or *ArgQuality* dataset. **Relevance:** Directly measures argument persuasiveness/quality in general topics, useful for testing an LLM’s ability to judge argument strength.

**ArgAnalysis35K (ArgQuality Analysis Corpus)** – A **2023 ACL dataset of 34,890 “argument–analysis” pairs** for nuanced argument quality evaluation ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.778/#:~:text=Debating%20to%20create%20a%20dataset,to%20a%20range%20of%20topics)). Each pair has an argument and an analytical critique or explanation, with **expert debater annotations**. The researchers (Joshi et al. 2023) leveraged debate expertise to cover a wide range of topics with diverse viewpoints ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.778/#:~:text=Argument%20Quality%20Detection%20is%20an,With%2034%2C890%20high)). They introduced a **scoring system for argument quality** that accounts for annotator reliability ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.778/#:~:text=Debating%20to%20create%20a%20dataset,to%20a%20range%20of%20topics)). *Evaluation:* Arguments are scored on relevance and strength given a topic, and analyses are judged for quality. Likely a **pointwise rating** dataset (with a custom scoring formula) rather than simple binary comparisons. *Availability:* Should be released with the ACL paper (check the ACL Anthology or authors’ page). *Relevance:* Focuses on **argumentative reasoning and critique** with a large, diverse set – suitable for training or evaluating how well an LLM assesses arguments across many domains.

**UKP ConvArg Corpus (Convincing Arguments, 2016)** – A **persuasive argument dataset** from UKP Lab (Habernal & Gurevych 2016) focusing on **what makes an argument convincing**. It includes **9,111 argument pairs** drawn from online debates (e.g. idebate or forums), each pair labeled with which argument was more convincing ([mirror.aclweb.org](https://mirror.aclweb.org/emnlp2016/program/280.html#:~:text=corpus%20containing%209%2C111%20argument%20pairs%2C,licenses%20to%20the%20research%20community)). Additionally, arguments are annotated with **17 fine-grained attributes** of argument quality or flaws ([mirror.aclweb.org](https://mirror.aclweb.org/emnlp2016/program/280.html#:~:text=corpus%20containing%209%2C111%20argument%20pairs%2C,under%20permissive%20licenses%20to%20the)) (e.g. logical fallacies, style, rhetoric), enabling analysis of *why* an argument won. *Methodology:* **Pairwise preference** judgments via crowdworkers, plus multi-label annotation of argument features. *Availability:* **Openly available** (CC BY license) via the authors’ GitHub ([github.com](https://github.com/UKPLab/emnlp2016-empirical-convincingness#:~:text=,0%20International%20License)). *Relevance:* Provides human preferences on argument persuasiveness and identifies specific **flaws or strengths** – useful for evaluating LLM critiques that point out weaknesses in arguments.

**GAQCorpus (Grammarly’s Argument Quality Corpus)** – A **theory-driven argument quality dataset** (Lauscher et al. 2020) annotated along **classical dimensions of argumentation**. It covers **three domains** of online text (Q&A forums, debate forums, and reviews) with arguments scored on **logic, rhetoric, and dialectic quality** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/20/4088#:~:text=Assessing%20the%20quality%20of%20arguments,grained%20dimensions.%20Following)) ([paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/rhetoric-logic-and-dialectic-advancing-theory#:~:text=targeting%20individual%20dimensions%20of%20argumentation,serve%20as%20strong%20baselines%20for)). This is a large corpus (exact size not stated here, but aimed to be “large-scale”) and provides **dimension-wise scores** (not just a single quality rating). *What it evaluates:* granular aspects – logical soundness, rhetorical effectiveness, and dialectical strength (consideration of counterpoints). Annotators were trained in argumentation theory, yielding a **multi-dimensional score per argument**. *Evaluation methodology:* Models can be evaluated on predicting each dimension score or an overall quality. *Availability:* The corpus (dubbed **GAQCorpus**) was introduced in COLING 2020; it might be available via the authors or on request (it’s referenced as a “Grammarly” corpus). *Relevance:* If you want to assess **specific qualities of arguments (e.g. logical consistency or rhetorical appeal)**, this dataset provides labeled data and a framework for multi-factor judgment.

**ChangeMyView “Winning Arguments” (Reddit CMV Corpus)** – A corpus from the r/ChangeMyView subreddit where people debate opinions, with a built-in measure of persuasion success. This **dataset of conversations** includes **which replies succeeded in changing the original poster’s view** (indicated by receiving a “delta” award) ([convokit.cornell.edu](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/winning.html#:~:text=convokit%20,Each%20ConvoKit)). *What it evaluates:* **Persuasive effectiveness in real-world arguments**. Instead of an explicit score, an argument’s quality is measured by its outcome (did it convince someone?). The Convokit version of this corpus contains **thousands of arguments** (spanning 2013–2015) with metadata on success ([convokit.cornell.edu](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/winning.html#:~:text=convokit%20,Each%20ConvoKit)). *Methodology:* **Implicit pairwise outcome** – successful vs unsuccessful arguments on the same topic can be compared. Researchers have used it to train classifiers of argument convincingness. *Availability:* **Open** via Cornell’s ConvoKit and pushshift Reddit data. *Relevance:* Although noisier than expert annotations, it provides a **large-scale, philosophically open-domain set of persuasive arguments** with a clear “ground truth” of impact, useful for testing if an LLM’s critiques align with what actually convinces people.

**Persuasion For Good (Persuasive Dialogues)** – A **dialogue corpus of 1,017 chats** where one person tries to persuade another to donate to charity ([convokit.cornell.edu](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/persuasionforgood.html#:~:text=documentation%20convokit.cornell.edu%20%20convokit%20,dataset%20contains%201017%20conversations%2C%20along)). This was a controlled data collection (Xiushi et al. 2019) with crowd workers assigned roles of *persuader* and *persuadee*. The dataset logs conversation strategies and whether the persuasion was successful (did the persuadee agree to donate). *What it evaluates:* **Interactive argumentation and persuasion techniques** – including emotional appeals, reasoning, etc., in a back-and-forth format. It provides a more **dynamic setting** for argument quality (the quality is reflected in conversation outcomes and strategy annotations). *Evaluation methodology:* One can evaluate an LLM on generating persuasive dialogue or judging which strategies are effective. Success can serve as the metric (binary outcome). *Availability:* **Open access** (available through ConvoKit and the authors’ GitHub). *Relevance:* Good for testing **LLM critiquing in a dialogue context** – e.g., can the LLM judge if a conversational argument was strong or suggest better persuasive moves.

**Logical Fallacy Detection (Logic & LogicClimate)** – A dataset introduced in 2021 for evaluating a model’s ability to **spot logical fallacies** in arguments ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.532/#:~:text=common%2C%20and%20some%20exacerbate%20problems,underlying%20logical%20structure%20of%20the)). It consists of **3,760+ arguments** (news articles, editorials, forum posts) annotated with the presence and type of a logical fallacy (e.g. *ad hominem*, *slippery slope*, *red herring*). There is also a specialized subset focusing on climate-change misinformation (LogicClimate) ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.532/#:~:text=common%2C%20and%20some%20exacerbate%20problems,underlying%20logical%20structure%20of%20the)). *What it evaluates:* **Argument validity and flaw identification** – a crucial aspect of critique quality. A good critique should flag fallacies, and this dataset provides ground truth for whether a given text contains one. *Evaluation methodology:* **Classification task** – models must label each argument with the correct fallacy or “no fallacy”. Performance is measured by accuracy/F1 on fallacy identification. *Availability:* **Open** (the dataset and annotation guidelines are usually released with the EMNLP 2021 paper by N. Al-Khatib et al.). *Relevance:* While not a direct “quality score” benchmark, it addresses the **logical soundness** of arguments – an important facet of critique. An LLM grader should be able to detect these flaws, so this dataset can validate that capability.

**Argument Reasoning Comprehension (ARCT, SemEval-2018 Task 12)** – A benchmark focusing on **warrants (implicit reasoning) in arguments** ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/S18-1121/#:~:text=SemEval,given%20as%20premises%20for%20the)). It contains about **1,000 instances** where an argument’s conclusion and premises are given and the task is to choose the correct underlying assumption (warrant) from two options. *What it evaluates:* **Understanding of argument structure and logical consistency**. Although it’s a multiple-choice format, it tests if a model can analyze an argument and identify which reasoning makes it valid (versus an irrelevant or fallacious reason). *Methodology:* Models are evaluated on accuracy of picking the correct warrant. *Availability:* **Open** (data and solutions published for SemEval 2018). *Relevance:* This dataset isn’t about free-form critique, but it **assesses deep reasoning** – useful to gauge if an LLM grasps argument logic, a skill needed for high-quality critiques. It complements the other sets by checking reasoning in a more constrained setup.

**SummEval (Summarization Evaluation Benchmark)** – An evaluation dataset for **research-paper summarization quality**, included here by analogy to research writing assessment. It contains **1,700 summaries** of news articles produced by various systems, each rated by **experts on 4 dimensions**: coherence, consistency (factual correctness), fluency, and relevance ([huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/datasets/davidanugraha/SummEval#:~:text=stringclasses%20100%20values%20%20,expert_relevance%20float64%201%205)). Each summary has **Likert-scale scores** for these aspects (1 to 5). *What it evaluates:* **Overall writing quality and accuracy** of summaries – essentially, how well a model condenses complex content. While domain-specific to news, the human evaluation setup is relevant: it shows how to systematically rate text on multiple qualitative criteria. *Methodology:* Humans rated each summary on the four metrics; the dataset can be used to evaluate models by correlating model-generated scores or rankings with the human scores. *Availability:* **Open** (released with Fabbri et al. 2021; data on Hugging Face). *Relevance:* For our use, SummEval demonstrates a **rubric-based evaluation of long-form text**, similar to how we might evaluate research-style writing. An LLM grader should ideally reproduce these human judgments on coherence and clarity in complex summaries. (If needed, one could adapt this to summaries of philosophical or technical content to evaluate our grader.)

**PERSUADE 2.0 (Argumentative Essays Corpus)** – A **large corpus of 25,000 student essays** (grades 6–12) focused on argumentative writing, introduced in 2024 ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075293524000588#:~:text=The%20PERSUADE%202,The)). Essays respond to prompts (independent or source-based), and each is scored by expert graders using a standardized **6-point rubric** ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075293524000588#:~:text=scoring%20rubric,based%20essays.%20The%20main)). A score of 6 indicates a well-mastered argumentative essay (clear claim, strong reasoning, good structure). *What it evaluates:* **Quality of written arguments in essay form**. This includes clarity of thesis, quality of reasoning and evidence, organization, and writing mechanics. *Methodology:* **Pointwise holistic scoring** – each essay gets a single score (1–6) based on a detailed rubric (interval scale) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075293524000588#:~:text=scoring%20rubric,based%20essays.%20The%20main)). The dataset likely also includes metadata (grade level, prompt, maybe sub-scores). *Availability:* **Open-source** corpus (the paper claims open access and it’s under a CC license). The dataset can be obtained via the journal or authors’ repository. *Relevance:* Although it’s about student essays, the scale and rubric are directly relevant for an LLM grader: it’s a real-world example of humans grading argumentation quality in writing. It can be used to check if the LLM’s grading aligns with human grades on sample essays or to fine-tune the grader on rubric-based evaluation.

**Anthropic HHH Alignment Dataset (Helpfulness & Harmlessness)** – An industry-produced dataset used to train and evaluate **LLM judges** on open-ended responses. Anthropic’s **HHH corpus** contains **human preference comparisons** for AI-generated answers, focusing on how **helpful, honest, and harmless** they are ([www.atyun.com](https://www.atyun.com/datasets/info/Anthropic/hh-rlhf.html?lang=en#:~:text=...%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E9%9B%86%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D%20%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E6%B8%85%E5%8D%95%20%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%20,Assistant%20with%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20from)). While not specific to philosophical arguments, it includes many general Q&A and advice scenarios where models had to be **evaluated on response quality** (helpfulness often correlates with giving a correct, well-reasoned answer). *What it evaluates:* General **response quality and alignment** with human preferences (covering logical correctness, completeness of explanation, appropriateness). *Method:* Primarily **pairwise comparisons** – e.g., given two model answers to the same query, which one did humans prefer (and why)? This data was used to train a reward model for RLHF. *Availability:* **Open** (Anthropic released the HH-RLHF preference data under MIT license). *Relevance:* It offers a **framework for LLM-as-judge** evaluation in the wild. For our needs, it’s a reminder that large-scale preference data exists (tens of thousands of comparisons) – our grader could be validated on a subset to ensure it agrees with human preferences on answer quality. (OpenAI similarly has released human feedback data for summarization and long-form QA which could be relevant if our grader will handle explanation quality in answers.)

**Additional:** *Big Bench & other reasoning tasks* – While not providing human quality ratings, tasks from the **BIG-Bench** and MMLU benchmarks cover **philosophical, commonsense, and reasoning questions**. For example, BIG-Bench includes sections on logical deduction, moral scenarios, and creative reasoning. These are **strict QA tasks** (with right/wrong answers) rather than subjective evaluation, so they aren’t direct fits for critique-quality assessment. They are worth noting for **testing LLM reasoning** in general, but since they lack human preference metrics, they serve better as inspiration for challenge questions than as grader benchmarks.

## Top 5–10 Most Promising Benchmarks for Our Use Case

Based on the above, here is a **ranked shortlist** of the benchmarks most relevant to evaluating our LLM grader, with rationale:

1. **CMU Conceptual Reasoning (LM-Critique)** – *Top choice:* It directly targets **philosophical argument critiques** with **expert ground-truth ratings ([www.andrew.cmu.edu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/conceptual_reasoning_benchmark.html#:~:text=Number%20of%20critique%20pairs%3A%20608))**. This aligns 100% with our use case: we can see if our grader agrees with experts on which critiques are better. The content (philosophy, alignment, policy arguments) is very similar to what we care about. *If accessible, this dataset provides the clearest validation of critique quality evaluation.*

2. **IBM ArgQuality (ArgQ-Rank-30k)** – *Large-scale and domain-diverse:* It has **thousands of crowd-rated arguments ([paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ibm-rank-30k#:~:text=corpus%20of%2030%2C497%20arguments%20carefully,wise%20quality))**, letting us test the grader on general argument quality. While topics vary (social/economic/political debates), the core task – judging an argument’s strength – matches our needs. It offers **pairwise comparisons and an overall quality score**, so we can use a subset (20–50 pairs) from the test set to see if the grader’s rankings correlate with the human rankings. *It’s easily available and provides a broad stress test for the grader’s judgment.* 

3. **UKP Convincing Arguments (ConvArg)** – *High relevance and manageable size:* It specifically evaluates **which of two arguments is more convincing ([mirror.aclweb.org](https://mirror.aclweb.org/emnlp2016/program/280.html#:~:text=corpus%20containing%209%2C111%20argument%20pairs%2C,licenses%20to%20the%20research%20community))**, and also identifies argumentation flaws. This is great for our grader: we can present two critiques or arguments and see if the grader picks the one humans picked. The content (web forum arguments) may be less scholarly, but the *convincingness* criterion is directly related to critique quality. With ~9k pairs, we can sample a small evaluation set easily. *Additionally, the fine-grained labels for flaws can help diagnose whether our grader catches logical fallacies or poor rhetoric.*

4. **Grammarly GAQCorpus (Logic, Rhetoric, Dialectic)** – *Fine-grained quality evaluation:* This dataset lets us test the grader on **specific aspects of argument quality**. For instance, we could specifically check if the grader’s “logical soundness” scores align with the GAQCorpus logic annotations, or its overall scores correlate with the human theory-based scores. The multi-domain nature (including Q&A and reviews) ensures the grader isn’t only good at formal essays but also at less structured arguments. *This is particularly useful if we want our grader to provide rubric-style breakdown (logic vs rhetoric), but even for overall quality it’s a strong benchmark.* (We may need to request the data, but it’s worth it for a deeper evaluation.)

5. **ArgAnalysis35K** – *Expert-debater annotated, variety of topics:* This new corpus is large and covers many topics with **reliable scoring methodology ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.778/#:~:text=Debating%20to%20create%20a%20dataset,to%20a%20range%20of%20topics))**. The reason it’s slightly lower ranked is because it’s very new (ensure the data is obtainable) and the scoring is somewhat complex (involving annotator reliability adjustments). However, it’s highly relevant: content likely includes philosophical and policy arguments and critiques, mirroring our interests. *Using a sample from this, we can see if our grader agrees with expert debaters on what makes a good analysis of an argument.* 

6. **ChangeMyView (Reddit)** – *Real-world persuasive success:* This is a different angle – it measures if an argument actually convinced someone. We include this because **our grader should ideally align with what is *actually* effective in persuasion**, not just abstract correctness. By testing on a set of CMV arguments (some that earned deltas vs those that didn’t), we can see if the grader scores the successful arguments higher. It’s large-scale and readily available, making it a convenient supplementary benchmark. *If our grader is good, a highly persuasive comment from CMV should receive a high score and a weak comment a low score.* Checking this can validate that the grader’s judgments aren’t just theoretically sound but also resonate with practical persuasive impact.

7. **PERSUADE 2.0 (Essay Corpus)** – *Rubric-based writing quality:* We rank this next as it provides a **different genre (student essays) with holistic scores**. It’s useful to see if our grader can generalize to scoring a full essay or research-style piece. We can take 20 essays scored by human raters and see if the grader’s scores (or relative ranks) match. The domain (school essays) is somewhat simpler than professional philosophy, but the criteria (clarity of argument, organization, evidence use) are similar. *If the grader truly evaluates “research-style writing”, it should perform well on identifying the well-argued essays vs the poorly argued ones.* This dataset is large and open, allowing plenty of testing without budget overhead.

8. **SummEval (Summary Quality)** – *Coherence and content fidelity:* We include SummEval to represent **evaluation of complex content digestion**. Our use case often involves summarizing or analyzing long arguments (like literature reviews). SummEval’s human scores for coherence and consistency can serve as a proxy to see if the grader can detect disorganized or factually inconsistent outputs. It’s not directly about arguments, but a critique often involves summarizing and highlighting issues in an argument – skills overlapping with summary evaluation. *Using SummEval, we can specifically check the grader’s ability to judge clarity and correctness in generated summaries or analyses.* It’s a bit domain-mismatched (news vs. research), which is why it’s lower in the top 10, but still valuable for calibrating general quality judgments.

*(Entries above #8 could be adjusted depending on data availability. For instance, if GAQCorpus or ArgAnalysis data are hard to obtain, we would elevate alternatives like logical fallacy or ARCT as needed.)*

## Recommendations and Next Steps

Given our **validation needs and resource constraints**, here’s how we suggest proceeding:

- **Prioritize benchmarks with expert human judgments and relevant content.** The CMU conceptual reasoning set and the **UKP ConvArg pairs** should be top priority. They offer **direct ground truth on critique quality** in domains close to ours (philosophy, web arguments). Start by obtaining a sample of ~20-50 items from these (e.g. 25 pairs of critiques from the CMU set, 25 pairs of arguments from ConvArg) and have our LLM grader evaluate them. Because we have ground-truth rankings, we can quantitatively measure the grader’s accuracy (e.g. % of pairwise decisions matching the human result).

- **Use large-scale datasets to check generalization.** After the targeted tests, use **IBM ArgQuality** and/or **ArgAnalysis35K** in a limited way: for example, take 30 random arguments from the test split and see if the grader’s scores correlate with the gold rankings or scores. We don’t need to exhaustively evaluate thousands of items – just enough to ensure the grader’s criteria aren’t overfitted to one style. These datasets cover **diverse topics and styles**, so a quick evaluation here will tell us if the grader can handle variety (economics arguments, social issues, etc.) and still align with human judgment.

- **Incorporate specific **error-analysis benchmarks** for diagnostic insight.** For instance, take a portion of the **Logical Fallacy** dataset and have the grader critique those arguments. Does it correctly identify the fallacies (e.g., calls them out as flaws)? Similarly, we can feed the grader arguments known to be factually incorrect or incoherent (from SummEval or a fact-check dataset) to see if it flags those issues. This qualitative check, using sets like **Logical Fallacies and SummEval**, will strengthen our confidence that the grader isn’t missing obvious problems in arguments.

- **Leverage rubric-based corpora for calibration.** Using **PERSUADE 2.0 or ASAP essay scores**, we can calibrate the grader’s scoring. For example, if human graders gave an essay a 4/6 for “adequate argumentation,” does our LLM grader also give a mid-tier score? We might choose 10 essays spanning low to high quality and compare. *This helps ensure our grader’s scale is in tune with human scoring standards.* With only ~20–30 samples we can identify if the grader systematically overrates or underrates compared to humans.

- **Validate with real-world effectiveness (optional).** As a stretch goal, test the grader on **ChangeMyView examples**: does it assign higher scores to posts that actually changed someone’s view? If yes, that’s a strong positive signal for its practical judgment. If not, we might inspect why (perhaps the grader values logical structure whereas humans were swayed by emotional appeal). This could reveal any **mismatch between theoretical quality and persuasive effectiveness**, which is useful for us to know.

- **Consider industry eval frameworks for long-term integration.** While not immediately focused on philosophical content, the **RLHF-style human preference datasets** (Anthropic’s HHH, OpenAI’s WebGPT feedback, etc.) are valuable for refining our grader. We might not use them in the initial 20–50 validation due to domain mismatch, but they illustrate best practices in LLM evaluation (e.g. doing **pairwise comparisons with a “win rate” metric, using multi-annotator agreement**). We should keep these in mind to possibly augment our grader’s training or for future benchmarks – especially if we expand into more general assistant behavior evaluation.

**In summary**, start with the **most directly relevant, high-quality sets (expert-rated critiques, convincingness pairs)** for a focused evaluation. Then widen the lens with a **few samples from broader datasets** to ensure robustness. This two-tier approach (narrow and deep, then broad and shallow) will give us confidence in the LLM grader’s performance without exceeding our small validation budget. By prioritizing the listed benchmarks, we can efficiently verify that our grader reliably assesses argument and critique quality in the nuanced domains we care about.
