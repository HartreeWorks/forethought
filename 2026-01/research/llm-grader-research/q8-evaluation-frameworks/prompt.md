# Research question: LLM evaluation frameworks and tools

## Question

What tools and frameworks exist beyond Promptfoo for evaluating LLM outputs, and which are best suited for evaluating research critiques?

## Context

We are building a system to evaluate AI-generated critiques of research papers for **Forethought Research**, a nonprofit focused on the transition to superintelligent AI. Their research sits at the intersection of philosophy and economics — examining AI governance, post-AGI economics, digital mind rights, and longtermist macrostrategy.

We're aware of Promptfoo for LLM evaluation but want to understand the full landscape of tools and whether there are better options for our use case.

## What we want to know

1. **Tool landscape:** What are the major LLM evaluation frameworks/tools? (e.g., Promptfoo, LangSmith, Weights & Biases Prompts, Braintrust, Humanloop, etc.)

2. **LLM-as-Judge support:** Which tools have built-in support for LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation patterns?

3. **Custom rubrics:** Which tools support custom evaluation rubrics and multi-dimensional scoring?

4. **Human-in-the-loop:** Which tools support hybrid human/LLM evaluation workflows?

5. **Small-N statistics:** Do any tools handle statistical validation with small sample sizes well?

6. **Open source vs. commercial:** What are the trade-offs? Are there good open-source options?

7. **Research tools:** Are there academic tools or frameworks specifically designed for research on LLM evaluation?

## Desired output

- Overview of major LLM evaluation tools and frameworks
- Comparison table of features relevant to our use case
- Recommendations for our specific use case (evaluating research critiques)
- Emerging tools or research frameworks worth watching
- Key resources for learning more
