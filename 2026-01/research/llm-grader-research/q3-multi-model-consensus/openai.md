# Multi-Model Consensus vs. Single LLM Judges

Researchers have found that using multiple language models as a “committee” of evaluators can improve reliability and alignment with human judgments. In other words, an ensemble of LLM judges tends to agree with human ratings more closely than a single model acting alone. For example, Badshah & Sajjad (2025) show that combining diverse LLMs as judges **“improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations”** on open-ended QA tasks, achieving a **stronger correlation with human evaluations** than any single model ([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2025.winlp-main.37/#:~:text=contextual%20depth%20of%20such%20generative,reliable%20alternative%20to%20traditional%20metrics)). Similarly, a recent **panel-of-models approach (PoLL)** from Cohere found that a **panel of smaller LLMs outperforms a single large judge (GPT-4)** in matching human preferences ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2,4)). In fact, **“utilizing PoLL is much more cost-effective and correlates more closely with human evaluations than using a single large judge like GPT-4” ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2,4))**, indicating clearly better human-alignment. This result held across several benchmark datasets, affirming that multi-model consensus can provide more **accurate and unbiased evaluations** of generated text ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=illustrate%20PoLL%E2%80%99s%20effectiveness,is%20explained%20by%20the%20following)) ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2,4)).

One major reason ensembles work better is that **individual LLM judges have identifiable biases** or blind spots. A single model might systematically favor responses written in its own style or share certain miscalibrations. For instance, GPT-4 as a lone judge can exhibit high variance (inconsistent ratings) with slight prompt changes ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40techsachin/replacing-judges-with-juries-llm-generation-evaluations-with-panel-of-llm-evaluators-d1e77dfb521e#:~:text=%2A%20In%20some%20scenarios%2C%20GPT,panel%20of%20heterogeneous%20evaluator%20models)), and often shows a *“judgment preference bias”* – a tendency to prefer answers it would have generated itself ([www.getmaxim.ai](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/llm-as-a-jury/#:~:text=1,generated%20outputs)). By contrast, **aggregating multiple models’ opinions tempers each model’s idiosyncrasies**. Diverse models will correct one another: mistakes or biases that one model has are less likely to be shared by all. Liu et al. (2025) call this a *“Group-Based Polling”* effect – their **Genii framework** integrates various LLM judges and shows that through iterative polling the ensemble **“effectively mitigates judgment preference bias”** and even **outperforms supervised judges trained on human labels** ([researchtrend.ai](https://researchtrend.ai/papers/2510.08145#:~:text=interactive%20client,All%20codes%20are)). In short, a **committee of LLMs provides a wisdom-of-crowds effect**, reducing systematic errors and yielding scores closer to what human evaluators would give ([openreview.net](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kv1QO17Mba#:~:text=reference,Our%20approach%20not)) ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=match%20at%20L72%204,varied%20panel%20of%20evaluator%20models)).

# Voting vs. Averaging vs. Advanced Ensembles

There are different ways to combine model judges, each with trade-offs:

- **Majority Voting:** If the evaluation is a choice (e.g. which of two critiques is better), each model can vote and the majority wins. This can dramatically reduce random errors. For instance, an education study found that when five LLM evaluators voted on the quality of feedback, the **majority vote matched the human-majority decision with high accuracy** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/671#:~:text=scored%20in%20the%20low%203,to%20a%20high%20overall%20accuracy)). Majority voting ensures that if at least half the models are correct (or align with humans), the ensemble’s decision will be correct. It’s a robust approach for pairwise comparisons or categorical ratings.

- **Score Averaging:** If models produce a numeric score (say 1–5 for critique quality), one can take the average. Averaging smooths out extreme opinions and noise. It treats each model’s judgment as a “vote weight.” This often improves agreement with humans by canceling out individual overshooting or undershooting. For example, Seo et al. (2025) reported that even though individual LLM graders differed in severity, **after averaging their scores the results closely mirrored the human consensus**, yielding high overall accuracy ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/671#:~:text=scored%20in%20the%20low%203,to%20a%20high%20overall%20accuracy)). The downside is that if one model is poorly calibrated (consistently too high or low), it can skew the average – so some form of normalization or weighting may be needed for fairness.

- **Weighted Voting/Averaging:** In more sophisticated setups, you might assign higher weight to certain models – e.g. if one model historically correlates better with humans, its vote counts slightly more. This can boost accuracy if the weights are set correctly, but it requires trust or validation data to tune those weights. If done poorly, weighting could reintroduce bias by over-relying on a single model’s perspective. In practice, simple unweighted averaging or majority voting often performs well unless there’s a clear reason to trust one model over others.

- **Committee with Arbiter Model:** Beyond static voting, researchers have experimented with using one model (or a small model) as an *arbiter* to reconcile the judges’ opinions. For example, the **EvalCouncil framework** creates a “committee” of multiple heterogeneous LLM graders and then passes all their scores and justifications to a **“chief” LLM** that arbitrates and decides the final grade ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=First%2C%20EvalCouncil%20introduces%20a%20committee,specific%20biases%2C%20ensuring%20that)). This arbiter doesn’t just take a simple average; it can be prompted to consider disagreements, apply rules (like rubric criteria), and produce a reasoned final verdict. This approach can improve transparency – the arbiter can explain how it combined the votes – and handle edge cases (like ties or close splits) more intelligently ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=Building%20on%20this%20perspective%2C%20committee,judgments%20and%20explicitly%20arbitrating%20disagreements)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=First%2C%20EvalCouncil%20introduces%20a%20committee,specific%20biases%2C%20ensuring%20that)). The trade-off is that the arbiter itself is an LLM subject to its own biases or errors, so it must be carefully prompted to remain objective. Still, properly designed arbitration can further close the gap with human-like evaluation, as it explicitly reasons through differences rather than blindly computing an average.

- **Iterative Consensus Methods:** Another advanced technique is to have the models discuss or refine their evaluations through multiple rounds. In Liu et al.’s *Genii* method, the ensemble operates in a multi-agent loop: a “server” agent collects judgments, shares some aggregated signal, and “client” agents update their evaluations iteratively ([researchtrend.ai](https://researchtrend.ai/papers/2510.08145#:~:text=paper%20introduces%20the%20Group,Further)). This process, akin to a deliberation or polling process, led all the models toward a more consistent consensus that aligned better with ground truth, **improving performance even for weaker models in the mix ([researchtrend.ai](https://researchtrend.ai/papers/2510.08145#:~:text=interactive%20client,All%20codes%20are))**. Such iterative schemes are complex to implement but can further reduce variance and bias by allowing models to correct each other over time (somewhat like humans debating and converging on an answer).

In practice, **simple ensemble methods (majority vote or averaging) already yield significant gains in reliability** for evaluating critiques. They are easy to implement and interpret. More sophisticated ensembles (with weighted votes or arbiter models) can add incremental improvement, especially in borderline cases, but come with added complexity. For our use case (scoring research critiques), a reasonable starting point is to have multiple LLMs rate each critique and **either take the majority opinion or average their scores**. If we find certain models systematically differ (e.g. one model gives higher scores on average), we can adjust for that or give that model’s vote slightly less weight. Down the line, if needed, we could explore an arbiter approach – for example, prompt GPT-4 to read the critiques **along with** the scores/explanations given by other models and have it produce a final adjudicated score. This “judge the judges” approach could combine the best of both worlds (human-like reasoning about the other models’ inputs with the raw diversity of opinions).

# The Importance of Model Diversity

**Diversity of the models in the ensemble is crucial.** Using the *same* model 5 times with different random seeds is usually much less effective than using 5 different models. The reason is that identical or closely related models will share many of the same biases and knowledge gaps – their errors will be correlated. The ensemble can only correct mistakes that at least one member doesn’t make. If all models are clones, an ensemble might just amplify a shared mistake (a sort of “echo chamber”). 

Empirical studies strongly support using **heterogeneous model families** in the panel. The Cohere PoLL research explicitly draws evaluators from *disjoint model families* (different architectures or training sources) for this reason ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40techsachin/replacing-judges-with-juries-llm-generation-evaluations-with-panel-of-llm-evaluators-d1e77dfb521e#:~:text=,panel%20of%20heterogeneous%20evaluator%20models)). They report that **diversity in the panel was key to reducing bias**: *“By assembling several smaller models from several model families into a PoLL, the bias that arises from relying solely on a single large model is lessened.”* ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=1.%20Decreased%20Intra,single%20large%20model%20is%20lessened)). In other words, each model has different blind spots, so a varied ensemble covers more ground and cancels out one another’s preferences ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=match%20at%20L72%204,varied%20panel%20of%20evaluator%20models)). For example, if Model A tends to prefer overly verbose answers and Model B tends to prefer very concise answers, a mix of them will avoid systematically favoring one style over the other. Likewise, one model might be better at catching logical fallacies, while another is better at judging factual accuracy – together, they can flag more issues than either alone.

In contrast, if you ensemble models that all come from the same provider or training pipeline (say, GPT-4 plus GPT-3.5, which share an RLHF alignment style), you might get only a small boost. Those models might all overlook the same missing counterargument or all be swayed by a similar writing style. **Using models from different developers (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source, etc.) or different sizes/architectures yields a more balanced evaluation**. Even ensembling different prompt variations of the **same** model can help a bit (since prompting can elicit different aspects of its knowledge), but not as much as truly different models. The PoLL study notes that GPT-4 by itself could sometimes be a “relatively weak judge” with unstable outputs ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40techsachin/replacing-judges-with-juries-llm-generation-evaluations-with-panel-of-llm-evaluators-d1e77dfb521e#:~:text=%2A%20In%20some%20scenarios%2C%20GPT,panel%20of%20heterogeneous%20evaluator%20models)) – it’s better to have a *jury* of varied models than to trust a single “star witness” model.

For Forethought’s domain (longtermist philosophy, economics, AI policy), model diversity might mean including both general models and ones fine-tuned on relevant knowledge. For instance, we could combine GPT-4 (strong general reasoning), Anthropic Claude (which may have different moral/ethical training nuances), and an open-source Llama-2 or a smaller model fine-tuned on economics papers. This heterogeneous committee would likely evaluate a critique more holistically. One model might catch a subtle philosophical inconsistency that another misses, while a third provides an alternate economic perspective. Diversity ensures no single model’s peculiar viewpoint dominates the grading.

# Accuracy Gains vs. Computational Cost

Using multiple models naturally **increases the computation cost**, so it’s important to assess the cost-benefit trade-off. The encouraging news is that the improvements in evaluation quality can be substantial even with a handful of models, and sometimes **a few smaller models together can match or beat one big model at lower cost**.

Studies have quantified this. The **PoLL approach achieved better alignment with humans *while being over 7× cheaper*** than using GPT-4 for every evaluation ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40techsachin/replacing-judges-with-juries-llm-generation-evaluations-with-panel-of-llm-evaluators-d1e77dfb521e#:~:text=,panel%20of%20heterogeneous%20evaluator%20models)) ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2.%20Cost,single%20large%20LLM%20for%20review)). This is because they replaced one very large model with a panel of several smaller (and cheaper-to-run) models. The ensemble of small models was **“more than seven times**” cost-efficient yet still superior in accuracy ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2.%20Cost,single%20large%20LLM%20for%20review)). In scenarios where API usage or compute is a limiting factor, this is a big win – you don’t necessarily need to call the most expensive model if a group of mid-sized models can do as well or better.

Of course, if you *do* use multiple *large* models, the cost adds up linearly. Three GPT-4 judges cost roughly three times a single GPT-4, which might only be worthwhile if each is providing somewhat independent judgments. In practice, you might not need to ensemble multiple *huge* models; one strong model augmented by a couple of weaker (cheaper) ones can capture most of the benefits. The returns on adding more models **diminish after a point** – going from 1 to 3 models might markedly boost accuracy, but going from 5 to 7 models might give only a tiny extra boost. Empirically, **small ensemble sizes (3–5 models) are often enough** to reach high agreement with humans ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/671#:~:text=scored%20in%20the%20low%203,to%20a%20high%20overall%20accuracy)), especially if those models are well-chosen and diverse.

For our use case, we should consider the **marginal benefit** of each additional model vs. its cost. If GPT-4 is one of the judges, adding a model like Claude 2 might cover some different ground at moderate cost – likely a good trade-off. Adding a third model (say an open-source Llama-2 70B or a smaller model fine-tuned on our domain) is relatively cheap and could catch niche issues, thus likely worth it. Beyond, say, 4 models, we might see diminishing returns – the ensemble’s judgment may have already stabilized. We can empirically test this on our validation set of critiques: for example, compare the human-correlations of a 2-model vs 4-model ensemble to see if the improvement justifies doubling the cost.

Another tactic to save cost is **multiple prompts to the same model** instead of entirely different models. This leverages the model’s stochasticity or different reasoning styles. Techniques like *self-consistency* have shown that sampling multiple reasoning paths from one LLM and then taking the majority answer improves accuracy on reasoning tasks significantly ([your-ai-staff.com](https://your-ai-staff.com/self-consistency-improves-chain-of-thought/#:~:text=%28%2B12.2,sampling%20strategies%20and%20imperfect%20prompts)). However, for *evaluation* tasks, using the **same model with the same prompt yields identical output (at temperature 0)**, so you’d have to vary the prompt or use a high temperature to get diverse opinions from one model. That can help a bit, but it’s less predictable and still incurs extra cost. In general, using truly different models is a more reliable way to get diversity than using one model in N different ways.

In summary, **multi-model grading will cost more than single-model, but it can be made cost-effective**. The strategy is to pick a small panel that gives the biggest accuracy boost per dollar. Often this means one top-tier model plus a few lower-tier ones. Given our high quality bar, spending, say, 2–3× more compute to substantially improve evaluator accuracy is likely worthwhile – especially if it automates something as expensive (in researcher hours) as vetting critique quality.

# Failure Modes and When Ensembles Can Backfire

While ensemble judging is promising, it’s not a silver bullet. There are scenarios where multi-model approaches can *fail or even degrade* the evaluation quality:

- **Common-Mode Errors:** If *all* models in the ensemble share a similar blind spot or bias, the consensus will be wrong as well. In fact, the models might reinforce each other’s confidence in a mistake. For example, if all your models were trained on similar data that underrepresents a certain philosophical viewpoint, they might unanimously misjudge a critique that comes from that viewpoint. The ensemble would give a confident but uniformly biased verdict. This is why diversity is so important – to minimize the chance of a common-mode failure. It’s also wise to include at least one model known for handling the domain; if all models are ignorant about a niche topic, they can’t magically produce a correct evaluation through voting.

- **Overwhelming the Truth**: An ensemble could overrule a correct outlier. Suppose one model actually gets the evaluation right (in line with human judgment) but two other models get it wrong in the same way – the majority vote will be wrong. In effect, *two wrongs beat one right*. This is a risk if you include weaker judges in the pool. If the weaker models are just adding random noise or systematic misjudgments, they might occasionally outvote the better model on a subtle question. To mitigate this, one can weight models by their expected accuracy or use an arbiter that can recognize when the “dissenting” opinion might be onto something. In practice, if your panel includes **one very strong model and several weaker ones, consider not giving equal weight blindly**. Ensure the weaker models genuinely add insight and don’t simply drag the score down.

- **Lack of Ground Truth / Ambiguity:** In some cases, even humans don’t agree on the correct evaluation – the criteria might be subjective or undefined. In a Forethought context, questions like “Does this critique meaningfully improve our approach?” could be interpreted differently. If an issue is genuinely ambiguous, an ensemble might just reflect that ambiguity or produce an arbitrary consensus. One study on educational feedback noted that for certain nuanced criteria, **both human annotators and LLMs struggled to be consistent**, leading to lower accuracy overall ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/671#:~:text=feedback%20generator%20model%20used%2C%20high,research%20to%20address%20these%20challenges)). In such cases, adding more models won’t magically produce consistency if the task itself is ill-defined. The ensemble might converge on a decision, but that decision could be somewhat arbitrary if there’s no clear truth to be had. This isn’t exactly the ensemble “failing” – it’s more the evaluation question needing refinement. The takeaway is to ensure the evaluation prompt/criteria are as clear as possible; where humans themselves would disagree, use ensemble outputs with caution.

- **Collusion or Mode Collapse:** If you allow models to interact naively (say, a chain of reasoning where one model’s output feeds into another’s without safeguards), you could get a kind of *collusion* or herding behavior. For instance, if you have a multi-turn debate between models but one model dominates the discourse, you lose the benefit of independent judgments. Most frameworks avoid this by keeping each model’s evaluation independent before combining at the end. However, if one uses an interactive consensus (like Genii’s iterative polling), you must watch out that it doesn’t simply converge to the loudest model’s opinion. The Genii paper showed good results, but in general an improperly designed interaction could lead the whole ensemble astray together. Keeping a level of independence (e.g. blind voting) in the process is important to preserve the “wisdom of crowds” effect rather than a premature convergence.

- **Aggregator Bias or Error:** If using a learned or model-based aggregator (like an arbiter LLM or a small meta-model that combines scores), that aggregator can introduce errors. For example, an LLM arbiter might be persuaded by a convincingly worded but incorrect explanation from one judge, tipping the final decision wrongly. Or a learned logistic regression might overfit to patterns in a small training set of human evaluations and mis-weight the inputs. It’s important to validate the final ensemble output against ground truth if possible, not just assume the ensemble is always right. A safeguard is to have a **human spot-check disagreements or uncertain cases** – e.g. if the models wildly disagree (split votes) or if the arbiter expresses low confidence, that could be flagged for human review. Luckily, ensembles can help identify these tricky cases: if even the AI judges can’t agree on a critique, it’s likely a subtle one worth a human look.

In summary, ensemble approaches **rarely make things worse than a single model on average**, but specific failure cases exist. Most of these failures come from *lack of true diversity or clarity*. By choosing varied, high-quality judges and defining clear evaluation standards, we reduce the risk. It’s also wise to monitor the ensemble’s output – for instance, track if there are systematic biases (maybe the ensemble still always scores a certain style of critique lower; then we’d know all models share a bias against that style). The good news is that research so far shows well-constructed ensembles are **more robust and stable** than single LLM evaluators, not less ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=Building%20on%20this%20perspective%2C%20committee,judgments%20and%20explicitly%20arbitrating%20disagreements)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=match%20at%20L337%20Committee,among%20multiple%20models%20lies%20in)). They offer a guard against the quirks of any one model.

# Practical Recommendations for Our Use Case

Given the evidence, a **multi-model consensus approach is strongly recommended** for evaluating AI-generated critiques in Forethought’s domains. Here are some concrete takeaways for our implementation:

- **Use a Panel of Diverse Models:** Aim for 3–5 models from different “families” or backgrounds. For example, one could use GPT-4, Anthropic Claude 2, maybe Google’s PaLM 2 or an open-source Llama2-chat, etc. Diversity will ensure we capture different angles on the critique. The Cohere PoLL results demonstrated that such a diverse panel **improved human alignment and cut bias** relative to relying on GPT-4 alone ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2,4)). This panel can operate in parallel (to minimize latency) and each model provides an independent evaluation.

- **Combine Judgments via Simple Ensemble Methods:** Start with straightforward majority voting or averaging of scores. These methods are easy to implement and were effective in multiple studies (often bringing model agreement up near human-agreement levels) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/671#:~:text=scored%20in%20the%20low%203,to%20a%20high%20overall%20accuracy)). For our scenario, we might prompt each model to rate a critique on a numerical scale (or give a categorical verdict like “valuable” vs “not valuable”). We can then average those scores or take the majority label. This alone should reduce randomness and smooth over individual model quirks.

- **Calibrate or Weight if Needed:** After an initial run, check if some model in the panel is consistently an outlier (e.g., always gives higher scores than the others). If so, we may calibrate its scores (e.g., subtract a bias term, or use z-scores) before averaging, or decide to weight that model’s vote a bit less. The goal is to prevent one biased model from skewing the result. In practice, if the models are all reasonably good (GPT-4, Claude, etc.), a simple equal-weight average or vote should be fine, as their outputs will likely correlate with true quality most of the time.

- **Consider an Arbiter for Edge Cases:** If resources allow, we could experiment with an “arbiter LLM” that takes all models’ evaluations and rationale as input and produces a final decision. This might be useful if our evaluation rubric is complex. For example, we could prompt an arbiter model like: *“Here are the ratings and key comments from 4 AI judges on this critique. Please reconcile them and give a final score, explaining if there was disagreement.”* This approach was shown to improve interpretability and maintain high agreement with humans in academic grading scenarios ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=First%2C%20EvalCouncil%20introduces%20a%20committee,specific%20biases%2C%20ensuring%20that)). It’s not necessary to start with an arbiter, but it could add value by providing a justification for the final grade and handling ties intelligently.

- **Leverage the Ensemble for Uncertainty:** One nice feature of having multiple judges is that **disagreement becomes a signal**. If our models are split 3-2 on whether a critique is good, that’s a sign the critique is contentious or borderline. We can use this information. For instance, we might only automatically accept critiques that, say, at least 4 out of 5 models rated highly (strong consensus), and send others to a human reviewer. This way, we maximize precision for the automated pipeline – only low-controversy critiques get through – and we alert researchers to cases where even the AIs aren’t sure. This triaging uses the ensemble not just for a score, but for an estimate of confidence (agreement level) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/12/530#:~:text=Building%20on%20this%20perspective%2C%20committee,judgments%20and%20explicitly%20arbitrating%20disagreements)).

- **Validate on Known Data:** Since we have ~20 human-rated critiques as a gold set, we should test our ensemble grader on those. Check the correlation or agreement with the human judgments. We expect to see an improvement in agreement using the multi-model approach versus any single model’s ratings. Indeed, literature suggests we could see significantly higher agreement – e.g., Cohen’s kappa or Pearson correlation improved when moving to a panel of judges by a notable margin ([www.getmaxim.ai](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/llm-as-a-jury/#:~:text=,ranked%20items)). If our results mirror the studies (aiming for >0.75 agreement with humans), that will validate the approach. With only 20 samples, statistical power is limited, but clear trends (like ensemble > single-model) should be observable. We can also qualitatively inspect where the ensemble disagreed with the human – those might highlight either limitations of the models or inconsistencies in human criteria, both informative going forward.

In conclusion, **multi-model consensus methods have a strong track record of boosting evaluation reliability in AI systems**. By using a diverse “jury” of AIs to grade AI-generated critiques, we tap into a form of *collective intelligence* that mitigates the biases or errors of any one model. Research papers and industry experiments consistently show higher alignment with human judgment from these approaches ([openreview.net](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kv1QO17Mba#:~:text=reference,Our%20approach%20not)) ([www.marktechpost.com](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/30/this-ai-research-from-cohere-discusses-model-evaluation-using-a-panel-of-large-language-models-evaluators-poll/#:~:text=2,4)). As long as we remain mindful of the limitations (ensuring diversity and monitoring for systematic issues), ensemble evaluators should substantially improve our ability to surface the most valuable critiques – which is exactly the scalability win we’re looking for. This will let Forethought’s researchers spend time on the critiques that matter, confident that the AI grader has done a rigorous first pass aligned with human standards.

Reinforces the value of ensemble voting in practice.

Each of these sources offers insight into ensemble evaluation techniques and their effectiveness. Adapting those lessons to the context of longtermist and AI-governance research critiques should give us a robust AI grading system – one that is both more **reliable** (agreeing with researchers’ judgments) and more **scalable**, unlocking those ambitious workflows we’re aiming for.
